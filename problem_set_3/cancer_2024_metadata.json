    "ArticleTitle": "Quality of outcome (QoO) in oral cancer patients: prospective perioperative analysis of patients' resilience and satisfaction during inpatient stay at a University Medical Centre in Germany.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Quality assurance strategies for head and neck surgery can improve patient outcomes. This study aims a perioperative analysis of indicators in the quality of outcome in oral cancer patients with special focus on patient`s resilience and satisfaction before and after surgery. METHODS: Patients with oral cancer (OCP) and indication for surgical resection were included in a prospective study. General and disease-related data as well as parameters of patient-specific resilience (RS-11 questionnaire) and physical strength (ECOG-Score) were collected. Importance and satisfaction using the nine items family/friends, sports activities/physiotherapy, participation in culture, professional perspectives, sexuality, enjoyable food, external appearance, social recognition and independence were analysed. The data collection took place pre- and postoperatively (mean: 10th postop day) during the inpatient stay. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with oral cancer (OCP) were analysed (male: n=23, female n=5). The rate of R0 resections was 92.6 %. The average length of stay was 21 days. n=16 of all patients was tracheotomised postop (preop: n=0). n=0 patients confirmed psycho(onco)logical support preop (postop: n=19). Sports activities/physiotherapy was provided to n=3 patients preop (postop: n=21). The mean pre and postop pain perception was 3/10. The RS-11 score decreased significantly postoperatively (p=0.01). A significant loss of satisfaction was seen in the areas of enjoyable food (p<0.001), social recognition (p=0.01), external appearance (p=0.01) and independence (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Supportive therapy measures to promote mental and physical fitness of oral cancer patients are part of inpatient care at our clinic. However, there is no standardised monitoring of these therapies. Digitally supported and standardised programmes to increase mental and physical fitness in both prehospital and inpatient care might lead to an improvement in the quality of outcome despite shortage of resources in terms of time, costs and personnel. A minimally invasive approach to tracheal cannula management and lymph node management in the treatment of OCP can help to reduce the length of stay in the intensive care unit.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Tumor-driven stromal reprogramming in the pre-metastatic lymph node.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Metastatic dissemination is critically reliant on the formation of a receptive niche, a process which is thought to rely on signals derived from the primary tumor. Lymph nodes are continuously exposed to such signals through the flow of afferent lymph, allowing the potential reprograming of lymphoid tissue stroma in support of metastases or immunosuppression. The objective of this study was therefore to better characterize tumor-driven transcriptomic changes occurring to specific stromal populations within the tumor-draining lymph node. METHODS: We utilize single cell RNA sequencing of dissociated LN tissue extracted from tumor-bearing and naïve mice to profile the reprograming of tissue stroma within the pre-metastatic lymph node. RESULTS: Resulting data provides transcriptomic evidence of tumor-induced imprinting on marginal reticular cells (MRCs) and floor lymphatic endothelial cells (fLECs) populating the subcapsular sinus. These alterations appear to be unique to the tumor-draining LN and are not observed during inflammatory antigenic challenge. Notably, MRCs exhibit characteristics reminiscent of early desmoplastic CAF differentiation, fLECs engage distinct chemoattractant pathways thought to facilitate recruitment of circulating cancer cells, and both stromal populations exhibit signs of metabolic reprograming and immune-modulating potential. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulatively, these findings build upon existing literature describing pre-metastatic niche formation and offer several promising avenues for future exploration.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Uncaria nervosa Elmer, a new herbal source for betulinic acid and ursolic acid: Metabolites profiling, isolation, and in vitro cytotoxicity studies against T47D breast cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Uncaria nervosa Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of Uncaria nervosa Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects. METHODS: This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. RESULTS: The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.0 1, 14.0 4, 9] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate. The ethanol extract of Uncaria nervosa Elmer leaves contains nine compounds consisting of alkaloids, terpenoids, and fatty acid. The bioactive compounds that were successfully isolated were betulinic acid, and ursolic acid, with IC 50 values of ˃100 and 14,70±4,50 μg/ml, respectively. These compounds were reported in this plant for the first time. CONCLUSION: Betulinic acid, and ursolic acid have been successfully isolated from leaves Uncaria nervosa Elmer, and ursolic acid have moderate cytotoxic activity on T47D breast cancer cells.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Stackelberg Evolutionary Games of Cancer Treatment: What Treatment Strategy to Choose if Cancer Can be Stabilized?",
    "AbstractText": "We present a game-theoretic model of a polymorphic cancer cell population where the treatment-induced resistance is a quantitative evolving trait. When stabilization of the tumor burden is possible, we expand the model into a Stackelberg evolutionary game, where the physician is the leader and the cancer cells are followers. The physician chooses a treatment dose to maximize an objective function that is a proxy of the patient's quality of life. In response, the cancer cells evolve a resistance level that maximizes their proliferation and survival. Assuming that cancer is in its ecological equilibrium, we compare the outcomes of three different treatment strategies: giving the maximum tolerable dose throughout, corresponding to the standard of care for most metastatic cancers, an ecologically enlightened therapy, where the physician anticipates the short-run, ecological response of cancer cells to their treatment, but not the evolution of resistance to treatment, and an evolutionarily enlightened therapy, where the physician anticipates both ecological and evolutionary consequences of the treatment. Of the three therapeutic strategies, the evolutionarily enlightened therapy leads to the highest values of the objective function, the lowest treatment dose, and the lowest treatment-induced resistance. Conversely, in our model, the maximum tolerable dose leads to the worst values of the objective function, the highest treatment dose, and the highest treatment-induced resistance.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Radiomics involves the extraction and analysis of numerous quantitative features of medical imaging which can add more information from radiological images often beyond initial comprehension of a clinician. Unlike deep learning, radiomics allows some understanding of identified quantitative features for clinical prediction. We sought to explore the current state of radiomics applications in the skull base literature. METHODS: A systematic review of studies evaluating radiomics in skull base was performed, including those with and without machine-learning approaches. Studies were summarized into thematic elements as well as specific pathologies. RESULTS: A total of 102 studies with 26,280 radiographic images were included. The earliest radiomic study was published in 2017 with exponential growth in research since then. Most studies focused on tumor diagnosis (40.8%), followed by tumor prognosis (31.1%), automated segmentation (16.5%), other applications (7.8%), and lastly prediction of intraoperative features (3.9%). Pituitary adenomas (41.7%) and vestibular schwannomas (18.4%) represented the most commonly evaluated pathologies; however, radiomics could be applied to a heterogeneous collection of skull base pathologies. The average study included 258 ± 677 cases (range 4; 6,755). CONCLUSION: Radiomics offers many functions in treating skull base pathology and will likely be an essential component of future clinical care. Larger sample sizes, validation of predictive models, and clinical application are needed. Further investigation into the strengths and weaknesses of radiomic applications in skull base treatments is warranted.",

However, due to cultural and linguistic differences, Chinese Australians encounter substantial barriers to accessing these services. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the barriers preventing Chinese Australians from accessing palliative care services. METHODS: Surveys and interviews were conducted with Chinese Australian cancer patients and their caregivers to assess their awareness, understanding, and challenges related to palliative care. RESULTS: Among 136 surveyed and eight interviewed participants, a significant lack of awareness and numerous misconceptions about palliative care were evident, with language as the primary barrier despite strong interest in such services. DISCUSSION: The results indicate a need to improve the awareness and accessibility of palliative care for the Chinese Australian community. Local health authorities and medical associations should collaborate in developing and disseminating culturally and linguistically appropriate information to increase service uptake among ethnic groups in Australia.",

    "AbstractText": "Biomarker enrichment clinical trial designs are versatile tools to assess the treatment effect and increase the efficiency of clinical trials. In this paper, we propose a two-stage enrichment clinical trial design with survival outcomes, and consider the situation where the biomarker assay and classification are possibly subject to errors. Specifically, the first stage is a randomized design, stratified by the biomarker appeared status. Depending on the result of the interim analysis and a pre-specified futility criterion, the second stage can be either enriched with only the biomarker appeared positive patients, or remain as the stratified design with both biomarker appeared positive and biomarker appeared negative patients. Compared to continuous and binary outcomes, test statistics to account for biomarker misclassification are much more complicated and require special care. We develop log-rank statistics for the interim and final analyses, with an adjustment for the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker assay. Control of Type I error rate is achieved by considering correlations between adjusted log-rank statistics from the same and/or different stages. R code is developed to calculate critical values, global/marginal power, and sample size. Our method is illustrated with examples of a recently successful development of immunotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "Our study aimed to analyze the correlation of cancer-related parameters with tumor regression grade (TRG) and disease-free survival (DFS) by gender in 192 rectal cancer patients operated on after neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT). Preoperative diagnostics revealed no significant gender differences in any clinical parameters other than obesity (p=0.031). We found that slightly overweight men had a lower incidence of distant metastases (p=0.042). The post-LCCRT pathologic finding showed that women had more positive lymph nodes (ypN, p=0.002) while no other pathologic parameter differed significantly between the genders. Overall, a poor response to therapy correlated with a shorter time to disease progression (p=0.002). Women achieved ypN0 in 50% of cases, but only 27% had a good TRG compared to 40.5% of men (p=0.073). Women had a worse DFS than men, even when complete response to therapy was achieved (p=0.003), and greater depth of residual tumor invasion (ypT, p=0.035) and higher ypN (p=0.002) correlated with shorter DFS. Positive resection margins (p<0.001), higher ypN stage (p=0.003), and poor TRG (p=0.025) correlated with shorter DFS in men. We conclude that women have a poorer response to LCCRT with the possibility that therapeutic approach to the neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer may be gender-specific.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. Tumor budding (TB), defined as isolated single cancer cells or small clusters of up to four cells at the invasive front, is an emerging histoprognostic factor associated with aggressiveness in various malignancies. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2 methods: manual on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. RESULTS: 25 patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods (p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age (>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. CONCLUSION: TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.",

We aimed to describe H. pylori treatment regimens in Portugal, within a real clinical practice setting. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of the Portuguese patients diagnosed with H. pylori between May 2013 and December 2022, within the European Registry on Helicobacter pylori Management (Hp-EuReg). The demographic and clinical data, diagnostic methods, treatment regimens, and prescription trends with their effectiveness were analysed by modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 700 cases, mainly from 2 centres (98% of cases), were included, with 59% females, with a mean age of 54 ± 15 years. Treatment-naïve patients encompassed 81% of cases. Overall compliance (>90% drug intake) was reported in 99% of cases. Overall effectiveness was 87%, by both mITT and PP analyses. The triple PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin therapy decreased from 29% in 2013 to 0% in 2022. Conversely, both quadruple concomitant PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin-metronidazole and PPI-bismuth-metronidazole-tetracycline therapies were predominantly used from 2016 onwards, with PPI-bismuth-metronidazole-tetracycline representing 76% of all prescriptions in 2022, achieving an overall mITT effectiveness of 92% and 91%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Portugal, concomitant quadruple therapy with PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin-metronidazole and bismuth quadruple with PPI-bismuth-metronidazole-tetracycline provided both optimal (>90%) effectiveness, in line with results of other Southern European countries.",

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 58-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C virus infection who presented with a voluminous shoulder HCC metastasis. Albeit an initial significant biochemical response with 1L sorafenib, progressive disease after 3 months plus a bleeding complication led to treatment discontinuation. Second-line nivolumab, although yielding a rapid clinical and biochemical response, was permanently ceased after 12 weeks due to a grade 3 immune-related hepatitis.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess disease burden and cost of illness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Portugal, assuming full adherence to the treatment algorithm associated to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. METHODS: An individual-level, continuous-time, state-transition model was used to simulate the progression of HCC patients through the BCLC disease stages. Health state transition rates were derived from the published literature. An expert panel provided further information on Portuguese epidemiology and clinical practice, including treatments and other healthcare resources utilization at each disease stage. Unit costs for health resources were collected from national public sources. HCC associated costs and outcomes were estimated over a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: Over the 5-year horizon of this study, the projections of HCC annual prevalence (including patients in remission) show an increasing trend, rising from 4,151 in 2023 to 4,851 in 2027. Despite the slight reduction in the predicted annual mortality rate (from 29.8% to 28.7%), we estimated that HCC could still lead to a total of 120,314 years of life lost due to premature mortality in the Portuguese population. Costs attributed to HCC were predicted to rise from around EUR 70 million in 2023 up to around EUR 77 million in 2027. Around 44.3% of these costs are related to HCC systemic treatment and 29.0% related to liver transplantation costs. CONCLUSION: HCC's increasing prevalence trend will continue to impose substantial disease burden in terms of premature mortality, with more than 20,000 years of life lost per year in the Portuguese population. Consequently, costs attributed to HCC are expected to rise despite the reduction on mortality by full adherence to the BCLC treatment algorithm. Continuing high disease burden and substantial cost of illness urge for a need of a comprehensive and effective healthcare interventions, as well as adequate resource allocation for HCC.",

Stroke is more frequent in underdeveloped countries, where ischemic stroke is one of the most common kinds. Therefore, it is imperative to unravel the processes of ischemic stroke in more depth and develop novel therapeutics to combat the condition. Polyphenols provide a significant preventive role against multiple diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, atherosclerosis, brain dysfunction, and stroke. METHODS: In the current investigation, computational tools including Swiss Target prediction, DisGeNET, SwissADME, pkCSM, Cytoscape, InterActiVenn, STRING database, and DAVID database were utilized to identify the signaling pathways, putative targets, along with associated genes of the polyphenols for stroke prevention. RESULTS: This study revealed the possible interactions between the disease targets for Stroke and the selected plant-based polyphenols. Docking results also exhibited the strong to moderate affinity of the selected ligands (Apigenin, Ellagic acid, Ferulic acid, Kaempferol, Genistein, Luteolin, Naringenin, and Quercetin) towards the selected disease target. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the neuroprotective role of selected polyphenols through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Further studies are required to investigate additional molecular mechanisms between the polyphenols and their derivatives against pathological targets of Stroke.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic may be considered as a shared source of uncertainty. Prolonged engagement with social media regarding this uncertainty could present as a risk factor for anxiety. We sought to investigate the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty, dimensions of resilience, uncertainty source (pandemic)-related social media use, and the risk of anxiety and depression in patients with cancer. METHOD: Patients with solid organ cancer (n=113) completed the sociodemographic data form, the Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) between May and August 2020. RESULTS: Depression scores were high at 17.7% of the patients while anxiety scores were high at 49.6%. RSA and its dimensions significantly differ between the Anxiety and Depression groups determined by the HADS. Time spent on social media about the COVID-19 pandemic (SMT) was associated with higher HADS-Anxiety scores (r=0.26, p<0.01), whereas higher resilience was associated with lower HADS- Anxiety (r=-0.42, p<0.01) and HADS-Depression (r=-0.52, p<0.01) scores. In addition to high levels of intolerance of uncertainty, low levels of the social resources were found to be a risk factor for depression, and low levels of self- and future-perception dimensions were found to be a risk factor for anxiety, regardless of the patients' social media use. CONCLUSION: As the factors that fuel uncertainty will always have an affect on cancer patients and cancer care, promoting the patients' resilience resources should be one of the main priorities for cancer patients.",

METHOD: Blood samples were taken from patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) who applied to Mersin Provincial Health Directorate Toros State Hospital Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment Center (AMATEM) between 01.09.2019-01.09.2020 and hepatitis virus markers, complete blood count and basic biochemistry were assessed. Sociodemographic Evaluation Form, Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Childhood Traumas Scale, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT), Temps-A Temperament Scale, Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale were applied to 107 patients with HCV and 101 patients without HCV who were selected by systematic sampling and the findings obtained were compared. RESULTS: Of the 1190 patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder, 340 (28.5%) were found to be HCV positive. 107 HCV-positive and 101 HCV- negative patients who were selected for comparison were similar in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. Among HCV positive patients, the rate of intravenous drug use and needle sharing were significantly higher (p<0.001, p<0.001). Overall duration of substance use and intravenous substance use were significantly higher in HCV positive patients (p=0.024 and p=0.017). Similarly, HCV positive group were significantly more likely (p<0.001) to have heard of HCV before and significantly more likely (p=0.009) to know that HCV causes cirrhosis and liver cancer. Regarding the scores of Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Childhood Traumas Scale, Substance Use Disorder Recognition Test, DUDIT, Temps -A Temperament Scales applied to HCV positive and HCV negative patients with Opioid Use Disorder, no difference was found. The scores of the 'Non-Acceptance' factor of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale were found to be significantly higher in HCV positive patients with Opioid Use Disorder (p=0.020). CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) have higher rates of HCV positivity compared to general public. Intravenous drug use significantly increases this risk. Half of HCV-positive patients were unaware that they have the virus and only a very small proportion received treatment. Therefore, examining each patient with OUD for HCV, treating positive patients in an effective referral system seems to be the an important step in the eradication of this disease in this population.",

There is no definitive method for intraoperative diagnosis of this complication. METHOD: We studied on CND indicated 17 thyroid cancer patients (14 female, 3 male, age range: 21-67, mean age: 43.4). The excised CND material was kept in 50 ml of normal saline for 30 minutes. A 2 ml sample was taken from this fluid and sent to biochemistry for rapid parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement. RESULTS: PTH values were <10pg/mL in 14 patients. PTH values of three patients were very high (112pg/mL, 167pg/mL, 210pg/mL respectively). When the excised tissue in these patients was evaluated intraoperatively with loop glasses, one parathyroid tissue was found in each of the three cases and these were autotransplanted intramuscularly. After this procedure we kept CND tissue material again in another normal saline of 50mL in 30 minutes and PTH was measured. The values came back as <10pg/mL. No parathyroid gland was found in any case in the postoperative routine histopathological evaluation. No patient had symptoms of hypocalcemia during the eight-weeks postoperative follow-up.

    "AbstractText": "Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) generally has an excellent prognosis, yet treatment strategies have traditionally been aggressive, often involving total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation and long-term suppressive levothyroxine therapy even in cases considered to be low- or intermediate-risk. In recent years, several guidelines have recommended a more individualized, risk-based approach aiming for a more conservative treatment plan. Despite this paradigm shift, there is a gap between recommendations and actual clinical practice as many centers continue to advocate the more aggressive treatment model. De-escalating the care of selected patients with thyroid cancer include the avoidance of surgery in tumours < 10 mm, the recommendation for thyroid lobectomy for tumours < 4cm, the avoidance of prophylactic lymph node dissection. Evidence based studies show that such strategies do not worsen long-term outcomes, can reduce complications and can lead to better quality of life.

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the U.S., which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood haematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukaemia and lymphoma.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study used chest radiographs from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial in the United States between November 1993 and July 2001 with pathological cancer diagnosis follow-up to 2009 (median 11.3 years). The software's predictions were compared to the PLCO radiologists' reads. A reader study was performed with a subset comparing the software to 3 experienced radiologists. RESULTS: The analysis included 24 370 individuals (mean age 62.6 ± 5.4; median age 62; cancer rate 2%), with 213 individuals (mean age 63.6 ± 5.5; median age 63; cancer rate 46%) for the reader study. AI achieved higher specificity (0.910 for AI vs. 0.803 for radiologists, P < .001), positive predictive value (0.054 for AI vs. 0.032 for radiologists, P < .001), but lower sensitivity (0.326 for AI vs. 0.412 for radiologists, P = .001) than the PLCO radiologists. When we calibrated the sensitivity of AI to match it with the PLCO radiologists, AI had higher specificity (0.815 for AI vs. 0.803 for radiologists, P < .001). In the reader study, AI achieved higher sensitivity than readers 1 and 3 (0.608 for AI vs. 0.588 for reader 1, P = .789 vs. 0.588 for reader 3, P = .803) but lower specificity than reader 1 (0.888 for AI vs. 0.905 for reader 1, P = .814). Compared to reader 2, AI showed higher specificity (0.888 for AI vs. 0.819 for reader 2, P = .153) but lower sensitivity (0.888 for AI vs. 0.905 for reader 1, P = .814). CONCLUSION: AI detects lung cancer on chest radiographs among asymptomatic individuals with comparable performance to experienced radiologists.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A Prospective Study to Evaluate the Association of Sensory Dysregulation and Adverse Pathologic Features in Oral Tongue Cancers.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: To correlate sensory dysfunction with adverse pathologic factors for tongue cancers and determine the survival prognosticators. METHODS: We prospectively collected data on the pain sensation (Brief Pain Inventory), gustation (NIH Taste Intensity Test), proprioception (Two-point and light touch discrimination) from patients with squamous carcinoma of oral tongue, surgically treated between July 2021 and September 2022, and stratified them based on pT stage. The pathologist was blinded to the clinical data and correlation with the sensory dysregulations was obtained using a multivariate analysis. Factors predicting overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 100 patients were followed up with a median of 13 months. Radiating pain predicted advanced disease, extranodal extension (ENE) and perineural invasion (PNI). Loss of sweet and salty taste were associated with advanced disease, Depapillation and PNI. Among early tumors, 26% had taste alterations, with loss of sweet taste significantly associated with Depapillation and PNI. Loss of light touch was significantly associated with presence of PNI, while loss of two-point discrimination was associated with larger tumors, PNI and poor grade. The OS was significantly reduced when pain scores were moderate to severe at their least within 24 h from interview and loss of light touch. CONCLUSION: Radiating pain, sweet and salty taste dysregulation and loss of sensory discrimination have a strong correlation with PNI and impact survival.",

    "ArticleTitle": "External Validation of Straticyte™, a Quantitative Biomarker-Based Risk Assay in Predicting Oral Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Current management of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) based on dysplasia grading is controversial. The malignant transformation rate of OPMDs does not correlate well with dysplasia grading, resulting in non-standardized treatment for patients. A quantitative biomarker-based risk score (qBRS; trade name StraticyteTM) was previously developed to address shortcomings related to the current standard of care. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study consisting of biopsied OPMDs was used to validate qBRS for predicting transformation of OPMDs to OSCC. MATERIALS & METHODS: Three hundred and two cases were immunostained, imaged, and analyzed via qBRS. A binary prognostic risk was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve optimizing sensitivity and specificity. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the cumulative probability of lack of malignant transformation for patients with elevated or normal biomarker-based risk. RESULTS: The results demonstrated very high sensitivity (96.2%) and negative predictive value (96.2%) for qBRS. Elevated risk scores had higher predicted probabilities of transformation to cancer, independent of dysplasia grade. CONCLUSIONS: qBRS can be a useful clinical adjunct tool to dysplasia grading for the assessment of malignant transformation potential, providing a quantitative metric in OPMDs. The addition of qBRS to current histological techniques should improve early detection rates of OSCC, enhancing the effectiveness of treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are two main groups of drugs for targeted treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Inhibition of angiogenesis and other growth pathways that are pivotal for tumor progression lead to significant improvement of survival in patients with mRCC. The main aim of this study was to compare the effects of temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and interferon alpha-2a (IFN-alpha-2a) on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with T3 stage mRCC who developed lung metastasis in the first two years after radical nephrectomy. A total of 60 patients diagnosed with T3 stage renal cancer who developed metastases in the lungs within two years after radical nephrectomy were included in a prospective study conducted at the Department for Urology, Clinical Center of Vojvodina and partially retrospective study at the Oncology Institute in Sremska Kamenica. Patients were divided into two groups consisting of 30 patients according to treatment with temsirolimus or IFN-alpha. During the first year of treatment, OS of patients treated with temsirolimus was 23.33%, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 16.67%. Median survival in patients treated with temsirolimus was 9.3 months, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 6.9 months, yielding a statistically significant difference (p=0.028). Patients treated with temsirolimus showed a statistically significantly longer median PFS compared to patients treated with IFN-alpha (p<0.0085). In conclusion, temsirolimus therapy had a significantly positive effect on survival in patients with mRCC. Patients treated with temsirolimus showed significantly longer median survival and median PFS compared to patients treated with IFN-alpha.",

This study aimed to examine the correlation between CD86 and CD163 macrophage expression and clinical-pathological characteristics of the disease in patients operated on for pancreatic carcinoma. A retrospective research was conducted in which the archival materials of the Ljudevit Jurak Department of Pathology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center were used together with all relevant patient clinical data obtained from the Hospital Information System on 76 patients operated on for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In our study, the number of CD86 macrophages and the CD86/CD163 ratio showed a statistically significant correlation with increasing T and N stages of the disease. The number of CD163 macrophages did not show a statistically significant correlation with the mentioned variables. These results indicated that in our clinical conditions, proinflammatory (M1) macrophages were more expressed in locally advanced tumor stages with worse long-term prognoses. In conclusion, TAMs could be a valid prognostic marker or even a target for therapeutic agents but more studies will be needed to fully comprehend the impact of M1/M2 differentiation.",

Tumor invasion of CA is assessed by using computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. Ultrasound was also used but the method has not become daily routine. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tumor invasion on CA dynamics and to evaluate the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of invasion. The study was conducted on two groups of 22 patients each. The first group consisted of patients with confirmed HNC and CA infiltration, while the second group consisted of patients without any data of HNC. Motion of the CA wall was assessed using ultrasound from which a CA was segmented and then the amount of motion was assessed by optical flow calculation. All patients with a CT-verified CA infiltration had an altered CA motion. The research showed that tumor-infiltrated CA had an altered dynamic when viewed on ultrasound.",

    "AbstractText": "Stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major therapeutic challenge because it is not easy to decide whether patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or not. This study was designed as a retrospective prognostic study combining standard histopathologic parameters with tumor budding and microsatellite instability. The study included 89 patients on elective treatment for stage II primary colorectal adenocarcinoma from January 2011 to December 2015. Study results indicated that the prognosis of patients with stage II CRC depended on the combination of three factors, (in the order of importance): number of lymph nodes examined; total number of buds per 0.785 mm2 (≥5.5); and positive lymphovascular invasion. There is increasing evidence that tumor biology and non-anatomic characteristics are important in the prognosis and treatment of CRC. One of them is tumor budding which is not yet an integral part of the AJCC staging system. A low number of the lymph nodes examined is associated with high-risk patients. All patients without an adequate number of lymph nodes examined (less than 8 lymph nodes) should a priori be considered a very high-risk group, with a very low survival rate, and chemotherapy should be used.",

We compared ERUS findings with postoperative pathological data in 41 patients with endoscopic and pathological (PH) diagnosis of rectal cancer. These patients underwent ERUS examination to determine the extent of the disease and the findings were subsequently compared with postoperative pathological diagnosis. After ERUS examination, there were three patients in group T0, five in group T1, 12 in group T2, 17 in group T3, two in group T4, and two patients had a mucinous metastatic type of cancer. After excluding 15 patients who met the exclusion criteria, we compared ERUS findings of 26 patients with their pathological diagnosis to determine the sensitivity and accuracy of ERUS. The total sensitivity of the ERUS in preoperative staging of the tumor stage T0-T4 was 96%. Accuracy was 89%. This study showed that a surgeon can rely on the findings of ERUS performed by an experienced endoscopist before deciding of type of surgical procedure for T0-T2, and even T3 degree of rectal cancer. T3 rectal cancers are in the \"gray zone\", so both procedures, ERUS and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR), are needed to decide on the final therapeutic approach.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed and Embase databases to identify related English-language studies published within the last 10 years. Key search words included \"upper urinary tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma\", \"kidney-sparing surgery or approach\", \"endoscopic treatment for upper tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma\", \"topical instillation in the upper urinary tract\", and \"urinary marker for urothelial carcinoma\". References within the identified literature were explored and evaluated for relevance. RESULTS: KSS is recommended for both low-risk and selected high-risk UTUC with imperative indications such as solitary kidney. Studies have shown comparable oncological outcomes after KSS including endoscopic ablation, segmental ureterectomy, and topical instillation of novel agents when compared to radical nephroureterectomy in well-selected cases. The development of novel diagnostic tools and risk-stratifying models allows optimal case selection for KSS without compromising oncological outcomes. CONCLUSION: Kidney-sparing approach for UTUC is an evolving and promising area in urologic oncology, driven by advances in technology, better diagnostic tools, and novel therapeutic agents. Our article provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements and clinical recommendations.

METHODS: Literature search was made using PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Wiley Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival rate, which was addressed by a systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. RESULTS: The evidence is consistent in showing that 5-year survival of trimodality therapy is similar to radical cystectomy in selected patients, ranging between 29% and 73%. Patients undergoing bladder-sparing therapy were found to have better outcomes in terms of quality of life and sociability than those undergoing radical cystectomy. Immunotherapy is establishing itself as a strategy for organ-preservation treatment, showing complete response rates between 42% and 100%. However, most of these results have been obtained from ongoing clinical trials. Furthermore, there are still no studies comparing the efficacy among the different available therapies. CONCLUSION: Although radical cystectomy remains the gold standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, its significant morbidity has prompted the exploration of alternative therapies. In this context, bladder preservation therapies, though supported by limited literature, emerge as a potential alternative that could offer comparable oncological outcomes in selected patients.",

METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2022, cT2cN0M0 PCa patients who underwent prostate biopsies and subsequent RARP at the Peking University First Hospital with an interval between biopsy and RARP of ≤90 days were included. Univariable and stepwise multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors associated with APCs. Nomograms were constructed based on these predictive models. The performance of the nomograms was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analyses, and calibration plots. RESULTS: A total of 423 eligible cT2cN0M0 PCa patients were included. The rates of upgrading, upstaging, and PSM in our cohort were 33%, 51%, and 35%, respectively. The stepwise multivariate logistic analysis suggested that PSA density and the percentage of positive cores in systematic biopsy were significantly associated with the occurrence of APCs. The score of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, PSA density, and the International Society of Urological Pathology grade group (IGG) of needle-biopsy specimens (or clinical IGG [cIGG]) were significantly associated with upgrading. The PSA density, percentage of positive cores in systematic biopsy, and largest tumor percentage in all cores of each patient (LTP) were significantly associated with upstaging. The PSA density and LTP were significantly associated with the PSM. Based on these results, four nomograms were developed. Receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analyses, and calibration plots implied that the nomograms exhibited excellent accuracy. CONCLUSION: The predictive models we developed could help to identify high-risk PCa early, and optimize clinical decisions of cT2cN0M0 PCa patients.",

Key biomarkers like Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) are expressed in both healthy and malignant prostate cells. This study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between pathological characteristics, survival, recurrence, and tissue expression of EZH2 and FOXM1 in high-risk PCa patients. METHODS: PCa tissues were used in a retrospective analysis that spanned from September 2009 to August 2019. Inclusion criteria comprised pathological tumor stage (pT) 3 patients with positive surgical margins or tumor proximity to inked margins within 5 mm. After case selection, tissue slides were stained for EZH2 and FOXM1 antibodies, and Allred scores were calculated. Patients or relatives of deceased patients were contacted for signed agreements and disease follow-ups. RESULTS: The pT3b, ductal carcinoma component, and moderate EZH2 expression were associated with relapse (odds ratio [OR] 6.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-27.27, p=0.016; OR 7.29, 95% CI 1.03-51.43, p=0.046; OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.09-32.48, p=0.039; respectively). The unilateral and bilateral seminal vesicle invasion increased the likelihood of recurrence by 9.98 times and 5.36 times, and the risk of death by around 9.78 times and 10.79 times, respectively. The pT3b was linked to higher death likelihood (OR 7.16, 95% CI 1.38-37.23, p=0.019), while moderate EZH2 expression did not show statistical significance (OR 4.54, 95% CI 0.87-23.60, p=0.072, marginally). Pathological regional lymph node stage (pN) 1 had significantly higher probability of mortality than pN unknown (3.9% vs. 27%, p<0.001). PCa in the neck and apex of the prostate gland increased death risk tenfold. CONCLUSION: Sufficient immunoexpression of EZH2, ductal carcinoma component, and neoplastic proliferation in the seminal vesicles, apex and neck of the prostate gland correlates with elevated risks of recurrence and mortality.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Diagnostic interval/delay (DI) denotes the duration between first presentations to healthcare provider to the definitive diagnosis of cancer. Prolonged DI is a major contributor to deaths among children with malignancies in low-middle-income countries (LMICs). The data on DI and factors affecting it are limited from LMIC. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients/children<12 years with proven/suspected malignancies. Children already on definitive chemotherapy, who died before a definitive diagnosis and with benign tumours were excluded. The parents or caregivers were interviewed individually using a customized questionnaire. Various intervals in referral chain like patient interval/delay (PI), DI and treatment interval/delay (TI) and factors affecting DI were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 120 eligible children; 79 with median age 43 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-81) were analyzed. Haematological malignancies (n = 40) and non-haematological malignancies (n = 39) were equally distributed. Median total delay was 74 days (14-88 days). Median DI was 17 days (IQR: 8-54). The main contributor to delay was due to referral delay by primary and secondary physician (p < 0.05). The median PI was 2 day (IQR: 0-7.5) and median TI was 1 day (IQR: 0-4). Prolonged DI (DI > 30 days) was seen in 33 (41.8%) children. Trial of alternative medicine was the only significant factor associated with prolonged DI in univariate and multivariate analysis with odds ratio of 6.24. Other demographic, socioeconomic, health-seeking journey and disease-related factors were not found to be associated with prolonged DI.

METHODS: A 54-year-old patient was referred to the eye clinic at the Rassoul Akram Hospital in 2016 due to complaints of blurry vision. In addition to UM, he later developed retinal capillary hemangioblastomas in his eye and a central nervous system hemangioblastoma. Proband had a family history of prostate cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. After analyzing the Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the VHL genes, no mutations were found, leading to the decision to perform WES. RESULTS: WES disclosed a heterozygous known pathogenic nonsense variant: c.274C>T (p.Arg92*) in exon 3 of gene FCGR1A. CONCLUSIONS: Our examination indicated that FCGR1A: c.274C>T (p.Arg92*) may have contributed to the co-occurrence of UM and VHL disease. In the future, FCGR1A could be a promising therapeutic approach for retinal cancer due to its role in several cancers and retinal degeneration.

    "AbstractText": "Tyrosine phosphorylations are a prominent characteristic of numerous cancers, necessitating the use of computational tools to comprehensively analyze phosphoproteomes and identify potentially (dys)functional phosphorylations. Here we propose a machine learning-based method to predict the thermodynamic stability change resulting from tyrosine phosphorylation. Our approach, based on prediction of phosphomimetic delta-delta-G from structural features, strongly correlates with experimental mutational scanning cDNA proteolysis data (R = 0.71). We predicted the destabilizing effects of all 384,857 tyrosine residues from the Alphafold2 database. We then applied our approach to a pan-cancer phosphoproteomics dataset, comprising over 600 unique tyrosine phosphorylations across 11 cancer subtypes. We predict destabilizing phosphorylations in both oncogenes and tumor suppressors, where the former likely reflects a generalized relief of auto-inhibition or activating conformational change. We find that the number of circuit topological parallel relations with respect to residues contacting the phosphorylated site is greater for autoinhibited oncogenes than for other proteins (Wilcoxon p = 0.03). Utilizing an extreme gradient-boosting machine learning approach, we obtain an AUC of 0.85 for the prediction of autoinhibited phosphorylation states from circuit topological features. The top destabilized proteins from the pan-cancer data are enriched for chemical and oxidative stress pathways. Among metabolic proteins, highly destabilizing phosphorylations tend to occur in more peripheral proteins with lower network centrality measures (Wilcoxon p = 0.005). We predict 58% of recurrent tyrosine cancer phosphorylations to be destabilizing at the 1 kcal/mol threshold. Our approach can enable rapid screening of destabilizing phosphorylations and phosphomimetic mutations.",

To test this, we combined cancer genomic analysis with extensive molecular dynamics simulations of mTOR oncogenic variants. We observed that conformational changes within mTOR kinase domain are associated with multiple mutational activation events. The mutations disturb the α-packing formed by the kαAL, kα3, kα9, kα9b, and kα10 helices in the kinase domain creating cryptic pocket. Its opening correlates with opening of the catalytic cleft, including active site residues realignment, favoring catalysis. The cryptic pocket created by disrupted α-packing coincides with the allosteric pocket in PI3Kα can be harmoniously fitted by the PI3Kα allosteric inhibitor RLY-2608, suggesting that analogous drugs designed based on RLY-2608 can restore the packed α-structure, resulting in mTOR inactive conformation.

However, respect for patient autonomy remains a fundamental ethical principle, as outlined in codes of conduct and patient rights within healthcare services. The aim of this case presentation was to critically analyze a clinical ethics case within the Iranian context using an ethical framework. A theory-based framework was used that integrates the principlism approach, based on prima facie moral norms, with the moral development theories of Lawrence Kohlberg and James Rest to analyze this case. Mrs. M, a 38-year-old pregnant woman with acute myeloid leukemia, chose to continue her pregnancy until 32 weeks, despite medical advice, before starting her cancer treatment.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Minimally Invasive Surgery for the Management of Ovarian Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To examine perioperative and survival outcomes of patients with ovarian cancer managed by minimally invasive surgery compared with laparotomy in the context of 1) early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, 2) primary cytoreduction for advanced disease, and 3) interval debulking after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted PubMed, MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and meeting abstract libraries (International Gynecological Cancer Society, Society of Gynecologic Oncology, American Society of Clinical Oncology) from 1994, the year of the first published laparoscopic clinical study in ovarian cancer, to May 2024. Studies that compared minimally invasive surgery with laparotomy for staging of ovarian cancer and reported perioperative or survival outcomes data were included. Single-arm studies, case studies, meeting abstracts, and studies involving borderline tumors, fertility-sparing surgery, or management of recurrent disease were excluded. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Three authors independently screened citations for relevance and inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessed the risk of bias of individual studies using the methodologic index for nonrandomized studies criteria for nonrandomized studies. TABULTATION INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: From a total of 2,777 identified citations, 36 nonrandomized studies were included: 21 early-stage, five primary debulking for advanced stages, seven interval debulking after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and three with heterogeneous populations. No randomized studies were identified. For early-stage cancer, nine studies found no difference in progression-free survival (risk ratio [RR] 1.05, 95% CI, 1.00-1.10, I 2=34.7%, P=.151), and 12 studies found no difference in overall survival (RR 1.00, 95% CI, 0.98-1.03, I 2=49.7%, P=.025). For primary debulking of advanced disease, rate of optimal debulking (five studies) (RR 1.11, 95% CI, 1.00-1.25, I 2=41.5%, P=.144) slightly favored minimally invasive techniques. For interval debulking, there was no difference in rates of optimal debulking (five studies) (RR 1.03, 95% CI, 0.96-1.11, I 2=54.6%, P<.051) between the two surgical modalities. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of observational studies in this analysis with a fair amount of bias warrants caution in the interpretation of the findings. However, minimally invasive surgery may offer some perioperative advantages over laparotomy and may be an acceptable alternative for selected patients. For early-stage disease, there was no difference in survival outcomes between minimally invasive surgery and laparotomy. For those with advanced disease, rates of optimal debulking were similar.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the proportion of patients with documentation of meeting cervical cancer screening exit criteria in the medical record and to estimate the incidence of cancer and high-grade precancerous lesions after age 65 years detected by the end of the study period, by screening exit eligibility. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who turned 66 years old between 2010 and 2019 at two large health care systems located in Dallas, Texas, and Boston, Massachusetts, from the METRICS (MultilEvel opTimization of the ceRvIcal Cancer Screening process in diverse Settings & populations) Research Center, part of the PROSPR II (Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process) consortium. The primary outcomes were 1) the percentage of patients who were eligible for screening exit at age 66 years after adequate documented negative screening history (at least three consecutive negative cytology test results or two consecutive negative human papillomavirus [HPV] test or co-test results [cytology+HPV testing] within the prior 10 years) and 2) the worst pathology or cytology outcome documented in the cohort after age 65 years. RESULTS: Among 42,393 people who turned 66 years old while in the METRICS cohort, approximately 75.7% (n=32,094) were not eligible to exit screening at age 66 years, primarily because too few screening tests were documented (n=29,354, 91.5% of those ineligible). Furthermore, only 4,037 patients at both sites had 10 years of prior observation within the health care system, meaning data from current and prior health care delivery sites would be needed to assess exit eligibility for more than 90% of the cohort. Patients remained in the cohort after their 66th birthday on average for 3.8 years (interquartile range 2.0-6.5 years), and most (79.3%) had no subsequent evaluation after their 66th birthday. Among those ineligible to exit due to insufficient screening history, 83.7% were not subsequently screened. Of the 16.3% who were screened, 90 (1.9%) were diagnosed with cancer or high-grade precancerous lesions, including 34 (0.7%) who were diagnosed with cervical cancer. By contrast, among patients eligible to exit with sufficient screening history, 34.3% had at least one subsequent cytology or pathology result or both, and high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer were diagnosed in only 0.6% (n=16). CONCLUSION: Data documented in the medical record are often insufficient to meet guidelines for exiting cervical cancer screening.",

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does racialized economic segregation play a role in NSCLC treatment and outcomes and contribute to racial disparities? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients with NSCLC diagnosed between 2007 and 2015 and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. County-level racialized economic segregation was estimated using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE). Multilevel logistic regression and multilevel Cox regression accounting for county-level clustering were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for late-stage diagnosis and treatment underutilization, and hazard ratio (HR) for mortality. RESULTS: Of 203,441 patients, 85.8% were NHW and 14.2% were NHB. Compared with patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of high-income NHW households (lowest ICE quintile), patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of low-income NHB households (highest ICE quintile) had higher risks of late-stage diagnosis (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16; P trend <.001), underutilization of guideline-recommended treatment (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.16-1.41; P trend <.0001), lung cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.07-1.14; P trend <.0001), and overall mortality (HR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.09-1.16; P trend <.0001). The association between segregation and treatment underutilization was stronger in NHW than NHB patients (Pinteraction =0.02). There was no significant difference in the segregation-related risk of late-stage diagnosis, lung cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality between NHW and NHB patients. INTERPRETATION: Living in segregated, low-income NHB counties had adverse impacts on early detection, treatment, and outcomes of NSCLC. However, residential segregation did not explain the excess risks of NSCLC care underutilization and mortality in NHB patients compared with NHW patients.",

    "AbstractText": "As the number of Asian cancer survivors continues to increase, there is a growing need for interventions to address their physiological and psychosocial needs. The aim of our systematic review was to assess the types and the impact of psychosocial or behavioral interventions for cancer survivorship among Asian Americans and Asian immigrants globally. The review included 18 articles reporting data from eight interventions, of which five were randomized controlled trials and three were one-group design interventions. All interventions were conducted with Asian Americans and fell into three categories: (a) expressive writing interventions that facilitated individual cognitive and emotional processing, (b) educational and social support interventions, and (c) healthy lifestyle interventions. Expressive writing studies that involved writing tasks facilitating emotional and stress disclosure and cognitive reappraisal were most beneficial for Chinese American survivors, and both in-person and longer virtual educational and social support interventions yielded improvements for survivors. The healthy lifestyle intervention was more beneficial for the mental health than the physical health of survivors. The small number of interventions in the United States and the lack of interventions with Asian immigrants outside of the United States highlights the need for more survivorship interventions for Asian cancer survivors. Successful cultural adaptation of cancer survivorship interventions often required multiple studies and extensive time and resources. The early success of culturally adapted interventions shows the path forward in developing effective survivorship interventions for Asian Americans and for testing and disseminating interventions among various cancer types and Asian subgroups in future research.",

    "AbstractText": "Translocations are rearrangements produced upon erroneous repair of double-strand breaks, fusing segments of non-homologous chromosomes. These events can cause chimeric protein expression and other transcriptional alterations, eventually driving oncogenic transformation. Despite their significance, the factors shaping the heterogeneous translocation landscape in healthy individuals and cancer patients remain incompletely understood. In this review, we focus on genomic content and activation as two fundamental factors associated with translocation formation and selection. While emphasizing the critical role of double-strand breaks and interchromosomal contacts in translocation formation, we discuss that selective advantage is likely the main driver shaping translocation landscapes in health and disease. Finally, we address that it remains difficult to disentangle the effect of translocation formation from the influence of selective pressure, and point out that unraveling their separate contribution in future studies will be key to better understand early tumorigenesis.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Impact of skin tone on target size detectability in photoacoustic breast imaging.",
    "AbstractText": "SIGNIFICANCE: Photoacoustic imaging has the potential to improve non-invasive breast cancer diagnosis. However, illumination through the skin introduces a skin tone bias, as greater melanin content increases optical absorption and can create acoustic clutter, reducing the visibility of various target sizes. AIM: We investigate the impact of skin tone bias as a function of target sizes in three photoacoustic image reconstruction methods: fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based reconstruction, delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, and short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) beamforming. METHODS: The three imaging methods were applied to channel data from multidomain simulations with 757, 800, and 1064 nm wavelengths, 11 target sizes (ranging 0.5 to 3 mm), 18 skin tones [ranging individual typology angles (ITAs) of -54 deg to 60 deg], and a previously validated realistic 3D breast model. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) were measured to assess visibility. RESULTS: With 757 and 800 nm wavelengths, targets underlying dark skin tones (ITA range: -54 deg to -33 deg) with sizes ≤3 mm were poorly visible with ≤2.38 to 4.21 mean SNR and ≤0.46 to 0.74 mean gCNR, with smaller targets generally being more visible with lighter skin tones. A 1064-nm transmit wavelength improved visualization with DAS and SLSC beamforming, relative to both FFT reconstruction with a 1064 nm wavelength and DAS or SLSC beamforming with 757 and 800 nm wavelengths. When combined with SLSC beamforming, the 1064-nm wavelength offered the greatest improvements, enabling visualization of simulated target sizes ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm underlying very light (ITA = 60 deg) to dark (ITA = -54 deg) skin tones, with mean SNR ≤10.01 and mean gCNR ≤1. Visualization of simulated vessel structures derived from in vivo photoacoustic images was consistent with simulation-based target size expectations. CONCLUSIONS: Results are promising for advancing next-generation photoacoustic imaging systems for breast cancer diagnosis across the range of skin tones represented in healthcare systems throughout the world.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Antiresorptive drugs are commonly used to treat cancer and bone metastases. These drugs can impose the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). ONJ is a serious complication that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and preventive measures utilization of ONJ among cancer patients treated with antiresorptive agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study investigated 210 adult patients with cancer on either zoledronic acid (ZA) or denosumab at a tertiary cancer center. The primary endpoint was to determine the incidence rate of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw. Secondary endpoints were to determine the utilization rate of antiresorptive agent related ONJ preventive measures and the exposure duration of antiresorptive agents to the ONJ incidence. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 68 were on zoledronic acid (group 1) and 142 were maintained on denosumab (group 2). The median incidence rate of medication related ONJ (MRONJ) was 3.8 % (8 out of 210), with 4.4 % (3 out of 68) in the first group and 3.5 % (5 out of 142) in the second group. All ONJ cases were females with metastatic breast cancer to bone. The utilization rate of ONJ preventive measures was 5.2 %, including regular dental check-ups (3.3 %) and oral hygiene education (1.9 %). The median duration of exposure before ONJ was 1 year for zoledronic acid and 2 years for denosumab. Risk factors included female sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Duration of Denosumab exposure, but not ZA, was associated with incidence of ONJ. CONCLUSION: Higher incidence rate of ONJ among denosumab-treated group. The findings emphasize the importance of female sex, diabetes, and hypertension as significant risk factors. The use of preventive measures was found to be low, indicating a need for better education and awareness.",

    "ArticleTitle": "DGR-MIL: Exploring Diverse Global Representation in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification.",
    "AbstractText": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) stands as a powerful approach in weakly supervised learning, regularly employed in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification for detecting tumorous lesions. However, existing mainstream MIL methods focus on modeling correlation between instances while overlooking the inherent diversity among instances. However, few MIL methods have aimed at diversity modeling, which empirically show inferior performance but with a high computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel MIL aggregation method based on diverse global representation (DGR-MIL), by modeling diversity among instances through a set of global vectors that serve as a summary of all instances. First, we turn the instance correlation into the similarity between instance embeddings and the predefined global vectors through a cross-attention mechanism. This stems from the fact that similar instance embeddings typically would result in a higher correlation with a certain global vector. Second, we propose two mechanisms to enforce the diversity among the global vectors to be more descriptive of the entire bag: (i) positive instance alignment and (ii) a novel, efficient, and theoretically guaranteed diversification learning paradigm. Specifically, the positive instance alignment module encourages the global vectors to align with the center of positive instances (e.g., instances containing tumors in WSI). To further diversify the global representations, we propose a novel diversification learning paradigm leveraging the determinantal point process. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL aggregation models by a substantial margin on the CAMELYON-16 and the TCGA-lung cancer datasets.

This study offers a comprehensive analysis of patients undergoing three-port minimally invasive transthoracic esophagectomy with comprehensive mediastinal lymphadenectomy (3P-MIE) in the prone position, focusing on surgical technique, morbidity, mortality, histological findings, and survival outcomes. Data from 176 patients who underwent 3P-MIE for resectable esophageal cancer in the prone position from January 2010 to March 2023 were analyzed. Most patients underwent a two-field lymphadenectomy (n = 173), while three patients had three-field nodal dissection. Thoracic component was performed thoracoscopically, while abdominal component through laparoscopy or mini laparotomy. Cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed in all patients using a semi-mechanical technique. The demographic data showed a median age of 52 years (range 21-73), with 99 females and 77 males. The predominant histology was squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (86%). Twenty-seven patients underwent upfront surgery (15%), neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACRT) was delivered to 135 cases (77%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in 11 (7%), and salvage surgery in 3 (2%). Surgical details revealed a median operative time of 370 min (range 90-580) and a median blood loss of 175 mL (range 50-2000 mL). Forty-nine percent (n = 87) of the patients experienced complications of grade 2 or greater according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 14.7% of cases, and pneumonia in 17.6%. The median ICU stay was 4 days (range 2-22), and median hospital stay of 9 days (range 5-38). Thirty-day mortality was observed in 5% (n = 9), and 90-day mortality in 6.25% (n = 11). A median of 20 nodes were retrieved, with R0 resection achieved in 96.6% of cases.

We sought to estimate the ability of this metric to predict major postoperative complications in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing the Whipple procedure. This is a prospective, observational, single-centre study involving adult patients undergoing the Whipple procedure, at a major tertiary cancer centre. All eligible patients undergoing Whipple surgery in our institute between March 2018 and October 2021 were included in the study. Demographic data, clinicopathological characteristics, comorbidities, intraoperative variables, and postoperative complications were analyzed. The surgical score was calculated from intraoperative blood loss, lowest heart rate, and lowest mean arterial pressure. All the patients were followed up till 30 days postoperatively. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate analyses were used as appropriate. The occurrence of major postoperative complications represented the primary outcome. A total of 253 patients were analyzed. The mean duration of surgery was 436 min. On statistical analyses, the occurrence of major postoperative complications was significantly associated with SAS ≤ 4 (OR = 8.00, 95% CI = 3.78-16.93, p = 0.000), use of intraoperative vasopressor (OR = 2.247, 95% CI = 1.312-3.846, p = 0.003), and body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.074, 95% CI = 1.010-1.142, p = 0.022). However, we did not find any significant association between other demographic variables like age, comorbidities, duration of surgery, and preoperative s. albumin with the occurrence of postoperative complications. Lower SAS (≤ 4) is the most powerful predictor of postoperative complications in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing Whipple surgery.

But, in the Eastern population, the tumor often originates in the antropyloric region resulting in comparatively early occurrence of GOO. The management of such resectable cases is not clearly defined in literature. In this study, we analyzed the surgical outcome and survival of upfront D2 gastrectomy combined with adjuvant chemotherapy in these cases. METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive patients with carcinoma stomach accompanied by GOO from April 2018 to March 2022. The feasibility of radical surgery, clinicopathological profile, and factors affecting postoperative morbidity were analyzed. Two-year overall survival (OS) and associated factors were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Among 119 gastric carcinoma patients, 78 presented with GOO. After excluding metastatic disease (18), locally unresectable disease (5), and neo-adjuvant therapy (3), 52 patients underwent radical gastrectomy. Post-operative morbidity and 90-day mortality were 32.7% and 0%, respectively. Factors affecting morbidity were low hemoglobin levels (p = 0.024) and type of procedure (subtotal vs. total gastrectomy) (p = 0.04). A total of 78.8% patients completed fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The 2-year OS was 59.3% and non-completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.68, p = 0.038) and poor tumor differentiation (HR 2.77, p = 0.015) were linked to worse OS. CONCLUSION: Upfront radical surgery in resectable carcinoma stomach with GOO is a feasible treatment option with acceptable good surgical and oncological outcomes. With combined adjuvant chemotherapy, a reasonable survival rate is observed.",

After a median follow-up of 50 months, 101 recurrences (50.75%) were detected among 199 curative resections. Recurrences were categorized into nonperitoneal distant (40.6%), peritoneal (28.7%), locoregional (22.8%), and mixed type (7.9%). For all the subsites most common type of recurrence was distant recurrence (Distal stomach- 38%, proximal stomach-55%, and body-41%). Most common site of recurrence was liver (32.7%), followed by peritoneum (28.7%), locoregional node (15.8%), mixed type (7.9%), anastomotic site (6.9%), lung (5.9%), and bone (2.0%). No statistically significant difference was noted among different subsites (p = 0.566), and specific site (p = 0.649).

Literature says that the submandibular salivary gland (SMG) can be involved by direct extension from the primary tumour (< 5%) or through metastatic node in level Ib (0.5-1.5%). Retrospective studies have shown that the SMG can be preserved in OCSCC except in those where the primary tumour or level 1b nodes are in close vicinity to the gland. The goal of our prospective observational study was to evaluate the involvement of SMG in OCSCC. We had enrolled a total of 142 patients from July 2018 to May 2020 fulfilling the selection criteria and planned for appropriate surgery with removal of the SMG. The postoperative histopathology report was then assessed to look for the involvement of SMG. We observed majority patients in their 4th-5th decade with mean age of 49 years. Majority of the primary tumor were staged as pT2-T3. Out of 142 patients, 76 (53.52%) were node-negative (pN0) and 66 (46.48%) were node-positive (pN +). Level Ib lymph node involvement was seen in 65.15% of the pN + cases. We did not find SMG involvement in any of the cases either from direct extension of primary tumor or from level Ib lymph node extranodal spread. We conclude that SMG involvement is extremely rare in OCSCC. It is better to preserve the gland for which a prospective study is warranted to assess the functional benefits of preserving the gland.",

    "ArticleTitle": "AI Chatbots in Oncology: A Comparative Study of Sider Fusion AI and Perplexity AI for Gastric Cancer Patients.",
    "AbstractText": "The integration of AI chatbots in healthcare, particularly for young adults diagnosed with gastric cancer, offers a novel approach to enhancing patient support and information access. This evaluation examines the effectiveness of two AI chatbots, Sider Fusion AI Bot, and Perplexity AI, in improving patient outcomes, alleviating anxiety, and promoting informed decision-making. A comparative study design was employed, utilizing a structured rubric guided by experienced gastroenterologists to assess the performance of both chatbots. Evaluation criteria included competency, accuracy, relevance, informativeness, and support capabilities. The study focused on a case involving a 21-year-old male with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Both chatbots demonstrated high competency and relevance scores, achieving perfect scores of 5. However, they received low accuracy scores of 1, indicating a need for scrutiny in specific details. Sider Fusion AI Bot excelled in informativeness (score of 5) and support capabilities (rated \"high\"), while Perplexity AI scored 4 in informativeness and was rated \"moderate\" for support. Both systems provided essential recommendations for alleviating anxiety and emphasized informed decision-making, but Sider Fusion AI Bot offered a more comprehensive discharge plan. The study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of AI chatbots in oncology, emphasizing the importance of tailored communication styles to enhance patient engagement and outcomes. Sider Fusion AI Bot's superior capacity for detailed explanations and user engagement positions it as a potentially more valuable tool in clinical decision-making. Ongoing research is necessary to address limitations and optimize the integration of AI chatbots in healthcare settings, ensuring they effectively complement human interactions.",

    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: This study delves into the exploration of exosomal transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) as potential diagnostic markers for cervical cancer (CC). Employing plasma-derived exosomes isolated through ultracentrifugation and confirmed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), qNano, and western blot analysis, we extracted total RNA from CC and adjacent tissues (n = 48), alongside exosomes from cervical cancer patients (n = 140) and healthy donors (n = 140) using Trizol reagents. The expression of exosomal tRFs was assessed through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and subjected to statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney U or t-tests, along with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The findings unveiled a significant downregulation of exosomal tRF-Phe-GAA-001 and tRF-Gly-GCC-037 in both CC tissues and plasma samples from early-stage patients compared to healthy controls. Remarkably, these two exosomal tRFs exhibited promising capabilities as circulating biomarkers for both the diagnosis and early detection of CC, as evidenced by their high area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.9337 and 0.9432, respectively. Consequently, exosomal tRF-Phe-GAA-001 and tRF-Gly-GCC-037 were downregulated in CC and early-stage CC, indicating their potential as innovative non-invasive biomarkers for early CC diagnosis.

    "ArticleTitle": "The Effects of Alpha Linolenic Acid (Omega-3 Fatty Acid) on Tobacco Craving Intensity, Withdrawal Symptoms and Biochemical Markers in Tobacco Users.",
    "AbstractText": "Tobacco use causes serious public health concerns and causes many health problems like (asthma, COPD, stroke, cancer, etc.). While a number of pharmacological treatments are used to reduce tobacco use, they often have adverse effects. Fewer studies have assessed non-pharmacological treatments {Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or fish oil} to reduce tobacco use. Omega-3 fatty acids, already known for their benefits in reducing bad cholesterol, managing diabetes, and helping with fatty liver, are now being studied for their potential impact on smoking habits. We aimed to evaluate the effect of omega-3 supplementation (flaxseed oil as a vegetarian source of alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) on tobacco craving intensity, withdrawal symptoms, and various biochemical markers in tobacco users. This single-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 104 tobacco users divided into two groups: omega-3 (n = 54) receiving 10 ml flaxseed oil daily for 6 months and placebo (n = 50). We measured tobacco craving intensity {Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)}, withdrawal symptoms {Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS)}, demographic parameters (BMI, WHR, BP, HR), and biochemical parameters (LFT, KFT, Lipid Profile) at baseline and after 6 months. Six-month consumption of edible grade pure flaxseed oil resulted in significant lowering of BMI in omega-3 group when compared to placebo group (p = 0.0002). Also, omega-3 effectively decreased tobacco craving intensity (p < 0.0001) and its withdrawal (p < 0.0001). More intriguingly, LFT panel showed significantly lower levels of bilirubin (D) (p = 0.0216) and SGPT (p = 0.0217). Urea level (p = 0.0489) was significantly decreased while creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were comparatively decreased in omega-3 than placebo group in KFT panel. Eventually in case of lipid profile, triglycerides (p = 0.0031), LDL (p = 0.0291) and VLDL (p = 0.0055) showed significant reduction in omega-3 group. Omega-3 supplementation with flaxseed oil effectively reduces tobacco craving intensity and withdrawal symptoms, suggesting its potential for aiding tobacco cessation. Additionally, it significantly improved liver and kidney functions as well as lipid profile, highlighting its potential for broader health benefits.

    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: Due to the lack of efficient diagnosis techniques, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to be the main contributor to global death from cancer. Consequently, our research aims to identify reliable biomarkers for diagnosing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by using serum exosomal short nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Based on the databases, we selected SNORD60 and further verified it in 48 paired FFPE tissues. To define exosomes isolated from the serum, we conducted transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and qNano besides western blots. qRT-PCR helped further verify SNORD60 in exosomal serum from 132 NSCLC patients and 143 participants in good health. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was employed to estimate the diagnostic efficacy of SNORD60, both alone and in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA21-1). SNORD60 was significantly overexpressed in tissues and serum exosomes of NSCLC patients compared to those of good-health individuals. To evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic biomarkers for NSCLC and its early stage, serum exosomal SNORD60 was found to have the ability to be a diagnostic biomarker, as well as CEA or CYFRA21-1 with an exosomal combination of SNORD60. The exosomal level of SNORD60 is significantly overexpressed in patients with NSCLC, which offers a promising diagnostic biomarker of NSCLC.

    "ArticleTitle": "Upregulation of SLC25A32 in Tumorous Tissues of Patients with Non-Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Pilot Study.",
    "AbstractText": "The SLC25A32 gene plays a pivotal regulatory role in one-carbon metabolism and redox balance by functioning as a transporter for tetrahydrofolate and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The probable contribution of SLC25A32 toward facilitating the proliferation of cancerous cells remains inadequately explored. This pilot study aims to survey the expression of SLC25A32 in non-metastatic colorectal tissues and its potential association with clinicopathological characteristics. Fresh tissue samples were collected from 30 colorectal cancer patients and their adjacent normal tissues. Total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized for qRT-PCR. In silico analysis was also performed to further investigate the functional significance of SLC25A32 in colorectal cancer by examining its expression in normal tissues, identifying protein interactions, and searching for pathogenic mutations. Our results revealed a significant up-regulation of SLC25A32 expression in tumorous tissues compared to non-tumorous tissues. The elevated expression of SLC25A32 was associated with tumor anatomic site and size. In silico analysis revealed that higher levels of SLC25A32 expression were correlated with reduced overall survival rates. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that this gene remarkably enriched in the process of Folate metabolism. The involvement of SLC25A32 in tumorigenesis may be due to its regulation of mitochondrial folate and FAD metabolism, which have been linked to cancer progression. Changes in SLC25A32 expression or function may contribute to cancer development, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between AGO1 and AGO2 gene variants with the elevated risk of bladder carcinoma (BLCA) using genetic, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches. This retrospective study comprised of 252 participants [122 BLCA patients and 130 cancer-free controls], matched for age and gender. The AGO1*rs595961 and AGO2*rs4961280 genetic variants were characterized using TaqMan genotyping assay. A bioinformatics framework, stratification analysis, and multivariate regression were employed. The genetic distribution of AGO1*rs595961 was associated with an increased risk of bladder carcinoma under allelic (OR = 1.50, p = 0.026) and recessive (OR = 2.01, p = 0.010) models. In contrast, the AGO2*rs4961280 variant demonstrated no considerable association with bladder carcinoma progression under various genetic models (p > 0.05). An in-depth examination of AGO1 and AGO2 protein revealed their involvement in gene silencing by miRNA, post-transcriptional gene silencing, regulatory RNA binding, and positive regulation of mRNA catabolic processes. The AGO1*rs595961 genetic variant was correlated with an elevated risk of bladder carcinoma, whereas the AGO2*rs4961280 variant was not.

    "ArticleTitle": "Glass-blowing, brass-playing, and other laryngocele etiologies: Fact or fiction? A systematic literature review.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Laryngocele is a rare condition, which can be congenital or acquired, characterized by an abnormal dilatation of the laryngeal ventricle filled with air. A correlation between laryngocele formation and increased intralaryngeal pressure has been postulated, as much as a frequent coexistence with laryngeal carcinoma. Despite this, systematic research on its potential etiology is still limited up to date. METHODS: We carried out a systematic an electronic search on the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for all articles related to laryngocele or laryngopyocele. The authors performed a PRISMA-compliant systematic review across multiple databases including all studies published until February 7, 2023, focusing on laryngocele etiology. Case reports and articles in languages other than English were excluded. The authors recorded etiology, age of patients, male-to-female ratio, history of smoking, symptoms, management, and overall follow-up. RESULTS: The majority of publications related to laryngocele are case reports and case series. We found a total of 10 articles correctly reporting etiologies, the majority of which included only a limited number of patients. Most case series explored the association of laryngocele and laryngeal cancer. Other reported etiologies were wind instruments' playing, cricohyoidoepiglottopexy's execution, amyloidosis, and chronic constipation. Some cases of congenital laryngocele were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Actual knowledge concerning laryngocele etiology appears-based on literature studies-inferential at best. The association between laryngocele and laryngeal cancer is, on the other hand, well-established and must be taken into account when evaluating patients with this condition. Wider and prospective data collections should allow further insight into this condition and its pathogenesis.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the influence of facility volume and type on the treatment and outcomes of pituitary adenoma (PA). METHODS: The 2004-2016 National Cancer Database was queried for patients with PA receiving definitive treatment. Tumor size represented the largest diameter of the primary tumor. RESULTS: A total of 89,863 patients (53.8% female) with a mean age and tumor size of (51.0 ± 18.0) years (Mean ± SD, later the same) and (19.5 ± 13.2) mm, respectively, were included. Patients were managed at 1,241 unique facilities, categorized into 1057 low-volume (treating approximately <10 patients annually), 142 intermediate-volume (treating approximately 10-30 patients annually), and 42 high-volume facilities (treating approximately 31-105 patients annually). Increasing facility volume and academic centers were both associated with higher rates of surgical treatment as well as lower rates of radiotherapy and shorter postoperative length of hospitalization (all p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis showed that increasing facility volume and academic centers were both significantly associated with improved overall survival (p < 0.001). On multivariate Cox-regression analysis after adjusting for age, gender, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index, tumor size, treatment type, and facility type, treatment at intermediate-volume (HR 1.238, 95% CI 1.155-1.329, p < 0.001) and low-volume facilities (HR = 1.413, 95% CI 1.306-1.528, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors of all-cause mortality, while facility type was not independently associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION: Management and outcomes of PA appear to be dependent on the treatment facility volume, with high-volume facilities, but not necessarily facility type, being associated with improved outcomes overall.",

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients undergoing tracheotomy from 2007 to 2016. PMI was defined by a postoperative cardiac troponin I (cTnI) > 99th percentile. Demographics and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic medical record and compared between patients with and without PMI. Significant univariate predictors were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to determine independent predictors of PMI. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality of patients with and without PMI were compared. RESULTS: Of 861 patients undergoing tracheotomy, 41 (4.76%) had PMI and 820 (95.24%) did not. PMI was associated with higher mortality at both 30 days (40.5% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001) and 1 year (73.2% vs. 44.1%, p < 0.001). Patients with PMI were older (median age 65 vs. 60, p = 0.002) and more likely to have prior myocardial infarction (MI) (36.6% vs. 10.7%, p < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (31.7% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.024). Cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of PMI (24.4% vs. 41.8%, p = 0.041). Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.033, p < 0.001) and prior MI (OR = 3.686, p < 0.001) were independently associated with PMI. CONCLUSION: Patients with PMI following tracheotomy had increased short- and long-term mortality. Increased age and history of prior MI were independent predictors of PMI, while cancer was associated with a lower risk of PMI following tracheotomy. ICU patients likely have more acute ailments contributing to a higher risk of PMI and poorer outcomes compared to cancer patients requiring tracheotomy. We propose routine screening for PMI with cTnI in the postoperative period in all tracheotomy patients.",

While, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in recent decades. AIM: The aim of the study was assessment of the level of illness acceptance, sexual, and urinary disorders among men with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. METHODS: In the study, 100 patients who have been treated in the urology departments because of benign hyperplasia or prostate cancer participated. The Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15), and International Prostate Symptom Scale (IPSS) were used in the research. RESULTS: The respondents weakly accepted their illness (26.9 points). The intensity of symptoms accompanying prostate diseases was moderate (18.8 points), and they were mainly characterized by moderate disorders in the IIEF-15 scale (erectile function - 9.3 pts, orgasmic function - 2.9 pts, sexual desire - 5.1 pts, intercourse satisfaction - 3.7 pts, overall satisfaction - 4.4 pts). There are statistically significant differences in the acceptance of illness due to marital status and treatment method. There is also a statistically significant correlation between the level of symptoms accompanying prostate diseases (IPSS), illness acceptance (AIS), and the level of sexual disorders in overall satisfaction (OS). CONCLUSIONS: A low level of illness acceptance, moderate severity of symptoms related to urination, and serious sexual disorders suggest the implementation of broader help for patients, including psychological, sexological, urological, and other specialists.

Machine learning (ML) has enabled in-depth analysis of complex patterns from large, diverse datasets, greatly facilitating \"healthcare automation\" in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Despite these advancements, ML models face challenges stemming from limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the inherent heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about interpretability and consistency with existing biomedical knowledge. One approach to address these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into data-driven models, which has proven potential to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of model results. Here, we review the state-of-the-art ML studies that leverage the fusion of biomedical knowledge and data, termed knowledge-informed machine learning (KIML), to advance cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

    "ArticleTitle": "Longitudinal Monitoring of T cell Dynamics in Metastatic Breast Cancer via a Remote Diagnostic Implant.",
    "AbstractText": "Metastatic triple negative breast cancer poses a significant health challenge due to rapid progression and limited treatment options. Immunotherapies targeting T cell responses against metastatic tumors depend on the presence of specific T cell phenotypes, which dynamically evolve with disease progression and treatment. Herein, we investigate T cell phenotype dynamics throughout metastatic disease progression, focusing on both the metastatic site in the lung and a biomaterial implant that serves as a synthetic metastatic niche, with the latter providing an accessible, non-vital tissue for longitudinal analysis. Regulatory T cells were reduced at the lung and scaffold implant sites of metastasis following disease onset and progression relative to healthy mice, while Th1 and Th17 populations remained relatively stable. CD8+ T cells transitioned from naïve and central memory to effector memory with disease progression. Additionally, functional analyses involving the metastatic tissues suggested the primary T cell suppressive mechanisms was reduced migration, with no impact on T cell activation. Blood-based analyses demonstrated some of these phenotypic dynamics yet does not recapitulate the functional assays. Collectively, the scaffold provides a platform for dynamically monitoring T cell phenotypes and functions similar to the metastatic lung, enabling longitudinal monitoring of disease progression that could stratify patient populations.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Molecular docking and MD simulation approach to identify potential phytochemical lead molecule against triple negative breast cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined as tumors that lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, demonstrates high aggressiveness, and has a relatively poor prognosis and clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel drug target protein against TNBC and potential phytochemical lead molecules against the identified target. METHODS: In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Additionally, the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area salvation was used to identify potential lead molecule. RESULT: The upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were identified. Androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub target in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer target were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Thereby, the AR was found to be the target protein and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule for combating TNBC. Moreover, the AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex showed structural stability and higher binding affinity through molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA studies. CONCLUSION: AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC requires further investigation both in vitro and in vivo.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Bayesian Estimation of Propensity Scores for Integrating Multiple Cohorts with High-Dimensional Covariates.",
    "AbstractText": "Comparative meta-analyses of groups of subjects by integrating multiple observational studies rely on estimated propensity scores (PSs) to mitigate covariate imbalances. However, PS estimation grapples with the theoretical and practical challenges posed by high-dimensional covariates. Motivated by an integrative analysis of breast cancer patients across seven medical centers, this paper tackles the challenges of integrating multiple observational datasets. The proposed inferential technique, called Bayesian Motif Submatrices for Covariates (B-MSC), addresses the curse of dimensionality by a hybrid of Bayesian and frequentist approaches. B-MSC uses nonparametric Bayesian \"Chinese restaurant\" processes to eliminate redundancy in the high-dimensional covariates and discover latent motifs or lower-dimensional structures. With these motifs as potential predictors, standard regression techniques can be utilized to accurately infer the PSs and facilitate covariate-balanced group comparisons. Simulations and meta-analysis of the motivating cancer investigation demonstrate the efficacy of the B-MSC approach to accurately estimate the propensity scores and efficiently address covariate imbalance when integrating observational health studies with high-dimensional covariates.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Lipid Nanoparticle Delivery of mRNA and siRNA for Concurrent Restoration of Tumor Suppressor and Inhibition of Tumorigenic Driver in Prostate Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "Cancer is commonly caused by a gain of function in proto-oncogenes and a simultaneous loss of function in tumor suppressor genes. Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is often linked with changes in the activity or expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a well-known tumor suppressor, and androgen receptor (AR), a pro-tumorigenic transcription factor. However, no therapies exist for the simultaneous correction of tumorigenic promotion and suppressor depletion. Here, we report that concurrent PTEN restoration and AR silencing by lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of PTEN messenger RNA (mPTEN) and AR small interfering RNA (siAR) elicited synergistic therapeutic effects in PCa cells. We screened various LNP formulations for the optimal delivery of both RNAs. In C4-2 and LNCaP cells, both of which are AR-positive and PTEN-null PCa cell lines, the combinatorial treatment of siAR and mPTEN LNPs resulted in much stronger cytotoxicity in vitro than the treatment of either alone. Western blot analyses revealed concurrent regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, leading to increased caspase-3 cleavage-mediated apoptosis. Our findings suggest that the strategy of RNA-mediated concurrent restoration of tumor suppressors and inhibition of tumorigenic drivers could lead to the more effective treatment of PCa and potentially other malignancies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Coupled Dynamics in Phenotype and Tissue Spaces Shape the Three-Dimensional Cancer Invasion.",
    "AbstractText": "The metastasis of solid tumors hinges on cancer cells navigating through complex three-dimensional tissue environments, characterized by mechanical heterogeneity and biological diversity. This process is closely linked to the dynamic migration behavior exhibited by cancer cells, which dictates the invasiveness of tumors. In our study, we investigate tumor spheroids composed of breast cancer cells embedded in three-dimensional (3D) collagen matrices. Through a combination of quantitative experiments, artificial-intelligence-driven image processing, and mathematical modeling, we uncover rapid transitions in cell phenotypes and phenotype-dependent motility among disseminating cells originating from tumor spheroids. Persistent invasion leads to continuous remodeling of the extracellular matrix surrounding the spheroids, altering the landscape of migration phenotypes. Consequently, filopodial cells emerge as the predominant phenotype across diverse extracellular matrix conditions. Our findings unveil the complex mesoscale dynamics of invading tumor spheroids, shedding light on the complex interplay between migration phenotype plasticity, microenvironment remodeling, and cell motility within 3D extracellular matrices.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Studies have compared diabetes management quality indicators, focusing on physiological markers such as hemoglobin A1c, between cancer survivors with diabetes and general diabetes patients. However, research comparing differences in diabetes self-management behaviors and the factors influencing them between these groups is lacking. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare self-management behaviors, guided by the information-motivation-behavior model, between cancer survivors with diabetes and general diabetes patients. In addition, we aimed to identify differences in factors such as diabetes knowledge, attitudes, family support, and self-efficacy that may influence diabetes self-management behaviors in both groups. METHODS: A total of 125 cancer survivors with diabetes and 126 general diabetes patients participated in this cross-sectional study. A structured questionnaire assessed demographics, diabetes knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors. RESULTS: Regarding diabetes education, 47.0% of cancer survivors and 61.6% of general diabetes patients received education. The cancer survivors had lower diabetes knowledge scores (10.30 ± 4.15, P < .001), a lower perceived value of strict blood glucose control (4.10 ± 0.56, P < .001), and less family support (15.50 ± 7.50, P = .019) than the patients without cancer (13.51 ± 3.84, 4.25 ± 0.65, and 17.57 ± 6.40, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study reveals significant differences in diabetes self-management between cancer survivors and general diabetes patients. Cancer survivors showed lower diabetes knowledge, glucose control perception, and family support. These findings highlight the need for tailored self-management programs for cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study offers insights for developing tailored diabetes self-management programs and educational interventions for cancer survivors.",

    "AbstractText": "This article considers the concept of designing Phase I clinical trials using both clinician- and patient-reported outcomes to adaptively allocate study participants to tolerable doses and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) at the study conclusion. We describe a new isotonic patient-reported outcome (PRO-ISO) Phase I design with the flexibility of allocating patients to lower, more tolerable regimens if a large number of PRO-DLT events are seen at higher doses. We conduct simulation studies of the operating characteristics of the design and compared them to the patient-reported outcomes continual reassessment method (PRO-CRM). We illustrate that the PRO-ISO makes appropriate dose assignments during the study to give investigators and reviewers an idea of how the method behaves. In simulation studies, the PRO-ISO demonstrates comparable performance to the PRO-CRM in terms of recommending target doses and allocating patients to these doses. It also performs well relative to a nonparametric optimal benchmark applied to the PRO setting. Finally, we extend our methodology to account for the problem of late-onset toxicities.",

    "AbstractText": "Approximately 90% of African American patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer have multimorbidity - with obesity as one of the most common conditions. Obesity is related to negative impacts across all aspects of cancer care as well as more adverse side effects of cancer treatment. African American breast cancer survivors (BCS) show higher incidences of chronic conditions, like obesity, with barriers to body wellness. Lifestyle interventions can improve survivorship outcomes, but most have not been adapted to African American BCS needs. The purpose of this research is to explore and honor the lived experiences of breast cancer survivorship among African American women with obesity to better understand their experiences and perceptions of how their cancer journey intersects with other health behaviors and to identify barriers to health-promoting behaviors. A co-design approach with five participants was used to understand specific barriers to a healthy weight and lifestyle as well as potential solutions that would benefit African American or Black BCS entering an evidence-based lifestyle intervention that targeted weight and body wellness. Participants completed one co-design session for problem identification. This initial session identified the participants' most impactful cancer- and non-cancer-related barriers to building health behaviors. Cancer- and non-cancer-related barriers to a healthy lifestyle were identified from artifact creation and affinity diagramming for intensity and frequency. Top cancer-related barriers were pain and fatigue related to cancer treatment and its side effects. Non-cancer related barriers included time and responsibilities, lack of nutritional information and culturally, medically sensitive exercise resources, as well as restrictive definitions of health used by medical professionals. Both cancer-related and non-cancer-related barriers were identified as contributing to difficulty in maintaining health behaviors. Further research should examine how these barriers can be addressed in lifestyle interventions targeted to African American BCS.",

In addition to its value in planning new interventions and understanding existing ones, we suggest it can be used to help interpret findings of clinical trials and plan next steps in a research program. This paper presents an analysis in which we used the RTSS to retrospectively delineate targets and ingredients of an experimental treatment, Behavioral Activation and Problem-Solving (BA/PS), and then examined the attention control condition for overlapping ingredients that could clarify the control condition's unanticipated effects. Our BA/PS intervention had seven treatment components; three were unique to the BA/PS condition, but the attention control condition contained ingredients that mirrored those found in four of the BA/PS components. Our results illuminate the challenges of designing an adequate control condition for behavioral rehabilitation trials among survivors of cancer. This RTSS application was instrumental in refining our conceptual model and preparing for future research. It serves as a model for other cancer rehabilitation researchers, emphasizing the importance of intentional and transparent intervention specification to advance the field.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among circadian rhythm, sleep quality, inflammatory markers, and psychological distress in AYA patients with gynecological cancer in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 75 AYA patients in treatment for gynecological cancer, 64 of whom completed the Chinese version of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and the Distress Thermometer. Actigraphy was used to measure their objective sleep parameters: total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and sleep efficiency. Blood samples collected 3 times across 1 day were used to measure the average levels of interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor α. RESULTS: The mean score on the Distress Thermometer among respondents was 4.23, which was above the cutoff value for clinically significant psychological distress. High levels of psychological distress may be associated with circadian disturbances, poor sleep quality, and elevated inflammatory markers. In addition, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and tumor necrosis factor α averages were the dominant predictors of these AYA patients' psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Improving sleep quality and reducing the levels of inflammatory markers may relieve psychological distress among AYA patients with gynecological cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals need to actively focus on circadian rhythm, inflammatory markers, sleep quality, and mental health status in AYA cancer patients to better meet their therapeutic and psychological needs.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate women's experiences of sequelae at 3, 6, and 12 months after mastectomy. METHODS: A survey including women ≥18 years, cognitively intact, and Danish speaking was conducted from May 2021 to October 2021. The researchers contacted the participants by telephone using 4 validated questionnaires investigating phantom sensation, body image, quality of life, and sexuality. RESULTS: Forty-four women were eligible for participation, and 23 (14 women aged ≤65 years and 9 women aged >66 years) were included in the analysis. The results showed an overall decrease in the severity of physical sequelae and an improvement in body image and sexual function. However, the women reported concerns about the future and decreased sexual enjoyment. Nearly half of the women received information about sexuality from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated decreased sequelae during the follow-up period. Still, there seem to be unanswered questions concerning the quality of life and the content of information regarding sexuality. The findings require attention and further research to benefit the individual woman and her partner in accommodating the consequences after mastectomy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Persistent pain and concerns for the future are present for half of the women after 1 year. Information about possible changes in sexuality is not standard. A nurse-patient dialogue that discusses hospitalization and sexuality on an individual level can be a way to address concerns and challenges.",

We convened a diverse multidisciplinary group of cancer screening experts to evaluate current and future paradigms of HCC prevention and early detection using a rigorous Delphi panel approach. The experts had high agreement on 21 statements about primary prevention, HCC surveillance benefits, HCC surveillance harms, and the evaluation of emerging surveillance modalities. The experts agreed that current data have methodologic limitations as well as unclear generalizability to Western populations. Although a randomized clinical trial of surveillance versus no surveillance is unlikely feasible, they concurred that alternative designs, such as a comparison of 2 surveillance modalities, could provide indirect evidence of surveillance efficacy. The panel acknowledged the presence of surveillance harms, but concurred the overall value of surveillance appears high, particularly given a greater emphasis on benefits over harms by both patients and clinicians. The experts underscored the importance of a framework for measuring both benefits and harms when evaluating emerging surveillance strategies. The panel acknowledged performance metrics of emerging methods may differ from other cancer screening programs given differences in populations, including higher risk of cancer development and competing risk of morality, and differences in diagnostic workflow in patients at risk of HCC. These data provide insights into the perceived value of HCC surveillance in an era of emerging blood- and imaging-based surveillance strategies.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a synthetic polymer known for its hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, has long been used in drug delivery systems to prevent non-specific protein adsorption and to extend the blood circulation time of drug carriers and protein drugs. However, PEG has several drawbacks including poor stability, accumulated toxicity, and immunogenicity induced by repeated injections. Recently, zwitterionic polymers, known for their super-hydrophilic and antifouling properties, have been considered excellent alternatives to PEG. In this study, we synthesized a new zwitterionic polymer from biocompatible sodium alginate and lysine. METHODS: Sodium alginate (Alg) was conjugated with lysine (Lys) using the EDC/sulfo-NHS chemistry to form a zwitterionic alginate derivative (Alg-Lys). The biocompatibility was evaluated using in vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies. After further conjugation of zwitterionic near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye ZW800, an in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging study was conducted to evaluate the ability of Alg-Lys to enhance blood circulation time. RESULTS: Characterization of Alg-Lys showed that the carboxylic acid groups in Alg were completely replaced by Lys molecules. No cytotoxic effects were observed in the in vitro cytotoxicity tests of Alg-Lys-treated cancer cells and normal cells. Serum biochemical analysis confirmed the biocompatibility of Alg-Lys. ZW800-conjugated Alg-Lys exhibited strong fluorescence signals throughout the body 24 h after intravenous injection, whereas ZW800-conjugated Alg was rapidly removed from the body. CONCLUSION: The zwitterionic alginate derivative showed potential utility as a new delivery platform for imaging agents and drugs.",

Here, we systematically catalog this variation by assaying mtCN in 52 human tissues across 952 donors (10,499 samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project) and 20 murine tissues using qPCR, capturing 50- and 200-fold variation, respectively. We also estimate per cell mtCN across 173 human cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia using whole-genome sequencing data and observe >50-fold variation. We then leverage the vast amount of genomics data available for these repositories to credential our resource and uncover mtDNA-related biology. Using already existing proteomics data, we show that variation in mtCN can be predicted by variation in TFAM, histone, and mitochondrial ribosome protein abundance. We also integrate mtCN estimates with the CRISPR gene dependency measurements to find that cell lines with high mtCN are resistant to loss of GPX4, a glutathione phospholipid hydroperoxidase. Our resource captures variation in mtCN across mammalian tissues and should be broadly useful to the research community.",

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunoexpression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma cervix and study the distribution of clinicopathological features and recurrence of cervical cancer with respect to PD-L1 status. METHODS: A total of 140 patients were included in this multicentric ambidirectional study. Immunohistochemical analysis for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed sections using 22C3 PharmDx assay (Dako) and tumour proportion score was calculated. PD-L1 expression status concerning the distribution of clinicopathological features was further studied. RESULTS: This study included 133 cases of cervical carcinoma and 7 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (140 cases), with a prevalence of PDL1 positivity in 31.4% of cases with 15% (n = 21) tumours high positive, 16.4% (n = 23) low positive and 68.6% (n = 96) negative for PD-L1.

Along with Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2), androgen receptor (AR) is now emerging to play key role in disease progression of various molecular breast cancer subtypes especially triple negative breast cancers. Aim of this study was to find out prevalence of AR positivity in all breast cancers, correlation of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 index with AR positivity. To find out correlation of AR positivity with histological grade. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study done on 55 primary breast carcinoma cases. Routine Hematoxylin and Eosin stain as well as immunohistochemical ER, PR, HER2/neu, Ki67 and AR stain were done. The outcome was assessed in the form of relationship between AR and ER, PR, HER2 status and Ki-67 index and histopathological grade. RESULTS: AR positivity was seen in 69% of all breast cancers. AR positivity was seen in 8% of triple negative breast cancers. High Ki67 index showed 55% AR positivity. Grade II breast cancers showed 42% AR positivity. CONCLUSION: Cases with triple negative breast cancers have worst prognosis. Unlike targeted novel hormone therapy (tamoxifen) in luminal cancers and monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) in her2 enriched cancers, AR is looked upon as a target to treat triple negative breast cancer.

Recently, it was discovered that microRNAs (miRNAs), which circulate freely in the circulation or biofluids, have diagnostic or prognostic potential. The current study looked at the levels of expression of three miRNAs in the serum and follicular fluid (FF) of PCOS patients and healthy women. METHOD: We have shortlisted the most studied miRNAs-miR-21, miR-222, and Let-7b-from the previous literature, followed by individual quantification using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The present study results showed differences in the expression of miR-21, miR-222, and Let-7b in PCOS patients compared to controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for miR-21, miR-222, and Let-7b was 0.70, 0.65, and 0.75 in serum and 0.55, 0.66, and 0.59 in FFs, respectively. The combined ROC of the three miRNAs showed an AUC 0.86 for serum and 0.62 for FF samples. miR-21 showed a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI), and luteinizing hormone (LH) level; miR-222 showed a positive correlation with LH, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and 2-h plasma glucose (PG); while anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), age, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and 2-h PG were found to be negatively correlated with Let-b expression. Regression analyses showed a negative association of miR-21 with menarche, progesterone, menses, and antral follicle count (AFC), while serum miR-222 was associated with BMI and age. Let 7-b had a negative association with serum, oocytes, and the LH/FSH ratio. Bioinformatics indicates their predicted targets are potentially involved in microRNA in cancer, diabetes, the P53 signaling pathway, prolactin signaling, the Hippo signaling pathway, Ras signaling, and pathways in cancer. CONCLUSION: The study found that serum Let-7b, miR-222, and miR-21 were differentially expressed in PCOS patients, suggesting potential involvement in the pathogenesis or progression of PCOS.",

For urinary FISH analysis, 50 ml of voided urine was processed using multi-target FISH-containing probes for the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and the 9p21 locus. Histopathological examination of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) chips was performed on diseased cases only. RESULTS: All 50 diseased cases exhibited 62%, 80%, 76%, and 68% of uFISH sensitivity, uFISH specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) respectively. Among negative controls, results of 40%, 84%, 71%, and 58% for LBC sensitivity, LBC specificity, PPV, and NPV were found, respectively. Among the diseased cases uFISH positivity of 20%, 45%, 83.3%, 82.4% and 100% for Ta, T1, T2a, T2b and T3 respectively. Among the diseased cases LBC positivity was 0%, 20%, 33.3%, 70% and 100% for Ta, T1, T2a, T2b and T3 respectively. CONCLUSION: Increased sensitivity and specificity of uFISH than LBC urine to detect urothelial carcinoma (UC) reflect the better potentiality of the former to detect UCs. The limitations of uFISH analysis include sophisticated equipment, higher cost, and experienced cytopathologists/technicians. It is proposed to conduct more such prospective trials with recent biomarkers so as to reduce the frequency of cystoscopy in such patients.",

    "AbstractText": "Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are a group of patients characterized by specific needs in cancer care. Although only 5 % of cancers are diagnosed in this age group, malignancies represent a significant burden in terms of years of healthy life lost and the consequences of cancer treatment. Important issues for young patients include diagnostic delay, promotion of primary prevention, biologically distinct tumor types, oncogenetic evaluation, unique psychosocial challenges, fertility issues, monitoring of adverse effects of treatment including the development of secondary malignancies, or the absence of age-specific clinical trials. The centralization of care and the formation of multidisciplinary teams dedicated to young patients will allow for a more comprehensive approach with a focus on these issues. One means of improving care for young cancer patients is the development of national guidelines and the organisation of international and national clinical trials.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Hierarchical Active Learning with Label Proportions on Data Regions.",
    "AbstractText": "Learning classification models from real-world data often requires substantial human effort devoted to instance annotation. As the instance-based annotating process can be very time-consuming and costly, we propose a novel active learning framework that builds classification models from human-annotated regions. A region is defined by a set of conjunctive patterns that are formed by value ranges over the input features. A region label is a human assessment of the class proportion in the data population covered by the region. By leveraging learning from label proportions algorithms, regions and their class proportions can be used to train instance-based classification models. However, the key challenge is that in practice, very few regions are defined already. Therefore, to identify regions important for model learning, we design a hierarchical active learning (HAL) framework, which actively builds a hierarchy of regions. Similar to the decision-tree learning process, our approach progressively divides the input data space into smaller sub-regions, solicits labels for the new regions, and retrains the base classification model with all the leaf regions. And we further develop a multi-hierarchy (forest) solution, which builds multiple shallower hierarchies that have more informative, diverse, and simpler regions. We evaluate our HAL framework on numerous impactful classification datasets as well as on a real user study - on the survival analysis of colorectal cancer patients. The results demonstrate that region-based active learning methods can learn high-quality classifiers from very few labeled regions. Hence, our framework is shown very effective in reducing the human annotation effort needed for building classification models.",

    "AbstractText": "Many studies, from in-vitro and in-vivo to population-based studies, demonstrate undesirable effects of higher thyroid hormone levels on the development of cancer, as well as its prognosis and consequently an outcome of cancer patients. Thyroid hormones mediate cancer cells' growth, proliferation, and metastatic diffusion. Current data demonstrate an increased risk of solid as well as hematologic malignancies in patients with higher serum thyroid hormone levels and/or lower thyrotropin levels (TSH). However, the results are sparse. The present chapter will summarize studies investigating the correlation between hyperthyroidism, higher upper reference range triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels, and normal-low TSH with cancer risk and prognosis, respectively. The diagnostics, clinical management, and treatment of hyperthyroidism in cancer patients will also be illustrated. Finally, the importance of a prompt restoration of euthyroidism in cancer patients and the priority role of radioiodine (RAI) therapy to permanently eliminate hyperthyroidism in most cancer patients will be discussed.",

    "AbstractText": "Prediagnostic serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated form (DS) are generally increased in breast cancer patients; serum cortisol concentrations are predictably increased as well. The association of increased adrenal steroids with breast cancer may indicate a causal role. However, administration of DHEA to rats and mice has shown a beneficial effect of DHEA in preventing or suppressing breast cancer in numerous studies. DHEA treatment inhibits the development of spontaneous virally induced mammary cancers and suppresses carcinogen-induced as well as radiation-induced mammary tumors. DHEA also antagonizes the effect of estrogen on growth of human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice. DHEA is effective in suppressing cancer development in other organ systems as well including lung, liver, colon, prostate, lymphatic, and skin cancers. We hypothesize that the increase of DHEA in breast fluid and serum is the result of stress-induced adrenal activation and that the glucocorticoid component is the detrimental component rather than DHEA or DS. The mechanisms by which DHEA suppresses tumor growth includes the non-competitive inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, immune suppression of virally induced breast cancer, enhancement of natural killer cell cytotoxicity by both DHEA and DS, suppression of IL-6, and promotion of estrogen receptor beta expression. The evidence supports the use of DHEA or its derivatives for suppression of cancers regardless of the mechanism by which the cancer arises.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Hepcidin: A multifaceted hormone in iron homeostasis and tumor biology.",
    "AbstractText": "Iron is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including oxygen transport, DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Iron homeostasis is a critical biological equilibrium that involves the balance of iron absorption, utilization, storage and excretion. Iron is intricately linked to the pathophysiology of cancer. Its dual role as a vital nutrient and a potential carcinogen highlights the complexity of iron's influence on tumorigenesis. Iron balance is finely tuned through a complex interplay of molecular components and regulatory mechanisms. Hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide hormone, is the principal regulator of systemic iron availability. Hepcidin exerts its effects by binding to the iron export protein ferroportin (FPN1), leading to its internalization and degradation, which in turn reduces the release of iron from macrophages and the intestinal absorption of dietary iron. In human cancers, the expression of hepcidin is significantly altered, leading to increased iron absorption and retention. Hepcidin has emerged as a significant player in cancer biology due to its potential as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter. Understanding the context-dependent role of hepcidin in cancer opens avenues for novel therapeutic strategies. Modulating hepcidin levels or its activity could be a potential approach to treat cancer, either by starving tumors of iron or by normalizing the iron-rich microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the critical functions of hepcidin in iron metabolism, summarize the upstream regulatory factors that control the expression of hepcidin, and delve deeply into the downstream signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms by which hepcidin regulates the tumorigenesis, as well as elucidate the promising potential of hepcidin as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer, underscoring the significance of understanding and harnessing the complex interplay between hepcidin, iron metabolism and cancer biology.",

Decades of pre-clinical studies elucidated the route that certain cancer cells take to gain the cancer hallmark of uncontrolled proliferation, uncovering CDK4/6 as key players. Further investigation into the molecular underpinnings of this process revealed interconnected signaling between the CDK4/6 and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling axes, providing evidence that CDK4/6i would be particularly relevant in estrogen-driven cancers. Three FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, were independently developed and all exhibited efficacy against in vivo models of ER+ breast cancer. Clinical trials then confirmed the safety and efficacy of these drugs in patients. Ongoing clinical trials are now testing CDK4/6i in several other cancer models, including other hormone-driven cancers. Further mechanistic insights should reveal predictive biomarkers of response, and potential combination therapies to overcome resistance. This chapter provides an overview of the development of these drugs, their current utility, and their potential use in the treatment of multiple malignancies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The thyroid endocrine axis in breast cancer pathophysiology and prognosis.",
    "AbstractText": "The Estrogen Receptor (ER) is a well-established regulator of the biologic behavior of breast cancer and a biomarker of response to endocrine treatments. Other steroid and non-steroid nuclear receptors, including Progesterone Receptor (PR), Androgen Receptor (AR), Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) and Thyroid Receptors (TRs), are often co-expressed with ER in breast cancers and modulate its biologic effects. In addition these receptors are also expressed in sub-sets of ER negative breast cancers and act as alternative transcription factors with cancer associated effects. The isotypes of TRs, TRα, TRβ, and other receptors of hormones of the thyroid axis such as the surface thyroid receptor, αvβ3 integrin and the receptor for TSH, TSH-R expressed in sub-sets of breast cancers, have both pro-carcinogenic and anti-carcinogenic functions that depend on the specific cancer cell environment. For TRs, co-expression of ER is important for their respective transcriptional output as these nuclear receptors interact at the chromatin level. The surface αvβ3 integrin receptor, on the other hand, activates signal transduction pathways that may affect ER function and its ability to execute its transcriptional program. Based on the role of the thyroid axis in breast cancer tissues, therapeutic opportunities from the manipulation of the axis in breast cancer arise, and initial studies have been performed with intriguing results. A biomarker based approach taking into consideration the breast cancer sub-types, including expression of other nuclear receptors and the expression of nuclear and surface thyroid receptors in breast cancer cells, could provide therapeutic opportunities, in a personalized manner.",

    "AbstractText": "Steroid Hormone Receptors (SHRs) when bound to its ligand can act as transcription factors, which are responsible for transcription of important genes via hormone responsive element in our genome. Many studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms involved with SHRs. Cancer specific aberrant expression pattern of SHR and variation in their mechanism created an opportunity to specifically target SHRs for developing highly effective anti-cancer therapeutics. Further, these receptors can be targeted using different nanodelivery systems thus proving to be a potent target. The anticancer nanodelivery system can selectively target cancer cells due to the newly discovered aberrant nature of SHRs in cancer making it unique from other membrane bound receptors that are relatively more easily accessible as these are mostly overexpressed on the surface of the cells. One such interesting receptor which is present in the cytoplasm of the cells and ubiquitously expressed in both cancer and non-cancer cells is glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR as studied earlier behaves in a unique way in cancer cells which facilitates the nanodelivery system including small molecules to selectively target cytoplasmic GR and hence makes the anticancer therapeutics more precise in its own way. Here, we will summarize the knowledge of SHR providing information about its role in its molecular mechanisms in cells and mostly to dig into its anticancer therapeutic roles in cancer cells. Most importantly how the lipid nanoformulation can modulate the SHRs ligand binding domain in cancer therapeutics is also discussed. This also deals with all the SHRs including estrogen, progesterone, mineralocorticoid receptors and androgen receptors.",

Participants completed measures on demographics and body image perceptions and satisfaction. Body image discrepancy was calculated using the Figure Rating Scale, which assessed their current and ideal body images, and body satisfaction was examined using the 9-item Body Areas Satisfaction Subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. BMI was computed from objective measures of height and weight and categorized as normal weight (BMI = 18.5 - 24.9), overweight (BMI = 25.0 - 29.9), and obese (BMI ≥ 30). Results showed a negative association between body image discrepancy and body satisfaction, such that as body image discrepancy increased, body satisfaction decreased. This relationship was moderated by BMI. Stratified analyses indicated that increases in body image discrepancy were associated with decreases in body satisfaction only among men with normal and obese weight but not among men with overweight. These findings suggest that researchers and healthcare providers may need to consider weight category when developing cancer and diabetes risk reduction interventions to address overweight and obesity in Latinx men. For Latinx men with overweight, interventions may need to focus on other health metrics to engage them in weight management strategies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Tractography from T1-weighted MRI: Empirically exploring the clinical viability of streamline propagation without diffusion MRI.",
    "AbstractText": "Over the last few decades, diffusion MRI (dMRI) streamline tractography has emerged as the dominant method forin vivoestimation of white matter (WM) pathways in the brain. One key limitation to this technique is that modern tractography implementations require high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). However, HARDI can be difficult to collect clinically, limiting the reach of tractography analyses to research cohorts and thus limiting many WM investigations to certain populations and pathologies. As such, a clinically viable tractography solution applicable to wider patient populations scanned as a part of routine care would be of key significance in broadening WM analyses to underfunded or rarer diseases and to the clinical setting. Such a solution would require the ability to perform arbitrary tractography analyses, use only clinical imaging for input, and be open source and widely accessible and implementable. Thus, here we evaluate our recently developed, containerized, and open-source, T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based deep learning model for streamline propagation. We empirically assess its performance against traditional dMRI-based and established atlas-based approaches in a healthy young population, an aging one, and in those with epilepsy, depression, and brain cancer. In the healthy young population, we find slightly increased error compared to traditional tractography with the deep learning model that falls within the bounds attributable to dMRI variability and is considerably less than the atlas-based approach. Further, seeking to replicate previously published dMRI tractography effects in the remaining cohorts as an initial assessment of clinical viability, we find this model successfully does so in some key cases-particularly in applications that rely on long-range streamlines including those not captured by the atlas-based approach-but importantly not all. These results suggest a deep learning-based approach to tractography with T1w MRI demonstrates promise within the limitations of our definition of clinical viability and especially over atlas-based approaches but requires refinement and more robust consideration of out-of-distribution effects prior to widespread clinical use. We also find these results raise additional questions regarding the differences in image content between dMRI and T1w MRI and their relationship to tractography. Further investigation of these questions will improve the field's understanding of which features of the brain influence measured tractography effects.",

    "AbstractText": "In clinical trials, it is often valuable to borrow information from external data sources. Unfortunately, when the external data are fully or partially incompatible with the current trial data, type I error rates can be highly inflated under traditional blanket discounting schemes such as power priors, commensurate priors, and meta-analytic predictive priors. However, such inflation of the probability of a false positive can be necessary, as the alternative is to have an underpowered study. For clinical trials with time-to-event (TTE) outcomes, this problem is exacerbated since many observations are censored. In this paper, we develop the latent exchangeability prior for TTE data. We also present a novel framework to borrow information about the treatment effect between groups as well as incorporate information from external controls. Simulation results suggest that, although efficiency gains can be achieved by borrowing information among external controls, operating characteristics in general can be quite poor under a lack of exchangeability. We apply our approach to a real clinical trial in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer.",

Our method called Covariance Assisted Multivariate Penalized Additive Regression (CoMPAdRe) simultaneously selects among null, linear, and smooth non-linear effects for each predictor while incorporating joint estimation of the sparse residual structure among responses, with the motivation that accounting for inter-response correlation structure can lead to improved accuracy in variable selection and estimation efficiency. CoMPAdRe is constructed in a computationally efficient way that allows the selection and estimation of linear and non-linear covariates to be conducted in parallel across responses. Compared to single-response approaches that marginally select linear and non-linear covariate effects, we demonstrate in simulation studies that the joint multivariate modeling leads to gains in both estimation efficiency and selection accuracy, of greater magnitude in settings where signal is moderate relative to the level of noise. We apply our approach to protein-mRNA expression levels from multiple breast cancer pathways obtained from The Cancer Proteome Atlas and characterize both mRNA-protein associations and protein-protein subnetworks for each pathway. We find non-linear mRNA-protein associations for the Core Reactive, EMT, PIK-AKT, and RTK pathways. Supplementary Materials are available online.",

Therefore, we are in a seemingly paradoxical state of declining overall incidence rates of HCC-related to improved prevention and treatment of viral hepatitis but burgeoning number of people at an elevated risk of HCC. Several geographic regions have reported an increase in HCC attributable to alcoholic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction associated with steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The importance of risk stratification is increasing to allow for targeted prevention and early detection of HCC. Most risk factors predispose HCC through the formation of cirrhosis, which has served as the main risk stratifying factor. However, this scheme is showing cracks at both ends of the spectrum. On one hand, the risk of developing HCC varies widely among patients with contemporary advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and on the other hand up to one-third of MASLD-related HCC occurs among patients with no clear evidence of cirrhosis. The use of multidimensional (eg, clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical) predictive algorithms may improve risk stratification efforts. The shift in HCC risk factors also further heightened the importance and limitations of current surveillance practices (eg, reduced performance of ultrasound in MASLD). Therefore, exploring advanced imaging methods, new biomarkers but also existing combinations of biomarkers augmented by clinical factors for HCC early detection is crucial.",

The key advantage of this procedure over conventional approaches is that it has few side-effects due to its minimally invasive nature. However, the lack of an inexpensive and accurate monitoring modality hinders widespread adoption. To address this unmet need, we have developed an optical probe capable of accurately monitoring the ablation procedure in real-time, thus ensuring complete coagulation of the cancerous tissue. This is achieved by placing the probe at the desired ablation boundary and interrogating laser-tissue interaction in real-time to detect the onset and propagation of the coagulation boundary. Here, we validate this novel monitoring modality through in silico, ex vivo and in vivo studies. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to demonstrate the utility of the probe in a range of tissues including prostate, liver and brain. In all cases the virtual optical probe is capable of detecting the coagulation boundary without any tissue specific calibration. Next, an ex vivo bovine liver study is presented in which laser ablation under optical probe monitoring is shown to be capable of creating ablation zones with a radial accuracy better than 1mm. Finally, case studies from the first clinical trial of this technology are presented showing successful adoption of this technique for monitoring laser ablation of prostate cancer.",

However, traditional approaches of fitting the model via separate node-wise lasso regressions overlook the network-induced structure among these regressions, leading to high error rates, particularly when the number of nodes is large. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task learning estimator for fitting Gaussian graphical regression models, which incorporates a cross-task group sparsity penalty and a within-task element-wise sparsity penalty to govern the sparsity of active covariates and their effects on the graph, respectively. We also develop an efficient augmented Lagrangian algorithm for computation, which solves subproblems with a semi-smooth Newton method. We further prove that our multi-task learning estimator has considerably lower error rates than the separate node-wise regression estimates, as the cross-task penalty enables borrowing information across tasks.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features of 65 cases of UBUC and 38 cases of UBUC + IPCa after radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) from January 2017 to February 2020. We compared their expressions of the immunohistochemical markers androgen receptor (AR) and (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2,HER2) between the two groups of patients, and analyzed their clinicopathological characteristics by chi-square test and their survival rates using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: The detection rate of UBUC + IPCa was 16.5%, and that of clinically significant IPCa was 39.5%, with preoperative PSA≥4 μg/L in 23.7% of the patients. Compared with the patients with UBUC, most of the UBUC + IPCa cases had no smoking history (73.8% vs 92.1%, P = 0.024), and fewer had histological variants (43.1% vs 10.5%, P = 0.003). The incidence rate of vascular invasion was significantly higher in the UBUC than in the UBUC + IPCa group (49.2% vs 21.1%, P = 0.005), and so was the rate of advanced cases (67.7% vs 31.6%, P<0.001). In comparison with the patients of the UBUC group, those of the UBUC + IPCa group showed remarkably higher expressions of AR (9.2% vs 31.6%, P = 0.004) and HER2 (43.1% vs 71.1%, P = 0.006).

CONCLUSION: Standardized sampling of prostate samples after RCP helps to improve the detection rate of IPCa. Preoperative level of PSA is not a good predictor of IPCa. Few patients with UBUC + IPCa have a history of cigarette smoking, and the predominant histological type of the malignancy is high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma, which is not significantly different from UBUC in prognosis. The expressions of HER2 and AR are significantly higher in UBUC + IPCa than in UBUC, suggesting that UBUC + IPCa may benefit from HER2- and AR-targeted therapy.",

We collected the general data on the patients, recorded the status of dissection of the lymph nodes and postoperative complications, and analyzed the significance of EPLND. RESULTS: The patients were aged (69.3±6.6) years old, with the preoperative PSA level of 8.43－434 μg/L, Gleason score (GS) 6 in 1, GS 7 in 9, and GS ≥8 in 19 cases. The operation time averaged (97.2±15.7) min, with the mean blood loss of (30.5±11.2) ml, and 3－42 (median = 13) lymph nodes dissected, less than 10 in 10 cases, 11－19 in 12, and more than 20 in 7. Positive pelvic lymph nodes (median = 4) were found in 13 cases, with a positive rate of 44.8%. Positive incisal margin was observed in 11 cases (37.9%), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in 4 (13.8%), and perineural invasion (PNI) in another 4 (13.8%). Lymph node metastasis was significantly correlated with positive incisal margin (P<0.05), but not with LVI, PNI or age (P>0.05). No significant vascular or nerve injuries occurred during the operation. GS 6 was detected in 1, GS 7 in 7, and GS ≥8 in 21 cases postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted laparoscopic EPLND is an important strategy for the treatment of high-risk PCa, which contributes to accurate pathological staging of the malignancy. However, evidence is lacking for its benefit to the survival of high-risk PCa patients, and more follow-up studies are needed to confirm its treatment effect.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing the hospitalization expenses of PCa patients and provide some evidence for effectively reducing the direct economic burden of disease caused by laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). METHODS: The author obtained the hospitalization data on 893 cases of PCa treated by LRP in a top tertiary hospital in Wuhan between January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2024. A database was constructed using the Stata 18.0 software, the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests performed using the SPSS 27.0 and R 4.4.1 softwares, and the influencing factors for the hospitalization expenses of the patients analyzed by multiple linear regression, quantile regression, and random forest algorithm. RESULTS: Out-of-pocket payment accounted for 64.40% of the total hospitalization costs, averaging ￥60 794.9, with the per capita treatment cost (￥20 631.6), drug cost (￥15 046.2) and consumable cost (￥12 469.6) as the top 3 items of expenditure, accounting for 33.94%, 24.75% and 20.51%, respectively. The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that the number of hospital days (β = 0.027), the number of comorbidities (β = 0.008), the mode of admission (with the outpatient department as reference, the emergency department ［β = 0.128］ and transfer from other institutions ［β = 0.251］), and the mode of surgery (with LRP ［β = 0.157］ as reference) all had statistically significant impacts on the sub-per capita hospitalization costs (P < 0.05). Quantile regression analysis revealed dramatic influence of the number of hospital days and surgical mode in different quantiles (P < 0.001), and random forest regression analysis showed the two influencing factors ranking the top two in terms of importance. CONCLUSION: PCa patients bear a heavy burden of hospitalization costs. The composition of the costs needs to be optimized, and efforts should be made to reduce the hospitalization expenses of the PCa patients by promoting the inclusion of medical consumables in medical insurance, facilitating the development of drugs and domestication of surgical robots, and reasonably shortening the hospital stay of the patients.",

METHODS: We retrospectively studied the clinical data on 108 patients undergoing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and transperineal prostate biopsy in our hospital from January 2021 to January 2023. Using PI-RADS v2.1, we examined the MR images of the patients with suspected PCa, compared the PI-RADS v2.1 scores with the results of prostate biopsy, and analyzed the correlation of the PI-RADS v2.1 scores with CSPCa. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and described the diagnostic performance of PI-RADS v2.1 for CSPCa in the PZ, TZ and MZs. RESULTS: Transperineal prostate puncture biopsy was successfully completed in all the patients, which revealed 66 (61.11%) cases of CSPCa with Gleason score (GS) 7-10. Suspected CSPCa was observed in 45 (95.74%) of the 47 PZ lesions, 8 (47.06%) of the 17 TZ lesions, and 40 (90.91%) of the 44 MZ lesions. The PZ, TZ and MZ lesions diagnosed by PI-RADS v2.1 were significantly correlated with CSPCa (r = 0.492, P < 0.001). The AUCs of PI-RADS v2.1 for PZ, TZ and MZs were 0.644, 0.732 and 0.811, with specificities of 66.8%, 57.6% and 62.1%, and sensitivities of 57.2%, 78.4% and 93.2%, respectively. The negative predictive values were 46.5%, 85.7% and 79.2%, and the positive predictive values 76.2%, 43.4% and 84.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The PI-RADS v2.1 score has a high diagnostic value for CSPCa in the PZ, TZ and MZs, with the best performance for that in the MZs.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the key genes involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) and those associated with the prognosis of the malignancy. METHODS: We obtained the single-cell sequencing data on 4 cases of PCa from the GSE156632 database. Using R language and the Seurat package, we performed cell clustering and annotation, selected the subpopulations of epithelial cells for differential analysis after quality control and cell type identification, and conducted enrichment analysis of the identified differential genes using the Hiplot website. Then we downloaded the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci corresponding to the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of these genes from the UK Biobank (UKB) database, and the clinical data and corresponding gene expression data on PCa patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), followed by univariate COX regression analysis of the impact of the genes on the prognosis of the patients after Mendelian randomization. RESULTS: A total of 1 566 genes were identified and subjected to enrichment analysis, which indicated that the differential genes might be enriched in the Ras, apoptosis and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways. Subsequent Mendelian randomization revealed 74 potential causal genes among the 1 566 genes, and univariate COX regression analysis of the 74 genes identified 4 possibly related genes FAM3B, JUNB, TMEM59, and KRT5. Comparison of the results of Mendelian randomization and univariate COX regression showed that KRT5 might be the most important gene influencing PCa. CONCLUSION: FAM3B, JUNB, TMEM59 and KRT5 may play a role in the progression of PCa, and KRT5 may potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and therapeutic target for the malignancy.",

METHODS: We determined the proliferation activity of human PC-3 cells by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay, and compared the proliferation of the PC-3 cells among the control, 5-fluorouracil and icariin intervention groups. Using the Bligh Dyer method, we extracted endogenous metabolites from the cells, analyzed the metabolic profile by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, identified the differential metabolites by principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discrimination analysis, and enriched the metabolic pathways based on the MetaboAnalyst database. RESULTS: Icariin significantly inhibited the proliferation of human PCa PC-3 cells. A total of 89 differential metabolites were identified, mainly including amino acids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, all with the tendency to return to the normal level after icariin intervention. Icariin significantly downregulated the metabolic levels of the glycerophospholipid metabolites phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and upregulated those of amino acid metabolites tryptophan, leucine, and proline in the PC-3 cells. CONCLUSION: Icariin inhibits the proliferation of human PCa PC-3 cells, which may be closely related to its regulatory effect on lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipid metabolism) and amino acid metabolism.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of GRIM-19 on the resistance of carcinoma cells to the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel in the treatment of PCa. METHODS: Using siRNA technology to interfere with the gene expression in PCa cells, we established a model of GRIM-19 overexpression / knockdown in PCa cells. We investigated the effect of different expression levels of GRIM-19 on docetaxel-induced death of the PCa cells by qPCR, Western blot and flow cytometry, and assessed the value of GRIM-19 in reducing the chemotherapy-resistance of PCa cells. RESULTS: GRIM-19 was down-regulated in PCa tissues and cells. Knockout of GRIM-19 significantly decreased the expression of siGRIM19 in the PC-3 and LNCaP cells, and reduced their death rate when treated with docetaxel compared with the control group. The expressions of GRIM-19 mRNA and protein were remarkably upregulated after transfection with GRIM-19, and the overexpressed GRIM-19 promoted the death of the PC-3 and LNCaP cells treated with docetaxel in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed a lower apoptosis rate of PC-3-R cells than that of PC-3 cells at different time points of docetaxel-induction at different doses. CONCLUSION: GRIM-19 is a PCa suppressor gene with a significant facilitating effect on the apoptosis of PCa cells, and the overexpression of GRIM-19 promotes docetaxel-induced PCa cell death and improves the sensitivity of chemotherapy.",

METHODS: A total of 103 PCa patients underwent androgen-deprivation therapy + double-agent chemotherapy from May 2018 to May 2021. We collected the clinical data from the patients, determined their genotypes using the PCR-PFLP method, analyzed the association of the locus polymorphisms of GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 with chemotherapy sensitivity, and investigated the correlation of GSTP1 and XRCC1 gene polymorphisms with the 3-year survival rate of the patients. RESULTS: The distribution of GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 loci in the 103 PCa patients receiving chemotherapy was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ2 = 9.794, P > 0.05). At the GSTP1-rs1695 locus, the AA genotype accounted for 65.05% (67/103), the AG genotype 23.30% (24/103) and the GG genotype 11.65% (12/103); at the XRCC1-rs25487 locus, the AA genotype accounted for 29.13% (30/103), the AG genotype 50.49% (52/103) and the GG genotype 20.39% (21/103). Chemotherapy sensitivity was significantly lower in the patients with the GSTP1-rs1695 AA type than in those with the AG/GG types (35.82% vs 58.33%, P <0.05), but showed no statistically significant difference between the XRCC1-rs25487 AA and AG/GG types (40.00% vs 45.21%, P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between the patients with different GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 phenotypes (P > 0.05). The 3-year overall survival rate was lower in the patients with the GSTP1-rs1695 AA type than in those with the AG/GG types, and so was it in those with the XRCC1-rs25487 AA type than in those with the AG/GG types (P < 0.05). Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the GSTP1-rs1695 AA and XRCC1-rs25487 AA types were independent factors affecting the 3-year overall survival of the patients after chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Both GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 gene polymorphisms have some influence on chemotherapy sensitivity and prognosis in PCa patients. The A allele mutations of GSTP1-rs1695 and XRCC1-rs25487 can decrease the 3-year survival rate, while their G allele mutations may help improve chemotherapy sensitivity and survival.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data on the males undergoing the initial prostatic biopsy in the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University with PSA of 4－10 μg/L from March 2010 to April 2021. According to the results of biopsy, we classified the patients into a PCa and a non-PCa group, and compared the hematological parameters between the two groups. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, identified the independent risk factors for PCa, constructed a risk-stratification model for the prediction of PCa and evaluated its efficiency. RESULTS: A total of 415 cases were included in this study, 107 (25.8%) in the PCa and 308 (74.2%) in the non-PCa group. Compared with the non-PCa males, the PCa patients showed a significantly older age, higher ratios of neutrophil to lymphocyte and platelet to lymphocyte, systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), red blood cell distribution width and cystatin C (CysC) level (all P<0.05), but lower red blood cell count and hemoglobin and free/total PSA (f/tPSA) levels (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, f/tPSA, SII and CysC were independent risk factors for the prediction of PCa (all P<0.05). Five prediction models were constructed based on the above risk factors, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the four-parameter (age+f/tPSA+SII+CysC) model was 0.745 (95% CI: 0.694－0.796), significantly higher than those of the other models (P<0.05). A risk-stratification model (low-, intermediate-, and high-risk) was also constructed based on the total nomogram scores, which showed a comparable performance to that of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for the prediction of PCa (AUC: 0.727 ［95% CI: 0.650－0.804］ vs 0.734 ［95% CI: 0.658－0.811］). However, the prediction rate by the risk-stratification model was evidently higher in the low-risk males than in those with low PI-RADS scores (1－2) (39.4% vs 22.2%). CONCLUSION: SII and CysC are independent risk factors for the prediction of PCa in patients with gray-zone PSA levels. The risk-stratification model based on age, SII, CysC and f/tPSA is comparable to PI-RADS in the diagnostic efficiency of PCa, with an even higher prediction rate in low-risk patients than in those with low PI-RADS scores, and contributive to precision screening and reduction of excessive biopsies in the diagnosis of PCa with gray-zone PSA.",

METHODS: While proven GC, IM, and healthy control(HC) patients were included, patients with the comorbid disease were excluded, and univariate analyses compared three groups. The receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve analysis was run for CBC parameters. The area under the curve(AUC) was evaluated, and a cut-off value was determined. The sensitivity and specificity of each parameter were considered. RESULTS: The GC, IM, and HC groups consisted of 72(33%), 73(34%), and 72(33%) patients, respectively. RDW, PLT, NLR, PLR, and MLR were significant between GC and IM. The highest AUC (0.727) was obtained for the PLT yielding a 56.9% sensitivity and 79.4% specificity at a cut-off value of 151.8. The AUC of RDW was found as 0.691 and 0.626 for pairwise comparisons of GC-HC and IM-HC, respectively.

CONCLUSION: CBC parameters, such as RDW, PLT, NLR, PLR, and MLR, have value in detecting GC. RDW also has diagnostic value in helping to detect IM. PLR can help to distinguish patients with GC from those with IM. These inexpensive, easily accessible parameters may help in the timely diagnosis of GC and IM.",

METHODOLOGY: The expressions of miR-153 and PRDM2 in NSCLC tissues and A549 cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). TargetScan was utilized to predict miR-153 target genes. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were carried out to study the cell proliferation and apoptosis. Western blotting was performed to examine the changes in the proteins in the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway following the miR-153 overexpression. RESULTS: The expression of miR-153 was decreased and that of PRDM2 was increased in NSCLC tissues and cells. Target genes regulated by miR-153 participated in self-vascular development, miRNA metabolic process and the Wnt signaling pathway. The overexpression of miR-153 led to an obvious reduction in the proliferation ability of A549 cells, a notable increase in apoptotic cells, and significant decreases in phosphorylated (p)-JAK2 and p-STAT3 proteins. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that miR-153 could directly modulate the expression level of PRDM2.

RESULTS: Twenty-six survivors of hematological malignancies (n=19, 73%), solid tumors (n=6, 23%), unknown tumor type (n=1, 4%), were interviewed. Most survivors (n=19, 73%) solely received chemotherapy and one survivor (4%) was irradiated. Median time since treatment completion was seven years. Fifteen survivors (58%) were previously lost to follow-up. Many survivors (n=19; 73%) self-reported late effects, predominantly pain and fatigue. Survivors (n=11, 42%) were limited in daily life activities: physical work (n=10, 38%), personal care (n=6, 23%), social activities (n=6, 23%). Eight survivors (31%) recalled being informed about late effects. Some survivors experienced a negative attitude toward cancer in regional hospitals. Follow-up duration was longer among informed patients (p=0.043). Survivors recommended education and survivor meetings and preferred their follow-up to be done at the referral center. CONCLUSIONS: Kenyan childhood cancer survivors self-report late effects, comparable in frequency, nature and severity to other survivors worldwide. Survivors and healthcare providers require education about the lifelong impact of childhood cancer and should have access to survivorship expertise to continue follow-up.",

    "ArticleTitle": "In-vitro scientific validation of anti-inflammatory activity of Punica granatum L. on Leukemia monocytic cell line.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The induction of the inflammatory cascade results in the production of a number of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), and proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-, IL-, and IL-6. This study examined the cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory properties of a methanolic crude extract of Punica granatum L. peel (PPM) on monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PPM along with Quercetin as reference was used to assess the cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells and describe its effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines such as COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6 against cancer cell line by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentage of viable cells significantly decreased which correlates to non-toxicity whereas quercetin was found to be highly toxic, the IC50 could not be calculated because of drug precipitation. There was a significant decrease in the expressions of inflammatory cytokines upon pre-treatment of the cells with PPM prior to LPS stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that no cytotoxicity was observed after the treatment of THP-1 cells with PPM (25-400 µg/ml), but at higher concentration (400µg/ml), the cell viability decreased to 84% and attenuated the expression level of inflammatory cytokines. The inhibitory effect of the extract on pro-inflammatory factors production may provide a theoretical source on upcoming treatment of inflammation.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Late diagnosis of prostate cancer is associated with high mortality, morbidity and low quality of life. We aimed to assess the time of diagnosis among prostate cancer patients in Uganda and investigate the factors associated with early or delayed diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of 280 records of patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer from January 2016 to December 2017. Delayed diagnosis was defined as the diagnosis done at stage III or IV Stage I and II were classified as early. We used modified Poisson regression to assess factors associated with early or delayed diagnosis. RESULTS: The median from symptom recognition to diagnosis was 12 months (Interquartile Range, IQR: 5-24), with 76% of patients receiving their diagnosis more than 4 months after experiencing symptoms. Notably, 35.7% of patients were diagnosed at stage III, and 46.1% at stage IV. Upon diagnosis, all patients exhibited elevated prostate-specific antgen (PSA) levels with median PSA of 100.2 ng/ml (IQR: 36.02-350) in blood. CONCLUSION: Taking a biopsy after 4 months of initial symptoms was partially responsible for the delay in diagnosis. Communities should be educated about prostate cancer symptoms and advised to seek health care early. Health care workers should be sensitized to suspect prostate cancer among patients to allow timely referral.",

METHODS: The clinical information of 120 PCOS patients receiving treatment in our hospital from March 2019 to April 2022 were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups, endometrial cancer (EC, n=35) and normal group (NM, n=85). Statistical analysis included t-test, c2-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient. We analysed the data using logistic regression. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the prediction model were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and calibration curves. RESULTS: The incidence rate of EC in women with PCOS is 10.91% (12/110). Significant differences were found in waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), visceral fat area (VFA) oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), estradiol (E2), and luteinizing hormone (LH) between the two groups (P<0.05). No statistical difference was found in age, hip circumference, menopause, use of intrauterine device, progesterone (P) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) between the groups (P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA and HER2 were independent influencing factors of EC in PCOS patients (P<0.05). The AUC of BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA, HER2 were 0.878 (95%CI: 0.810~0.946), 0.831 (95%CI: 0.751~0.911), 0.816 (95%CI: 0.704~0.929) and 0.737 (95%CI: 0.634,0.840), respectively. The model had more diagnostic effectiveness (AUC=0.973). CONCLUSIONS: In PCOS disease, high-level BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA, and positive HER2 show an increased risk in the incidence of EC. These findings suggest that BMI, HOMA-IR, VFA, and HER2 are potential markers for Risk assessment of EC.HER2: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, E2: estradiol, P: progesterone, LH: Luteinizing hormone, FSH: Follicle-stimulating hormone.",

    "AbstractText": "The senescence of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells is involved in osteoporosis. The combination of dasatinib and quercetin has been explored to alleviate bone loss by efficiently reducing senescent cell populations. However, senolytic therapy by dasatinib and quercetin requires a precise ratio for better therapeutic effects, which is hard to achieve by oral administration. Meanwhile, the poor water solubility of these compounds limits their bioavailability, and their non-specific action could hamper effective penetration and targeting within relevant tissues. Herein, we developed alendronate-functionalized liposomes carrying dasatinib and quercetin (Aln-Lipo-DQ), focusing mainly on senescence-associated osteoporosis induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Alendronate helps liposomes deliver dasatinib and quercetin to the femur and tibias, effectively removing senescent cells from bone tissue and increasing bone volume fraction from 5.05% to 11.95% in the chemotherapy-induced osteoporosis mouse model. We also found a 2.91-fold increase in bone volume fraction in Aln-Lipo-DQ treated groups compared to the control in radiotherapy models. This selectively targeting bone and reducing senescent cells holds great promise for cancer treatment-related and senescence-associated bone disorders.",

    "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is one of the first-line clinical therapeutic strategies for HCC. Still, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is hampered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and drug resistance caused by insufficient delivery. Herein, we developed a metal-drug self-delivery nanomedicine (FDAH) to improve the chemo/chemodynamic therapeutic efficacy of HCC. The core of FDAH is an iron-based nanoparticle chelated with two clinical drugs, Doxorubicin (DOX) and Plerixafor (AMD3100). Additionally, the nanomedicine is externally modified with a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell, which can prolong the circulation time of the nanoparticles in the bloodstream after intravenous administration. After entering the bloodstream, the nanomedicine reaches the tumor tissue through the EPR effect and is phagocytosed by the tumor cells via HA/CD44-specific interaction. Iron ion-mediated chemodynamic therapy is mediated by the Fenton reaction to generate ROS, causing an imbalance of redox homeostasis within the tumor cells and enhancing the sensitivity of tumor cells to DOX. In addition, AMD3100 intervenes in the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to influence the infiltration level of immune cells and promote DOX chemotherapy in tumor cells. This work suggests that alleviating immunosuppression via a metal-drug self-delivery system of the CXCR4 inhibitor can effectively improve the DOX chemotherapy and iron ions-mediated chemodynamic therapy.",

Herein, we propose an innovative nanoparticle delivery system co-encapsulating DOX and berberine (BER), a natural alkaloid eliminating CSCs and downregulating PD-L1, to enhance chemo-immunotherapy effectiveness. In this study, a modified solvent-dialysis approach was used to encapsulate DOX and BER with hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan (CS). The formulation was characterized by size, zeta potential, morphology and FT-IR. In vitro studies evaluated encapsulation efficiency, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and disruption of CSC-enriched mammospheres. In vivo experiments assessed tumor-targeting efficacy, antitumor activity, and safety in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model. Consequently, (DOX + BER) NPs promoted tumor accumulation, reduced systemic toxicity, and advanced treatment in TNBC. Targeted distribution to CD44-positive CSCs and TNBC cells reduced CSC viability and PD-L1 expression. Investigations demonstrated that (DOX + BER) NPs superior to free DOX. These findings suggest that the HA-CS nanoparticle delivery system for DOX and BER co-administration may help to treat TNBC by eliminating CSCs and downregulating PD-L1. This unique combination therapy improves DOX-triggered ICD, improving chemo-immunotherapy responsiveness.",

    "AbstractText": "Background and Clinical Significance: Femoral neck fracture frequently occurs in the elderly population but may also present in patients diagnosed with primary cancer or bone metastases. A pathological, oligosymptomatic fracture associated with epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE), a rare endothelial cell-derived sarcoma, is uncommon. Case Presentation: A 44-year-old patient underwent biopsy procedures three times (2010, 2012, 2013) for a focal lesion of the left ischium, none confirming its malignant nature. The last biopsy revealed a neoplastic tissue with features of discrete dysplasia. The lesion did not undergo medical follow-up for seven consecutive years. In August 2020, the patient presented with right lower limb pain. A CT scan, PET/CT scan, and biopsy confirmed EHE with spindle/sarcomatous features. In November 2020, chemotherapy (5xADIC) started (PET/CT confirmed a partial response). After its completion in July 2021, bone progression occurred and sirolimus-based therapy was started. After 3 months, a small liver metastasis was visualized on PET/CT, which did not result in the termination of treatment. In December 2021, pamidronate-based antiresorptive therapy was started. Liver metastasis remained stable in follow-up CT scans. Due to pelvic and spinal lesions, the patient was assisted by elbow crutches and underwent radiotherapy, remaining professionally active. The patient did not report any trauma, but in August 2023, a subsequent CT scan revealed a subcapital fracture of the left femoral neck in the fusion phase. Due to pelvic changes and the stable nature of the fracture, surgical treatment was abandoned. Conclusions: An oligosymptomatic femoral neck fracture, not requiring medical intervention is considered a rare complication of bone cancer.",

They may cause various conditions leading to respiratory failure, including myasthenic syndromes and myositis. However, diaphragmatic paralysis (DP) has rarely been reported. To describe patients with diaphragmatic paralysis in a pharmacovigilance registry, we searched the prospective REISAMIC registry at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (Villejuif, France) for cases of diaphragmatic palsy (DP) occurring from September 2014 to December 2021. Case Presentation: We identified three patients, in whom DP was confirmed by diaphragmatic ultrasonography, pulmonary function tests, and/or diaphragmatic electroneuromyogram. Diaphragmatic palsy was life-threatening in all patients, as it caused respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In all cases, a pre-existing subclinical paraneoplastic syndrome was detected. Onconeural antibodies (anti-titin and anti-VGCC) were detected in these patients before and after the initiation of ICI therapy, suggesting a mixed paraneoplastic syndrome with features overlapping those of myasthenic syndrome (myasthenia gravis in one patient and Lambert-Eaton syndrome in another) and myositis. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic palsy is a severe irAE potentially resulting from different mechanisms, including myositis and neuromuscular junction involvement (myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton). Antineuronal antibodies associated with such conditions were already present in our patients prior to immunotherapy initiation, suggesting ICIs could trigger flare-ups of pre-existing silent paraneoplastic autoimmune conditions.",

    "AbstractText": "Precision medicine aims to provide diagnosis and treatment accounting for individual differences. To develop machine learning models in support of precision medicine, personalized models are expected to have better performance than one-model-fits-all approaches. A significant challenge, however, is the limited number of labeled samples that can be collected from each individual due to practical constraints. Transfer Learning (TL) addresses this challenge by leveraging the information of other patients with the same disease (i.e., the source domain) when building a personalized model for each patient (i.e., the target domain). We propose Weakly-Supervised Transfer Learning (WS-TL) to tackle two challenges that existing TL algorithms do not address well: (i) the target domain has only a few or even no labeled samples; (ii) how to integrate domain knowledge into the TL design. We design a novel mathematical framework of WS-TL to learn a model for the target domain based on paired samples whose order relationships are inferred from domain knowledge, while at the same time integrating labeled samples in the source domain for transfer learning. Also, we propose an efficient active sampling strategy to select informative paired samples. Theoretical properties were investigated. Finally, we present a real-world application in precision medicine of brain cancer, where WS-TL is used to build personalized patient models to predict Tumor Cell Density (TCD) distribution across the brain based on MRI images. WS-TL has the highest accuracy compared to a variety of existing TL algorithms. The predicted TCD map for each patient can help facilitate individually optimized treatment.",

We establish the consistency and the asymptotic normality of the calibration weighting estimator.

    "AbstractText": "Ovarian cancer is a prevalent gynecological malignancy with high mortality and low survival rates. The absence of specific symptoms in early stages often leads to late-stage diagnoses. Standard treatment typically includes surgery followed by platinum and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Exosomes, nanoscale vesicles released by various cell types, are key in intercellular communication, carrying biologically active molecules like proteins, lipids, enzymes, mRNA, and miRNAs. They are involved in tumor microenvironment remodeling, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. Emerging research highlights exosomes as drug carriers and therapeutic targets to suppress anti-tumor immune responses. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enables multiplexed, sensitive, and rapid detection of exosome surface proteins, offering advantages such as low background noise, no photobleaching, robustness, and high sensitivity over other detection methods. This review explores the relationship between exosomes and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer, examining the mechanisms by which exosomes contribute to drug resistance and their clinical implications. The goal is to provide new insights into chemoresistance mechanisms, improve diagnosis and intervention strategies, and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity in clinical treatments. In addition, the prospects of exosomes as drug carriers to resist chemical resistance and improve the survival of ovarian cancer patients are summarized.

In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by microlaser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides >6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36×40-pixel array captures images with < 125  μ m resolution.

We conducted BCC screening in April 2021, focusing on the presence or absence of multiple lesions. Patients examined between April 2021 and March 2022 (161 lesions in 136 patients) were classified as the screening group (SG) and those examined between April 2020 and March 2021 (111 lesions in 103 patients) were classified as the non-screening group (NSG).

We provisionally classified the head and neck gaze region into the 'central region' and 'peripheral region' based on gaze patterns. In the SG, the proportion of lesions in the peripheral region was higher in patients with multiple BCCs (32.6%) than in patients with a solitary BCC (14.8%).

In a minority of tumors, telomeres are lengthened via Alternative Maintenance of Telomeres (ALT), a telomerase-independent pathway based on homologous recombination. ALT tumors have heavily rearranged genomes with many structural variants containing telomere repeats. To better understand the genetic evolution of these tumors, we seek to determine if certain genomic loci tend to spatially associate with telomeres in ALT and are especially liable to experience telomere recombination events as a result. Assays that reveal close spatial associations between genomic loci, such as SPRITE and Hi-C, have enabled extensive exploration of genomic spatial organization. However, as analysis pipelines for these next-generation sequencing-based assays typically discard reads aligning to repetitive elements, little is known about the spatial arrangement of telomeres and other repetitive loci in the nucleus. Here, we present TelSPRITE, a novel approach to extracting telomere contact frequencies from SPRITE data. We identify reads containing telomere repeats and sort them into a single bin, quantifying spatial contacts between the telomere bin and the rest of the genome. Our analysis reveals a strong dependency of telomere contact frequency on chromosomal distance from the telomere, consistent with the known effect of linear distance on 3-dimensional spatial contacts. Telomere contacts are also strongly enriched near centromeres, a phenomenon that may be reflective of spatial clustering of heterochromatic regions. ALT cell lines are globally enriched for telomere content and display distinctive intrachromosomal spikes in telomere contact frequency. Our customized analysis of long read sequencing data suggests that loci with high telomere contact frequencies represent structural variants containing telomere repeats in ALT cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate general principles of telomeric spatial organization while also profiling the spectrum of genomic rearrangements in ALT cells.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Journeying with the Dying-Lessons from Palliative Care Physicians.",
    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: Witnessing suffering and death in palliative care can cause moral distress, emotional exhaustion and maladaptive coping strategies. How sense and meaning is made from these experiences influences how physicians think, feel and act as professionals (professional identity formation or PIF). It also determines how they cope with their roles, care for patients and interact with other professionals. Timely, personalised and appropriate support is key as shaping how these physicians develop and contend with sometimes competing beliefs and roles. The Ring Theory of Personhood (RToP) and the Krishna-Pisupati Model (KPM) offer a means of mapping PIF and thus moulding, coping and meaning making. This study uses the RToP and KPM to explore how caring for end-of-life patients impacts the personhood of palliative care physicians. Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 13 palliative care physicians-eleven females and two males aged between 35 and 50 years-at a cancer specialist centre were conducted. Transcripts of the audio-recorded interviews underwent content and thematic analysis where complementary themes and categories identified were combined to form domains that highlighted the physicians' key experience of providing end-of-life care. The domains identified were (1) identity formation, (2) conflicts, (3) KPM elements and (4) support systems. Together, results revealed that palliative care physicians are driven by Innate, Individual, Relational and Societal belief systems that create an intertwined professional and personal identity, enabling them to find meaning in their experiences and adapt to present contexts within cultural norms and professional expectations. However, their failure to recognise their need for support when hampered by evolving personal, existential and clinical factors underlines the exigency for ongoing surveillance and a potential role for a RToP-based tool and portfolio system that can detect and direct timely, appropriate support to in-need physicians.

    "ArticleTitle": "A retrospective analysis of the association of obesity with anthracycline- and trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity in the treatment of breast cancer and lymphoma.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Trastuzumab and anthracyclines are mainstays of chemotherapy in breast cancer and lymphoma patients but may cause significant cardiotoxicity, which may result in alterations to chemotherapy dose, schedule, or agent. Obesity is increasingly prevalent in the United States and is a significant risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. We aimed to assess the relationship between obesity and the risk of developing chemotherapy-associated cardiotoxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who received trastuzumab or anthracyclines over a 5-year period from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012 at our tertiary care center in the Northeastern United States. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2. Cardiotoxicity was defined as demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50% or demonstrated ischemia or infarction on echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization. Bivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between demographic and clinical variables with cardiotoxicity status. Two multivariate logistic regression models were generated to assess whether BMI was independently associated with cardiotoxicity. RESULTS: Of the 368 patients receiving either trastuzumab or anthracyclines, 16 patients developed cardiotoxicity. Demographically, age, race, BMI, body surface area (BSA), and overall weight did not differ between the patients who developed cardiotoxicity and those who did not. The mean dose of anthracycline and trastuzumab did not differ between the patients who developed cardiotoxicity and those who did not. Obesity was not found to increase the odds of developing cardiotoxicity and was slightly protective. A non-significant decrease in the odds of developing cardiotoxicity was found for every one-unit increase in BMI. In a multivariable model using BMI as a continuous predictor and controlling for BMI, age, hypertension, chemotherapy type, and coronary artery disease, the only significant predictor of cardiotoxicity was a previous history of arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was not a significant risk factor for patients developing cardiotoxicity from trastuzumab- or anthracycline-based chemotherapy and may be a protective factor for cardiotoxicity. Additional studies with greater statistical power are needed to further evaluate this effect and independently evaluate obesity as a risk factor for cardiotoxicity.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation using multimodal optimization.",
    "AbstractText": "One of the highly focused areas in the medical science community is segmenting tumors from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The diagnosis of malignant tumors at an early stage is necessary to provide treatment for patients. The patient's prognosis will improve if it is detected early. Medical experts use a manual method of segmentation when making a diagnosis of brain tumors. This study proposes a new approach to simplify and automate this process. In recent research, multi-level segmentation has been widely used in medical image analysis, and the effectiveness and precision of the segmentation method are directly tied to the number of segments used. However, choosing the appropriate number of segments is often left up to the user and is challenging for many segmentation algorithms. The proposed method is a modified version of the 3D Histogram-based segmentation method, which can automatically determine an appropriate number of segments. The general algorithm contains three main steps: The first step is to use a Gaussian filter to smooth the 3D RGB histogram of an image. This eliminates unreliable and non-dominating histogram peaks that are too close together. Next, a multimodal particle swarm optimization method identifies the histogram's peaks. In the end, pixels are placed in the cluster that best fits their characteristics based on the non-Euclidean distance. The proposed algorithm has been applied to a Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and brain MRI Images for brain Tumor detection dataset. The results of the proposed method are compared with those of three clustering methods: FCM, FCM_FWCW, and FCM_FW. In the comparative analysis of the three algorithms across various MRI slices. Our algorithm consistently demonstrates superior performance. It achieves the top mean rank in all three metrics, indicating its robustness and effectiveness in clustering. The proposed method is effective in experiments, proving its capacity to find the proper clusters.",

    "AbstractText": "With advances in high-throughput technology, molecular disease subtyping by high-dimensional omics data has been recognized as an effective approach for identifying subtypes of complex diseases with distinct disease mechanisms and prognoses. Conventional cluster analysis takes omics data as input and generates patient clusters with similar gene expression pattern. The omics data, however, usually contain multi-faceted cluster structures that can be defined by different sets of gene. If the gene set associated with irrelevant clinical variables (e.g., sex or age) dominates the clustering process, the resulting clusters may not capture clinically meaningful disease subtypes. This motivates the development of a clustering framework with guidance from a pre-specified disease outcome, such as lung function measurement or survival, in this paper. We propose two disease subtyping methods by omics data with outcome guidance using a generative model or a weighted joint likelihood. Both methods connect an outcome association model and a disease subtyping model by a latent variable of cluster labels. Compared to the generative model, weighted joint likelihood contains a data-driven weight parameter to balance the likelihood contributions from outcome association and gene cluster separation, which improves generalizability in independent validation but requires heavier computing. Extensive simulations and two real applications in lung disease and triple-negative breast cancer demonstrate superior disease subtyping performance of the outcome-guided clustering methods in terms of disease subtyping accuracy, gene selection and outcome association. Unlike existing clustering methods, the outcome-guided disease subtyping framework creates a new precision medicine paradigm to directly identify patient subgroups with clinical association.",

    "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies, necessitating the exploration of more effective synergistic treatment strategies to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an innovative antitumor approach that can be combined with chemotherapy to achieve potent synergistic effects. Mesoporous silica nanomaterials (MSNs) are ideal drug delivery vehicles in cancer therapy due to their unique advantages. This study presents an effective and straightforward strategy to design an intelligent drug delivery system (DDS) activated by the tumor-specific weakly acidic microenvironment to achieve efficient cancer treatment. By incorporating the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and divalent iron (Fe2+) into the unique mesoporous channels of MSNs, we fabricated MSNs@Fe2+@DOX. Under weakly acidic pH conditions, the functional components Fe2+ and DOX of MSNs@Fe2+@DOX are gradually released at the tumor site. The released Fe2+ can then consume hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumor cells, increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides through the Fenton reaction, thereby inducing ferroptosis. The combination of DOX-induced apoptosis and ferroptosis results in further enhanced cancer treatment. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that MSNs@Fe2+@DOX had an excellent therapeutic effect on breast cancer cells and tumor-bearing nude mice. We anticipate that this study will provide a promising biotechnological platform for combined breast cancer treatment by inducing CDT and chemotherapy.",

    "AbstractText": "Lately, the urgency of precision medicine in cancer care through immunotherapy has reformed the arena of oncology. Although immunomodulatory therapeutics in cancer have been preliminarily concentrated on T-cells, emerging evidences have suggested that intra-tumoral B-cells and plasma cells have significant contributions in cancer prognosis primarily through the production of antibodies. B-cell oriented cancer vaccines have been used in early clinical trials of breast and other cancers after multiple preclinical studies. Passive immunotherapy via administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and emergence of anti-idiotypic antibodies have led to considerable advancement in oncotherapy. Endogenous production of mAbs would be of significant benefit in recurrent or residual malignancies and permanent infusion would help in the overcoming of issues related to pharmacodynamic variations observed in case of intravenous inoculations of bi or tri specific mAbs. This has directed towards the development of genome reprogrammed B-cells with the capability of yielding therapeutic mAbs independently. Genetic alteration through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) nucleases have enabled the introduction of transgenes into B-cell genome thereby stimulating the plasma cells to produce exogenous remedial antibodies. It also facilitates ex vivo B-cell editing to elevate specificities of antigen receptors and generate target specific antibody responses which cannot normally be evoked in patient's immune system. Hence, genome-altered B-cells possess the potential of engineered therapeutics against certain malignancies. Co-operation of B-cells in T-cell based vaccines are ultimate need for vaccine success. In this chapter, the mechanisms, challenges and potential advantages of B-cell editing in cancer immune therapy shall be explored. The prospects of B-cell editing in onco-therapy will be clearly elucidated with all its strength and weaknesses.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Reoperation for recurrent papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is associated with a high risk of complications and limited success in achieving sustained remission. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) presents a potential non-surgical alternative for managing locally recurrent PTC. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PEI in treating recurrent PTC. METHODS: From October 2017 to September 2021, PEI was administered to 39 recurrent lesions (23 lateral and 16 central) in 17 patients with PTC. The median follow-up duration was 21.4 months (range, 4.1 - 37.9), with ethanol injections delivered every 3 months under ultrasound (US) guidance as needed. RESULTS: Most patients tolerated the treatment well, experiencing only mild local pain, though one patient reported Horner syndrome following the procedure. In terms of treatment frequency, 31 lesions required 3 or fewer injections, while the remaining lesions required more. The mean initial volume of the lesions decreased from 0.12 mm³ (range: 0.06 - 0.34 mm³) to 0.03 mm³ (range: 0.0 - 0.14 mm³), representing an average reduction of 72.6% (range: 20.0 - 100.0%). Of the 39 lymph nodes treated in 17 patients, 21 lymph nodes (54%) were completely resolved. Seven lymph nodes remain under ongoing ethanol treatment, while 11 lymph nodes in 4 patients were addressed with alternative treatments, including surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous ethanol injection appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for managing locally recurrent thyroid carcinomas in select patients. However, further comparative, prospective, long-term studies are needed to evaluate PEI's impact on patient survival and recurrence rates.",

    "ArticleTitle": "SCGAN: Sparse CounterGAN for Counterfactual Explanations in Breast Cancer Prediction.",
    "AbstractText": "Imaging phenotypes extracted via radiomics of magnetic resonance imaging have shown great potential in predicting the treatment response in breast cancer patients after administering neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Understanding the causal relationships between the treatment response and Imaging phenotypes, Clinical information, and Molecular (ICM) features are critical in guiding treatment strategies and management plans. Counterfactual explanations provide an interpretable approach to generating causal inference. However, existing approaches are either computationally prohibitive for high dimensional problems, generate unrealistic counterfactuals, or confound the effects of causal features by changing multiple features simultaneously. This paper proposes a new method called Sparse CounteRGAN (SCGAN) for generating counterfactual instances to reveal causal relationships between ICM features and the treatment response after NST. The generative approach learns the distribution of the original instances and, therefore, ensures that the new instances are realistic. We propose dropout training of the discriminator to promote sparsity and introduce a diversity term in the loss function to maximize the distances among generated counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, followed by the breast cancer dataset, and compare their performance with existing methods in the literature. Results show that SCGAN generates sparse and diverse counterfactual instances that also achieve plausibility and feasibility, making it a valuable tool for understanding the causal relationships between ICM features and treatment response.",

    "AbstractText": "Background: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine carcinoma, accounting for 3.26% of all cancers. The most histologically, well-differentiated thyroid cancer is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Although PTC is regarded as an indolent tumor, a portion of the cancer cells metastasize to lymph nodes around the thyroid gland. Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a critical risk factor for tumor recurrence in PTC, which strongly affects disease prognosis and the quality of life. Methods: This study aims to examine how differences in the level of the thyroid profile and other risk factors may influence LNM incidence in patients with PTC in Taiwan. We carried out a single-center retrospective study. These PTC patients were retrospectively reviewed by the Department of Endocrinology from 2016 to 2019. A total of 165 patients were included in our research. Results: The findings revealed a close relationship with the level of free thyroxine (FT4), the level of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and lymph node metastases. The correlation in terms of FT4 (p = 0.005) and TSH (p = 0.417) with LNM was found as a result of the univariate regression analysis. In the multiple regression analysis, the findings revealed a close relationship between LNM, FT4 (p < 0.001), and TSH (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Although the predictability of the TSH should be examined further, the association between LNM and FT4 or TSH should not be ignored. The results could help guide decision-making and patient counseling, using the level of serum FT4 or the TSH as a possible predictive factor of the LNM in PTC.",

The aim of our study is to examine the presence of CSCs bearing CD147 (a marker related to local inflammation and associated with various cancers) through immunohistochemistry in oral lichen planus (OLP) compared to oral leukoplakia (OL) and healthy tissues. These findings could contribute to clinical practice by providing a marker for the prognostic assessment of OLP lesions with regards to their potentially malignant nature. The study sample consisted of paraffin-embedded oral mucosa specimens from the archives of the Department of Oral Medicine/Pathology, School of Dentistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece during the period 2009-2019. The study sample contained 24 cases of OLP (14 erosive and 10 reticular) and 30 cases of oral leukoplakia, which were compared to 5 normal oral epithelium samples derived from healthy epithelium adjacent to fibromas from other cases. Cell membrane staining of CD147 was observed mostly in the basal and parabasal cell layer. The statistically significantly higher expression of CD147 in the erosive lichen planus subgroup than in the moderately and severely dysplastic leukoplakia subgroup (p = 0.01) constituted the most important finding of this study. The characteristic expression of CD147 in erosive OLP suggests the presence of epithelial cells with CSC characteristics, but its lower expression in oral leukoplakias suggests a more intense relation of the CD147 marker with inflammation rather than with oral dysplastic progression.",

Secondary nephrotic syndrome, a feature of paraneoplastic syndrome, occurs in 11% of cases and is mainly caused by membranous glomerulopathy. The association between minimal change disease and prostate cancer is rare. Only one cause has been described in the available literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 77-year-old patient who was admitted to our department with stage 3 acute kidney injury and with nephrotic syndrome with anasarca (creatinine: 168 µmol/L, eGFR: 33 mL/min/1.73 m2, albumin: 18.5 g/L, total cholesterol: 6.86 mmol/L, urine albumin creatinine ratio: 812.7 mg/mmol). In the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, looking for a secondary cause is essential, so the parainfectious causes of nephrotic syndrome were excluded. An elevated prostate-specific antigen (10.69 ng/L) was found when screening for oncological causes, and prostate adenocarcinoma was identified on biopsy. A renal biopsy was then performed with a finding of minimal change disease. Despite the generally accepted guidelines of prostate carcinoma in that stage and age of the patient being watchful waiting, antiandrogen therapy was started with the cooperation of a urologist. There was a significant improvement in renal parameters in the patient (creatinine: 87 µmol/L, eGFR: 73 mL/min/1.73 m2, albumin: 33.4 g/L, urine albumin creatinine ratio: 27.6 mg/mmol). CONCLUSION: This case shows the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome. In the case of proven paraneoplastic syndrome, it is necessary to start treating the malignancy; however, in general, a conservative approach without treatment is recommended.",

We aimed to determine whether a CEA increase within the normal range can be linked to a risk of recurrence. From the period of 2006-2013 we selected 78 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer, who underwent curative surgery with or without neo-/adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy and had proper follow-up procedures. For analyzing CEA fluctuation, we used the smallest value of the CEA during follow-up as the reference. With the aid of a Chi-squared test, we have chosen the value of 1.1 ng/mL for significant CEA fluctuation. A total of 43.6% of patients had fluctuations in CEA of at least 1.1 ng/mL, with or without increases above 5 ng/mL. From these, in 79.4% of patients, the increases in CEA were explained either by recurrence (44.1%), adjuvant chemotherapy (20.6%) or benign pathology (14.7%). In 23% of the recurrences, a CEA increase of at least 1.1 ng/mL, but below 5 ng/mL, preceded the clinical relapse by a median of 8 months. Our conclusion is that an increase in CEA levels by at least 1.1 ng/mL within the normal range after curative treatment for colorectal cancer may serve as an early indicator of relapse or could be associated with other pathological conditions.",

    "AbstractText": "Background and Clinical Significance: Head and neck teratomas are embryonal tumors that develop when totipotent germ cells escape the developmental control of primary organizers and form a more-or-less organoid mass in which tissues from all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) can be identified. Mature teratomas may either transit into germ cell or non-germ cell malignancies or remain histologically mature with the possibility of growing, thus inducing certain complications when reaching a large size. This article aims to investigate a very rare case of a 6-year-old child who exhibited a recurrent intraoral mass with multiple conflicting biopsies. Case Presentation: A 6-year-old male patient was referred to the postgraduate clinic of the Department of Oral Medicine/Pathology, Dental School, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, because his pediatric dentist noticed an exophytic, intraoral mass, distal to tooth #75 during a routine checkup. The first histopathological examination showed a gingival tumor, classified as a small round blue cell tumor, with greater similarity to adamantinoma-like Ewing sarcoma (ALES) and less to synovial sarcoma. The second pathologist examined the same tissue specimen and suggested the extremely rare presence of an immature malignant teratoma. Following chemotherapy, the rest of the teratoma with the adjacent tooth #75 was removed, and the histopathological examination showed a mature teratoma. Conclusions: This case illustrates the crucial role of the dentist, and in this case of the pediatric dentist, to promptly diagnose the underlying disease. Genetic screening may assist in detecting high-risk populations. In such complex histopathological cases, the importance of cooperating with experienced oral and maxillofacial pathologists is highlighted.

Utilizing single-cell transcriptome sequencing and comprehensive bioinformatics tools, including the CIBERSORT algorithm, we analyzed the immune cell landscape within NSCLC tissues. Our analysis revealed distinct NSCLC subtypes and delineated the developmental trajectories and functional distinctions of cDC1 cells. Key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pivotal functional modules within these cells were identified, highlighting PU.1 as a critical mediator underexpressed in NSCLC samples. Functionally, PU.1 demonstrated the induction of the NF-κB pathway, which led to inhibited tumor proliferation and enhanced activation of cDC1, thereby suggesting its role in tumor immune surveillance. In vivo models confirmed the suppressive effect of PU.1 on NSCLC progression, mediated through its influence on cDC1 functionality via the NF-κB pathway. These findings propose PU.1 as a promising target for NSCLC therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the importance of transcriptional regulators in the tumor microenvironment.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Exploring the Potential of Epiregulin and Amphiregulin as Prognostic, Predictive, and Therapeutic Targets in Colorectal Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in regulating essential cellular processes that are frequently hijacked to promote cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC) in particular, the EGFR signaling pathway is frequently hyperactivated via receptor and/or ligand overexpression and downstream oncogenic mutations. Current EGFR-targeted therapies for metastatic CRC (mCRC) include the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab. However, intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted mAbs are commonly observed. Thus, additional biomarkers are necessary to better understand patient sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies. Furthermore, therapeutic targeting of alternative EGFR pathway components may serve as one mechanism to overcome EGFR-targeted mAb resistance. In this review, we discuss the mounting evidence supporting EGFR ligands epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG), which are overexpressed in CRC with potential key roles in tumor progression, as predictive biomarkers for EGFR-targeted therapy sensitivity as well as mediators of therapy resistance; though further studies are necessary to validate the prognostic roles and mechanisms by which these ligands contribute to resistance. Additionally, we review recent advances towards therapeutic targeting of EREG and AREG in cancer through the development and use of EREG- and AREG-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). We conclude with a discussion on the roadblocks to clinical implementation of EREG and AREG as biomarkers as well as approaches to enhance efficacy of current EREG- and AREG-targeted strategies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Racial differences in the incidence of mental health illness among ovarian cancer patients: An analysis of SEER-Medicare data.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) patients have an increased risk for a mental health illness (MHI) after their cancer diagnosis, but limited research exists on whether this risk differs by race/ethnicity. Hence, we used SEER-Medicare data to evaluate racial/ethnic differences in MHI incidence among OC patients aged 65+. METHODS: Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, NH White, and Hispanic women diagnosed with OC in 2008-2015 without a mental health history 12 months prior to their cancer diagnosis were identified from SEER-Medicare. Cox proportional hazards regression evaluated new MHI incidence in the first five years post diagnosis and the differences by race/ethnicity. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for demographic/clinical covariates and healthcare access (HCA) dimensions. RESULTS: We identified 5441 OC patients, including 364 NH Black (6.7%), 4982 NH White (91.6%), and 95 Hispanic (1.7%) patients. About 41% of NH White, 33.3% of NH Black, and 37.2% of Hispanic OC patients were diagnosed with MHI during the follow-up period between 2008 and 2016. In the fully adjusted model, NH Black OC patients were less likely to be diagnosed with any MHI (aHR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.82), depression (aHR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.86), and anxiety disorder (aHR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.84), while Hispanic OC patients were less likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder (aHR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.95) compared to NH White OC patients. DISCUSSION: NH Black OC patients are less likely to receive a clinical MHI diagnosis compared to NH White OC patients. Further studies on racial differences in MHI incidence after OC diagnosis in primary cohorts are needed to better estimate population-level prevalence less vulnerable to exposure misclassification and to account for patient-level factors impacting MHI.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a potential complication that can develop following cancer chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: Due to limited medical interventions for the prevention and management of CIPN caused by vincristine, a painful and common complication, further research to find the mechanisms of CIPN and the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies is needed. METHODS: We induced CIPN in male Wistar rats by administering intraperitoneal vincristine (VCR) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg for 10 days. Treatment involved micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) containing hesperidin and diosmin (MPFF; Daflon®) at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Our investigation focused on levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue and included a series of behavioral tests: Von Frey, grip strength, rotarod, open field, and hot plate tests. To examine the role of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the effects of MPFF on VCR-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN), we also tested the effect of L-arginine (100 mg/kg i.p.) as a NO precursor and L-NAME (20 mg/kg i.p.) as a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. RESULTS: Based on our behavioral tests, MPFF (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) effectively reduced some symptoms of VIPN, including mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia. Notably, TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the DRG tissue of the groups treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg of MPFF showed a significant reduction in inflammatory factors. These results underscore the potential of MPFF and the role of the NO signaling pathway in alleviating neuropathic pain caused by VCR. CONCLUSIONS: Micronized purified flavonoid fraction may be an effective treatment for VIPN by reducing mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and TNF-α and IL-6 levels in DRG tissue. The NO pathway may play a role in the effectiveness of MPFF in treating VIPN.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Translating evidence into action: overcoming barriers to gastric cancer prevention in Aotearoa.",
    "AbstractText": "Gastric cancer remains a significant public health issue in Aotearoa, disproportionately affecting Māori and Pacific populations. The marked ethnic inequity in cancer incidence and mortality, with Māori experiencing diagnosis at a younger age and higher rates than non-Māori, underscores an urgent need for targeted interventions. Helicobacter pylori infection, a known precursor to gastric cancer, is a critical contributor to this disparity. In this position paper, we discuss the current state of gastric cancer and H. pylori management in Aotearoa, identifying key challenges including inconsistent guidelines, rising antibiotic resistance and inequitable access to treatment. We provide a comprehensive review of international evidence on H. pylori management, highlight emerging approaches, outline strong evidence supporting a 'population-based test and treat' approach for H. pylori eradication, and present a 'road map' tailored to Aotearoa's needs. Our proposed strategies emphasise the development of Aotearoa-specific guidelines that incorporate polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based antibiotic resistance testing, the need to promote post-eradication re-testing, the establishment of a national registry to monitor treatment outcomes, and the urgent rollout of a population-based test and treat programme. We advocate for a coordinated effort that aligns with the principles of Toitū Te Tiriti and prioritises equity and justice in healthcare delivery. By addressing these barriers with targeted, evidence-driven solutions, we aim to reduce the burden of gastric cancer among Māori and Pacific peoples and achieve more equitable health outcomes across Aotearoa.",

    "AbstractText": "The transport system influences health, including the onset of new cancers, in both positive and negative ways. Transport affects the frequency of cancer via access to healthcare, employment and other goods and services of society; physical (in)activity; exposure to transport-related pollution and climate change. In addition, avoidable transport health impacts overload the health system that delivers cancer care. The current transport system in Aotearoa/New Zealand is the result of policy choices made in the last 50-70 years which have privileged the private motor vehicle. We discuss examples of local work to support a healthier transport system, including action research with government partners creating infrastructure to support healthy travel, health professional advocacy in transport policy processes and involvement in coronial processes and a subsequent government advisory group. These, and other attempts at change, have had limited impact because of the elements that hold the current system in place; the weak regulatory architecture and institutions, commercial influences on policy and funding arrangements. Creating a healthy, cancer-preventing transport system requires not just focus on specific policy changes but reform of the policy making apparatus to ensure healthy people and planet are at the centre of decision making.",

    "AbstractText": "Older adults (65+) make up 60% of cancer diagnoses and 70% of deaths related to cancer (Marosi & Köller, 2016). Although this age group experiences significant distress, behavioral studies investigating distress tend to be overrepresented by younger populations, leaving a gap in the knowledge about the distress needs of older adults (Chang et al., 2020). To bridge this gap, Dr. Katherine Ramos and Dr. Timothy Strauman of Duke University's Psychology Department conducted a pilot study that found two major themes related to distress in older adults: identity and resilience. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological impact of identity and resilience on the distress experienced by older adults with cancer. Using the two qualitative themes, identity and resilience, the researchers of this study conducted a narrative synthesis of contemporary literature surrounding identity, resilience, and their psychological impact on distress in older adults with cancer. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRIMSA) guidelines, the study found nine eligible articles. The study conducted a thematic analysis of the articles in this synthesis and found six themes: (1) reconstructing identity after diagnosis, (2) experiencing anxiety due to uncertainty of cancer outcomes, (3) needing to \"push along\" through a cancer diagnosis, (4) having access to social support increases resilience, (5) experiencing low resilience leads to demoralization, and (6) navigating cancer requires redefining oneself to confront cancer challenges. Future directions and clinical implications include adapting Self-System Therapy (SST) as a mental health intervention for older adults with cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) is a rare and highly aggressive cancer that originates in the bile duct; it has an average five-year survival rate of 9%, which makes it the cancer with the lowest survival rate among all 33 cancer types in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) Program. The aim of this study is to elucidate the key determinants of the high malignancy level of CHOL through computational and cell-based experimental approaches and, particularly, to investigate how bile acids (BAs) influence CHOL's propensity to metastasize. METHODS: Our study analyzed the transcriptomic data from 1835 tissue samples of 7 digestive system cancer types in the TCGA database and compared them with those of 330 control tissue samples. Multiple cellular and molecular factors were considered in the study, including the level of hypoxia, level of immune cell infiltration, degree of cellular dedifferentiation, and level of sialic acid (SA) accumulation on the surface of cancer cells. Using these factors, we developed a multivariable regression model for the five-year survival rate, as reported by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program reports, and analyzed how BA biology influences a few of these factors and causes CHOL to have a high malignancy level. RESULTS: CHOL exhibited the highest level of SA accumulation and B-cell infiltration among all cancer types studied. BAs inhibit the cell cycle progression through the receptor GPBAR1, thereby limiting the rate of nucleotide biosynthesis-which in turn forces the cells to increase SA biosynthesis in order to maintain the intracellular pH at a stable level-thereby driving cell migration and metastasis, as established in our previous study. CONCLUSIONS: BAs are the key contributors to the lowest five-year survival rate of CHOL among the seven cancer types studied here. This finding not only reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying the high malignancy level of CHOL but also provides a new potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of CHOL.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Aldolase A accelerates hepatocarcinogenesis by refactoring c-Jun transcription.",
    "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) expresses abundant glycolytic enzymes and displays comprehensive glucose metabolism reprogramming. Aldolase A (ALDOA) plays a prominent role in glycolysis; however, little is known about its role in HCC development. In the present study, we aim to explore how ALDOA is involved in HCC proliferation. HCC proliferation was markedly suppressed both in vitro and in vivo following ALDOA knockout, which is consistent with ALDOA overexpression encouraging HCC proliferation. Mechanistically, ALDOA knockout partially limits the glycolytic flux in HCC cells. Meanwhile, ALDOA translocated to nuclei and directly interacted with c-Jun to facilitate its Thr93 phosphorylation by P21-activated protein kinase; ALDOA knockout markedly diminished c-Jun Thr93 phosphorylation and then dampened c-Jun transcription function. A crucial site Y364 mutation in ALDOA disrupted its interaction with c-Jun, and Y364S ALDOA expression failed to rescue cell proliferation in ALDOA deletion cells. In HCC patients, the expression level of ALDOA was correlated with the phosphorylation level of c-Jun (Thr93) and poor prognosis. Remarkably, hepatic ALDOA was significantly upregulated in the promotion and progression stages of diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC models, and the knockdown of A ldoa strikingly decreased HCC development in vivo. Our study demonstrated that ALDOA is a vital driver for HCC development by activating c-Jun-mediated oncogene transcription, opening additional avenues for anti-cancer therapies.",

    "AbstractText": "Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are designed to minimize surgical stress, preserve physiological function, and expedite recovery through standardized perioperative care for primary colorectal surgery patients. This narrative review explores the benefits of current ERAS protocols in improving outcomes for these patients and provides insights into future advancements. Numerous studies have shown that ERAS protocols significantly reduce the length of hospital stays by several days compared to conventional care. Additionally, the implementation of ERAS is linked to a reduction in postoperative complications, including lower incidences of surgical site infections, anastomotic leaks, and postoperative ileus. Patients adhering to ERAS protocols also benefit from quicker gastrointestinal recovery, marked by an earlier return of bowel function. Some research indicates that colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery with ERAS protocols may experience improved overall survival rates. High compliance with ERAS protocols leads to better outcomes, yet achieving full adherence continues to be a challenge. Despite these advantages, implementation challenges persist, with compliance rates affected by varying clinical practices and resource availability. However, the future of ERAS looks promising with the incorporation of prehabilitation strategies and technologies such as wearable devices and telemedicine. These innovations provide real-time monitoring, enhance patient engagement, and improve postoperative follow-up, potentially transforming perioperative care in colorectal surgery and offering new avenues for enhanced patient outcomes.",

    "AbstractText": "FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is an innovative approach that delivers ultra-high dose rates exceeding 40 Gy in less than a second, aiming to widen the therapeutic window by minimizing damage to normal tissue while maintaining tumor control. This review explores the advancements, mechanisms, and clinical applications of FLASH-RT across various radiation sources. Electrons have been predominantly used due to technical feasibility, but their limited penetration depth restricts clinical application. Protons, offering deeper tissue penetration, are considered promising for treating deep-seated tumors despite challenges in beam delivery. Preclinical studies demonstrate that FLASH-RT reduces normal tissue toxicity in the lung, brain, skin, intestine, and heart without compromising antitumor efficacy. The mechanisms underlying the FLASH effect may involve oxygen depletion leading to transient hypoxia, reduced DNA damage in normal tissues, and modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. However, these mechanisms are incompletely understood, and inconsistent results across studies highlight the need for further research. Initial clinical studies, including treatment of cutaneous lymphoma and bone metastases, indicate the feasibility and potential benefits of FLASH-RT in patients. Challenges for clinical implementation include technical issues in dosimetry accuracy at ultra-high dose rates, adaptations in treatment planning systems, beam delivery methods, and economic considerations due to specialized equipment requirements. Future directions will involve comprehensive preclinical studies to optimize irradiation parameters, large-scale clinical trials to establish standardized protocols, and technological advancements to overcome limitations. FLASH-RT holds the potential to revolutionize radiotherapy by reducing normal tissue toxicity and improving therapeutic outcomes, but significant research is required for real-world clinical applications.",

    "AbstractText": "Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) offers superior dose distributions and greater biological effectiveness than conventional photon-based radiotherapy (RT). Due to its higher linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness, CIRT is particularly effective against radioresistant tumors and those located near critical organs. Since the first dedicated CIRT facility was established in Japan in 1994, CIRT has demonstrated remarkable efficacy against various malignancies, including head and neck tumors, skull base and upper cervical spine tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and bone and soft tissue sarcomas. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of CIRT, highlighting its clinical indications and future directions. According to clinical studies, CIRT achieves high local control rates with manageable toxicity across multiple cancer types. For instance, in head and neck tumors (e.g., adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucosal melanoma), CIRT has achieved local control rates exceeding 80%. In early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, CIRT has resulted in local control rates over 90% with minimal toxicity. Moreover, CIRT has shown promise in treating challenging cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, where conventional therapies are limited. Nonetheless, the global adoption of CIRT remains limited due to high costs and complexity. Future directions include conducting randomized controlled trials to establish high-level evidence, integrating new technologies such as ultrahigh-dose-rate (FLASH) therapy, and expanding CIRT facilities globally with strategic planning and cost-effectiveness analyses. If these challenges are addressed, CIRT is poised to play a transformative role in cancer treatment, improving survival rates and the quality of life.",

This review examines recent advancements in treating advanced HCC, referencing the updated 2022 HCC guidelines and the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer system. Historically, first-line systemic therapies included sorafenib and lenvatinib, with regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab serving as second-line options. Since 2020, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown superior overall survival than sorafenib, leading to the adoption of combination therapies such as atezolizumab with bevacizumab and durvalumab with tremelimumab as first-line treatments. The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that atezolizumab-bevacizumab significantly extended median overall survival and progression-free survival, with the longest survival reported in any phase 3 trial for advanced HCC. Similarly, the HIMALAYA study indicated that durvalumab combined with tremelimumab significantly improved survival rates. Second-line therapies now include regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, nivolumab with ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab, each offering benefits for specific patient populations. Nonetheless, these therapies are associated with side effects that require careful management. Traditional targeted therapies can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular events, and hand-foot skin reactions, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause immune-related adverse events affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system. Clinicians must be well-versed in these treatments and their potential side effects to provide optimal patient care. The emergence of combination therapies targeting complex biological pathways signifies a new paradigm in HCC treatment, emphasizing the importance of continuous education and vigilant monitoring to optimize patient outcomes.",

HCC exhibits significant heterogeneity at both histopathological and molecular levels, complicating its management but offering potential for personalized therapeutic approaches. This review outlines the morpho-molecular heterogeneity of HCC and summarizes various histological subtypes, including steatohepatitic, clear cell, macrotrabecular-massive, scirrhous, lymphocyte-rich, and fibrolamellar HCCs. Each subtype possesses distinct clinical, histological, and molecular features; for instance, steatohepatitic HCC is associated with metabolic dysfunction and shows IL-6/JAK/STAT activation, while clear cell HCCs often have IDH1 mutations and favorable prognosis. The macrotrabecular-massive subtype is linked to poor outcomes and TP53 mutations, whereas scirrhous HCCs express stemness markers and have TSC1/TSC2 mutations. Lymphocyte-rich HCCs are characterized by immune cell infiltration and better prognosis. CTNNB1-mutated HCCs show specific morphological features and may benefit from targeted therapies. Understanding these subtypes and associated molecular alterations is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including potential predictive biomarkers and personalized treatments. Additionally, the identification of patterns like vessels-encapsulating-tumor-clusters offers prognostic implications and may guide therapeutic decisions. Recent molecular studies have enhanced our comprehension of HCC heterogeneity, laying the groundwork for more personalized approaches. Pathologists play a vital role in recognizing these subtypes, aiding in prognosis prediction and treatment planning.

Projected to become the primary cause of HCC by 2030, MASH-HCC presents unique clinical challenges. This review examines its clinical management, including surveillance strategies and treatment advances, and discusses prospects to overcome existing challenges. MASH-HCC accounts for 10%-20% of HCC cases, particularly in Western countries, with a rising incidence due to obesity. Risk factors include cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, alcohol, smoking, genetic polymorphisms (e.g., PNPLA3), and microbiome alterations. The pathogenesis involves fibrosis, immune dysfunction (e.g., T-cell impairment), and molecular changes. Prevention focuses on lifestyle modifications. Surveillance in patients with MASH cirrhosis is crucial but is hindered by poor ultrasound sensitivity in obese patients, necessitating alternative methods. Treatment mirrors that of other HCC types, but comorbidities and potentially reduced efficacy of immunotherapy necessitate tailored approaches. MASH is becoming the leading cause of HCC, necessitating lifestyle interventions for prevention. Improved surveillance and early detection are critical but challenging due to obesity-related factors. Treatments align with those for other HCC types, but comorbidities and potential differences in immunotherapy efficacy due to T-cell dysfunction require careful consideration. Key needs include identifying molecular drivers in non-cirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, developing preventive therapies, refining surveillance methods, and tailoring treatments.

We conducted a prospective study on targeted therapy based on comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). We report molecular pathways of ERBB gene and outcomes and explored the molecular mechanism of resistance. METHODS: CGP was done for all consecutive GBC patients aged >18 years. Foundation medicines CDx and TarGT Absolute were used for analysis. Patients were enrolled from Jan 2017 till Dec 2022. Patient recruitment was done after ethics committee approval. Trastuzumab and/ or lapatinib were used as targeted therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients out of 60 had ERBB1-4 gene alteration (amplification and/or mutation) that resulted in activation of PI3K/AKT/MTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK pathways. ERBB amplification (16%) was the most common genetic aberration. Mutations in TP53, RB1, CDKs, and cyclins lead to dysregulation of cell cycle and evasion of apoptosis. A total of 50% of ERBB2-positive patients carry CDK12 amplifications. The intrinsic resistance to anti-ERBB2 therapy was primarily due to downstream activation in ERBB pathway (PIK3CA) and its crosstalk with cell cycle pathway (TP53 and CDK12), JAK/STAT, VEGF, CTNNB1, and ARID1A that are known to drive MAPK/ERK signaling. Mesenchymal epithelial transition amplification or activating mutations is mechanism of resistance to anti-ERBB2 therapy. Kinase/Juxta membrane domain mutations in ERBB family proteins are also one of the potential mechanisms of resistance. CONCLUSION: GBC is enriched with ERBB gene aberrations. Targeted therapy of ERBB pathway has shown encouraging responses. CDK12 gene amplification is a possible mechanism of resistance identified. CTRI REGISTRATION NO: CTRI/2020/05/025147.",

Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) has been tested in multiple roles in the management of cervical cancer but the evidence from India is limited. METHODS: This was a prospective, cohort pilot study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in central India. Study subjects were patients with locally advanced carcinoma cervix treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy between June 2017 and May 2018. All patients underwent pre and post-treatment SCC-Ag testing which was continued serially every 3 months for a total follow-up of 24 months. A cut-off value of 1.5 ng/ml or more was used to define a positive test. Chi-Square tests, Pearson's correlation testing and Kaplan Meier plots were used to study the association of different patient and tumour variables with the SCC-Ag levels. Test validity of serial measurements of SCC-Ag was also measured for detection of recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included. SCC-Ag levels were strongly correlated with tumour stage and presence of lymph nodal metastases. Post-treatment abnormal SCC-Ag levels were significantly associated with a poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS). Serial measurement of SCC-Ag levels proved to be a good screening tool for early detection of recurrences even before clinical symptoms or signs developed with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 91.8%. CONCLUSION: Our study has highlighted the benefits of the use of this tumour marker in the management of cervical cancer and has generated useful evidence supporting its use in prognosticating patients, guiding investigations, determining risk for recurrence, assessing tumour response and for early detection of recurrences.",

Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities. Notably, chemotherapeutic medications, immunotherapeutic agents, and photothermal therapies can now be delivered more precisely to the affected site using NP-based systems. By boosting particularity, reducing side effects, and tackling drug resistance, nanomedicine has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and ultimately advance personalized oncological care. These advancements highlight the possibilities for field growth, and future development regulations are detailed.",

    "ArticleTitle": "An overview of randomized phase III clinical trials of cancer nanomedicines.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cancer therapy has undergone significant advances in recent decades attributed to personalized medicine and targeted drug delivery. Among the promising approaches, the use of nano-based delivery systems has become a relevant approach capable of improving treatment by releasing antineoplastic drugs at the target site, improving therapeutic efficacy, minimizing cytotoxicity in healthy tissues, and ultimately, reducing the intensity of adverse effects of chemotherapy. This study prospectively evaluated the impact of formulating anti-neoplastic drugs as nanomedicines on clinical response, overall survival, safety, and quality of life of cancer patients, based on the outcomes of randomized clinical trials. METHODS: A literature review was carried out by systematically searching the PubMed/MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) databases for phase III clinical trials, comparing nanomedicines with conventional therapies for the treatment of various cancer types. RESULTS: The nanomedicines analyzed were those that are approved and used in Brazil, considering the country's emerging market for advanced cancer treatments. From a total of 303 articles found, 26 articles were selected for systematic review. Studies showed that PEGylated l-asparaginase achieved a similar therapeutic effect to that of l-asparaginase, with fewer applications due to its longer half-life. Paclitaxel bound to albumin improved therapeutic efficacy as well as reduced infusion time and solvent-related toxicity of the conventional paclitaxel formulation. PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin showed better pharmacokinetics, reduced cardiotoxicity, and improved quality of life in cancer patients compared to that of free doxorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the scientific evidence of the added value of nanomedicines to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity in patients under chemotherapy.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Human behaviors and tumors go hand in hand. The wave of globalization has brought about a global homogenization of human behaviors, which further triggers a potential global human behavior-related cancer burden (HBRCB) convergence. METHODS: This study systematically evaluated the global, regional, and national metrics of HBRCBs over the last 30 years using data from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2019 results and the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository. RESULTS: The results showed the global remission and convergence of HBRCB in the last three decades and the foreseeable future (2020-2044). Overall, HBRCBs are decreasing with the global emphasis on positive dietary habits, safe sex, substance addiction withdrawal, and active physical exercise habits. Globally, from 1990 to 2019, with the development of social development index (SDI) level from 0.511 to 0.651, the HBRCBs had been decreasing from 1507.908 to 1145.344 in age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (ASDALY) and from 61.467 to 49.449 in (age-standardized death rates) ASDR per 100,000 population with changes of -24.04 % and -19.55 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the variance in HBRCBs among countries and territories generally showed a decreasing or flat trend. The variance of HBRCBs among 204 countries and territories in 2019-2044 decreased from 1495.210 to 449.202 in males and from 214.640 to 78.848 in females for ASDR due to all behavior risks, and from 911,211.676 to 317,233.590 in males and from 146,171.660 to 62,926.660 in females for ASDALY. The global HBRCBs was becoming more uniform due to the globalization of human behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the significance of addressing HBRCBs as a uniform and continuous issue in future global health promotion. It also demonstrated the potential existence of a chain effect in global health, where globalization leads to human behavior homogenization, which in turn results in HBRCB convergence. Properly measuring the commonalities and individualities among different regions and finding a balance when designing and evaluating HBRCB-related global policies in the global convergence trend of HBRCBs will be major concerns in the future.",

    "ArticleTitle": "SenSet, a novel human lung senescence cell gene signature, identifies cell-specific senescence mechanisms.",
    "AbstractText": "Cellular senescence is a major hallmark of aging. Senescence is defined as an irreversible growth arrest observed when cells are exposed to a variety of stressors including DNA damage, oxidative stress, or nutrient deprivation. While senescence is a well-established driver of aging and age-related diseases, it is a highly heterogeneous process with significant variations across organisms, tissues, and cell types. The relatively low abundance of senescence in healthy aged tissues represents a major challenge to studying senescence in a given organ, including the human lung. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning framework to generate a comprehensive senescence marker gene list in human lungs (termed SenSet) using the largest publicly available single-cell lung dataset, the Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA). We validated SenSet in a highly complex ex vivo human 3D lung tissue culture model subjected to the senescence inducers bleomycin, doxorubicin, or irradiation, and established its sensitivity and accuracy in characterizing senescence. Using SenSet, we identified and validated cell-type specific senescence signatures in distinct lung cell populations upon aging and environmental exposures. Our study presents the first comprehensive analysis of senescent cells in the healthy aging lung and uncovers cell-specific gene signatures of senescence, presenting fundamental implications for our understanding of major lung diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma.",

    "AbstractText": "The primary objective of orthopedic oncologists is to perform bone tumor surgeries with tumor-free margins for malignant tumors and complete clearance of benign bone diseases. The functional outcome depends on the salvage of important structures and optimal reconstruction of the bony defect. On-going advances in technology have helped in 3-dimensional templating of patient's anatomy and real-time tracking of instruments during surgery. Computer navigation system joins patients' imaging information to real-time anatomy by using tracking and registration of pre- and/or intra-operative acquired images. We share our experience with 15 navigation-assisted surgeries performed at a single institute. We used BrainLab navigation system coupled with the Ziehm vision RFD 3D C-arm for intra-op registration in our cases. Our study did not compare the accuracy of the resection with the intended plan using imaging in all cases; however, margins were negative in all malignant cases. These patients were followed up for a short period. Multicenter comparative studies with longer follow-ups are required to establish their clinical effectiveness. Current evidence suggests that this technology may be applicable in challenging anatomical locations and joint/physis preserving tumor surgery to achieve precise resections or curettages that accurately match intended resection plans.",

    "ArticleTitle": "To Assess the Predictive and Prognostic Role of PD-L1 and CD8 Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), introduced in 1970 for inoperable tumors, has become the standard treatment approach in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Pathological complete response (pCR) following NACT is an important indicator for disease-free survival. An increased number of CD8-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor center is thought to indicate an effective antitumor-immune response. Aberrant expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) allows tumor cells to escape the host immune system. Change in PD-L1 expression may serve as an indirect indicator to assess the response to NACT. The residual cancer burden (RCB) category defined by routine histopathological evaluation represents the extent of residual disease and may predict disease-free survival. In this study, we assessed the expression of PD-L1 and CD8 in pre- and post-NACT specimens and their role in predicting pathological response to NACT. This study was conducted for a period of 3 years at Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences, Saifai. PD-L1 and CD8 expression was compared on pre- and post-NACT tissue specimens. Pathological response to NACT was assessed by the RCB system. A total of 62 cases were evaluated. The mean age of patients was 47.58 ± 11.16 years. Six (9.7%) patients achieved pCR (RCB-0). PD-L1 and CD8 expression was found to be positively associated with pathological response (P < 0.001 for both). Tumors with negative PD-L1 (OR = 0.02) and pre-NACT intermediate/low expression of CD8 in TILs (OR = 0.11) are less likely to show a response to NACT. Prognostic role of PD-L1 and CD8 was also assessed by the Nottingham prognostic index (NPI). The expression of PD-L1 and CD8-positive TILs correlate with response to chemotherapy. High PD-L1 and CD8-positive TILs may predict better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: Prospective data on outcome of variant histology bladder cancer is scarce. We compared the neoadjuvant chemotherapy usage and oncological outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for variant versus pure urothelial histology bladder cancer. This was a retrospective comparative cohort study. Data was collected from the electronic database of our hospital from June 2009 to June 2018. Two hundred forty-one patients underwent radical cystectomy in the study period. Patients were divided into two groups (Group A - variant histology bladder cancer and Group B - pure urothelial histology). The primary outcome was overall survival. The secondary outcomes included recurrence free survival and complications. Of the 241 patients, 41 had variant histology. Histological variants were sarcomatoid (11), sarcoma (4), squamous cell (8), neuroendocrine (3), adenocarcinoma (8), and others (7). The median age was 59 years in both groups. The median duration of follow-up in Groups A and B was 12.5 and 24 months, respectively. NACT was given in 12 and 14% (Groups A and B). The median overall survival in Groups A and B was 24 (95% CI 14-33) and 40 months (95% CI 29-50), respectively (95% CI 25-50) (p = 0.12). The median OS trend is better with chemotherapy among both VH (NACT vs no NACT: not reached and 24 months) and UC (NACT vs no NACT: 40 and 36 months) groups. Margin positivity rate was significantly higher in Group A (12%) compared to Group B (3%) (p < 0.03). The recurrence free survival in Groups A and B was 16(CI 3-28) and 38(CI 23-52) months, respectively (p = 0.06). There was no difference in post-operative complications (Clavien Dindo) between the two groups (p = 0.59). Variant histology bladder cancers exhibit an aggressive behavior with early recurrences and a poorer overall survival compared to pure urothelial bladder cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy tends to improve survival in both groups. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13193-024-02138-y.",

Retrospective cohort analysis was carried out between January 2011 and December 2018 for patients with vulvar SCC who underwent primary surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the estimation of the probability of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate analyses based on the Cox proportional hazards model were performed to identify factors associated with DFS and OS. A p-value ≤ 0.05 in a two-tailed test was considered statistically significant. The study population included 81 patients; the median follow-up time for the entire cohort was 41 months. Recurrence was noted in 27 cases (33.3%), and the median time to recurrence was 36.14 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 40.8 months, and disease-free survival (DFS) was 36 months. On univariate analysis, depth of invasion (DOI), close margin, presence of lympho-vascular space invasion (LVSI), perineural invasion (PNI), groin metastases, and not receiving adjuvant therapy were significantly associated with increased recurrence rates. Deeper stromal invasion, presence of LVSI, groin node metastases, and recurrent disease were associated with poor OS on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, DOI, tumor-free margin (TFM), and PNI were significantly associated with DFS, and a previous history of recurrence was associated with OS. Vulvar cancers are relatively rare tumors with several local tumor factors such as TFM, DOI, LVSI, and lymph node status which may help determine oncological outcomes. Larger studies will definitely help establish more evidence.",

Majority of the patients are presenting in an advanced stage and are frequently showing triple negative phenotype. Additionally, in India, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) prevalence is much higher in comparison to the western world. We undertook this study with an aim to characterize TNBC based on a panel of immunohistochemical markers to explore their pathogenesis, behavior, treatment response, and outcomes in respect to disease progression, disease-free survival, and death. The study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee which included 63 TNBC cases for evaluating expression of GATA3 and p53. Basal cell markers were done only in GATA3 negative cases. The IHC markers were correlated with different clinical profile, demographic factors, and outcome. A total of 63 patients were included in the study out of which 37 patients had disease-free survival; 8 patients showed disease progression; and 18 patients died. Among the patients, 29 were GATA positive. Out of those 29 patients, 15 were also p53 positive. Among 34 GATA3 negative cases, 32 showed expression of at least one basal cytokeratin marker, and 13 were also showed p53 expression. Among clinical factors tumor size (OR = 0.37; 0.15-0.81; P = 0.01), and tumors of grade III (OR = 0.02; 0.001-0.22; P = 0.004) showed significant association with reduced survival. BLBC forms a major part of TNBCs in the Indian patients. High tumor grade and large tumor size were significantly associated with reduced disease-free survival. Among immunohistochemistry markers, GATA3 positivity, GATA3 negative with p53 positivity, and CK positive with p53 positive cases showed decreased survival, however, the results were not statistically significant.

This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of multivisceral resection in advanced EOC, focusing on the effect of surgical complexity on post-operative morbidity, time to adjuvant treatment, and overall survival. This single-arm study included 74 patients with advanced EOC who underwent multivisceral resection between January 2018 and December 2021 at the Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. The study introduced a modified version of Aletti's Surgical Complexity Scoring system to classify surgeries as intermediate or high complexity. Post-operative morbidity was assessed using the Clavien-Dindo scoring system. Time to adjuvant treatment and overall survival were also analyzed. Of the 74 patients, 80% underwent intermediate complexity surgeries, while 20% had high complexity procedures. Major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo grades 3 and 4) occurred in 10.9% of patients, with no significant difference between intermediate and high complexity surgeries (p = 0.86). Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated within 6 weeks for 89.2% of patients. The overall 12-month and 18-month survival probabilities were 94% and 85%, respectively. Complete cytoreduction (CC-0) was achieved in 93.3% of cases, with significantly lower mortality rates compared to non-CC-0 cases (18.8% vs. 60%). Multivisceral resection in advanced EOC demonstrates favorable outcomes with acceptable morbidity rates, regardless of surgical complexity. The high rate of complete cytoreduction and impressive survival probabilities underscore the potential benefits of aggressive surgical approaches in advanced EOC. Although the subset analysis favored primary cytoreduction, further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings and explore the impact of primary versus interval debulking surgery on long-term outcomes.",

These tumours have been divided into patterns of infiltration, namely expansile and infiltrative types, which in turn have prognostic significance. A hospital-based, retrospective analytical cohort study was conducted at a tertiary cancer center in Northeast India, from September 2019 to September 2023. The objectives were to study the impact of pattern of infiltration on oncological outcomes and to prognosticate them. Histology slides of the diagnosed cases were re-examined according to WHO protocol. Overall incidence of pMOC in our study was 3.3% (32/958 patients). Review of histology slides excluded 8 cases. The expansile pattern was seen in 71.9% (n = 23), and infiltrative pattern in 28.1% (n = 9). The most common presenting stage at diagnosis was IA in both expansile (30.4%, n = 7) and infiltrative (44.4%, n = 9) types. Intraoperative frozen section was used in 7 cases with a concordance rate of 14.2% (n = 1). Recurrence was observed in 11 patients (infiltrative = 55.5%, n = 5; expansile = 26%, n = 6). The median recurrence-free interval (RFI) was 28 months in the expansile group and 21 months in the infiltrative group. All recurrences were intra-peritoneal, most common in the pelvis (45.5%), followed by omento-peritoneal (18.2%). Lymphadenectomy was carried out in 56.2% (n = 18) patients (infiltrative = 88.8%, n = 8; expansile = 43.7%, n = 10); in 1 case of infiltrative type, it was reported as positive. Infiltrative histology was associated with more recurrences and lower median survival. Peritoneal staging adds to the quality of surgery; however, the role of lymphadenectomy needs careful consideration.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose supplementation on blood transfusion rates and hemoglobin levels in anemic epithelial ovarian cancer patients from intervention to 3 months after the last chemotherapy cycle. Sixty-nine patients with diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer with hemoglobin levels ≤ 10 g/dl were randomized in a parallel-group randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institute. All-stage epithelial ovarian cancer patients who were on ≤ 3rd cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy after primary cytoreductive surgery or who underwent interval cytoreductive surgery after receiving ≤ 3 neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included. The intervention group received one 1000-mg dose of ferric carboxymaltose intravenously while the control group received 100 mg ferrous ascorbate orally twice daily for 3 months. The oncologic treatment plan in both groups remained unchanged. Biochemical parameters for iron deficiency anemia (ferritin, total iron binding capacity, iron, and C-reactive protein) were recorded at enrolment. Complete blood count was monitored before intervention and at 3 months of the last chemotherapy cycle. The time frame to evaluate the response of both groups was from inclusion in the study to 3 months from the last chemotherapy cycle.

    "AbstractText": "The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend active surveillance (AS) as an alternative for very low-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) based on evidence from observational and cohort studies in Japan and Korea that demonstrated low rates of disease progression. Adopting AS presents unique challenges in India given the need for proper understanding, adequate sonographic expertise, meticulous follow-up and acceptance of the patients and clinicians for active surveillance of diagnosed PTC. We present our data on the feasibility of AS at our centre in the last 7 years. We started adopting AS for patients with PTC or suspected PTC under AS in July 2017. Most of the patients had FNAC category Bethesda V or VI and/or USG category ACR-TIRADS TR4 or TR5 nodules. In all patients, the PTC was discovered incidentally. A baseline CT scan of the neck and chest was performed if indicated and in select patients, serial serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) were done. Patients were followed up semi-annually with neck ultrasound performed by a single operator. We have been following 17 patients with PTC under the AS clinic. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 45.17 (14.7) years with 13 females and a median follow-up of 40 months (IQR 40-46; range 13-86), and none have undergone thyroid surgery. The PTC was discovered incidentally in 12 patients during a neck sonogram for evaluation of painful swallowing or salivary gland-related symptoms and evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism; 2 patients on CT chest for pulmonary symptoms and 3 were \"PETomas\" during evaluation of their primary cancer (colon cancer, breast cancer and multiple myeloma). Out of the 3 patients who underwent FDG-PET scan, the SUV max of the PTC was 4, 4.8 and 14.6. All except one were uni-focal PTC with size (largest dimension on USG) ranging from 4.8 to 21 mm and median volume 0.21 mL (IQR 0.21-0.37 mL). The baseline median Tg levels were 12.95 ng/mL (range is 0.07 to 51 ng/mL), and anti-Tg was elevated in 4 patients (132 IU/mL, 156 IU/mL, 696 IU/mL, 4000 IU/mL). Serial Tg and anti Tg levels were measured over time in 4 patients. The patient with the largest PTC (21 mm) who is currently under AS had Eisenmenger syndrome. The longest duration of follow-up in the AS cohort is 86 months. One patient conceived and had a healthy baby during active surveillance with no significant increase in the size of the tumour. On follow-up, the volume change in the nodules ranged from - 44 to 335% with 35% (6/17) showing decrement and 65% (11/17) showing increment. The change in the largest dimension ranged from - 28 to 154% with a decrement of 41% (7/17) and increment of 59% (10/17). However, a significant increase in the volume (> 50%) was noted only in 2 patients, and a significant increase in tumour dimension (> 3 mm) was documented in only 2 patients on follow-up. None of the patients has developed regional or distant metastasis, and none has undergone surgery. Our study provides insights into the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with incidentally diagnosed PTC undergoing active surveillance. Our findings support the feasibility and safety of this approach in select individuals, with emphasis on meticulous periodic neck sonography by a single operator, and a like-minded supportive thyroid cancer team.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Molecular diagnostics are critical for informing cancer patient care. In Ireland, the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) develops cancer therapy regimens, which include relevant information on molecular indications. Here, we present a collated overview of the current molecular indications of all NCCP systemic anti-cancer therapy regimens and the funding statuses of their associated drugs. Furthermore, we also provide estimates for the scale of required molecular testing in cancer therapy and for the clinical genetic sequencing capacity of Ireland, and provide a summary of current cancer clinical trials in Ireland which have molecular components. METHODS: Through a combination of web scraping, keyword search, and manual review, we performed a full review of all 856 indications included in the 533 therapy regimens published to date by the NCCP to identify therapy indications with explicit molecular criteria. For all cancer types identified in these indications, we obtained incidence rates in Ireland from National Cancer Registry Ireland to predict the number of patients yearly who stand to benefit from a molecular test. We then applied molecular subtype rates from published literature to estimate the number of patients who would then qualify for a relevant molecularly guided therapy. RESULTS: We identified 246 indications for 175 NCCP therapy regimens that include molecular criteria. These 246 molecular indications encompassed 101 genetic criteria, 161 cellular biomarker criteria, 63 molecularly informed drugs, and over 20 cancer types. We estimated that up to approximately 55% of cancer patients in Ireland could qualify for a molecular test and that the majority of tested patients would qualify for a treatment informed by a molecular test. CONCLUSIONS: As personalised cancer medicine continues to develop in Ireland, this study will provide a baseline understanding of current practices. We anticipate that work such as this will help to inform planning in the healthcare system.",

    "AbstractText": "It is well established that reciprocal communication between cancer cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in cancer progression and therapy response. There are multiple ways by which cells communicate, including direct cell-cell contact and the secretion of soluble mediators. The secretome of cancer cells contains valuable information to disentangle the complex conversation that is happening between cancer cells and neighboring or distant cells such as immune cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Here, we provide a workflow of mapping the cancer cell secretome in an unbiased way using amino acid-analog labeling in combination with mass spectrometry. The generation of single cells from fresh tumors, isolation of primary cancer cells from a complex multi-cellular pool, and the detection of newly synthesized proteins that are secreted into the medium is described in detailed protocols. Using this experimental pipeline the secretome of cancer cells across different tumors can be determined, paving the way to unravel cell-cell communication networks in the tumor microenvironment, which may uncover novel therapeutic targets.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Isolation of tumor interstitial fluid for metabolic determinations.",
    "AbstractText": "Neoplastic cells are characterized by alterations in metabolic pathways, typically leading to an aberrant use of glycolysis even under aerobic conditions - a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. One consequence of this metabolic shift is the production of lactate, an oncometabolite often found at elevated levels in tumors. Lactate not only fuels the growth of cancer cells but also promotes angiogenesis, immune escape, and metastasis, thereby contributing to tumor progression and resistance to therapy. This highlights the importance of lactate in cancer metabolism and underscores the need for methods to measure it. In this study, we describe various centrifugation and elution protocols to isolate interstitial fluid and measure lactate in experimental tumors. These tumors were generated in immunocompetent mice using the MC38 colon cancer cell line. We propose that, with minor modifications, the methods here described could be successfully adapted for use with tumors originating from other human or murine cell lines. Furthermore, these methods could potentially enable the detection of other oncometabolites in the tumor microenvironment, which could have significant implications for both basic research and therapeutic strategies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Establishing Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) reporter cell lines for cancer immunology and therapeutic applications.",
    "AbstractText": "Tyro-3, Axl, and Mertk (abbreviated TAM receptors or TAMs), have well established functions in efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic cells are engulfed by phagocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. In addition to their roles in efferocytosis, TAMs are also pleiotropic immune modulators that dampen inflammation and promote immune resolution and tolerance. Mice lacking one or more of the TAM receptors in various murine models leads to chronic inflammation and in some cases autoimmunity and chronic disease. In recent years, TAMs have emerged as important contributors in cancer, functioning both as oncogenic tyrosine kinases as well as immune modulators. Many recent studies indicate that TAM inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies, kinase inhibitors, decoy receptors and ligands, and small molecular wedge inhibitors have therapeutic potential in cancer biology and immunotherapy. Here, we report the development and characterization of two type of TAM reporter lines that can be adapted to screen a wide range of TAM inhibitor types. The first involves TAM-IFN-γR1 chimeric CHO lines, where the extracellular domain of human TAM receptors is fused with the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains of the human IFN-γ receptor chain. The second type of TAM reporter line described is the EGFR-TAM chimeric CHO lines, which involves fusing the extracellular domain of the EGFR receptor with the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains and cytosolic tail of TAM receptors. With minimal adaptation, both lines can be adopted for high throughput screening with immune-oncology applications.",

    "AbstractText": "Patient-derived tumor models are emerging as promising tools to explore patient-specific tumor behavior and to address a central gap in tumor immunology and immunotherapy drug development - the need for clinically relevant tumor models that recapitulate the complexity of the human tumor ecosystem, in which cancer cells are interacting with various immune and stromal elements. Patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS), a biomimetic 3D-patient tumor avatar (3D-PTA), are comprised of cancer cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating immune and stromal cells that are grown within collagen hydrogels embedded in a 3D microfluidic culture device to model physiologic conditions and enable the study of tumor-immune dynamics. PDOTS and their murine counterparts (MDOTS, murine-derived organotypic tumor spheroids) are responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and mirror in vivo response dynamics. We have also confirmed the utility of MDOTS/PDOTS in examining novel therapeutic strategies to overcome ICB resistance and testing the efficiency of T cell-based immunotherapies, demonstrating the utility of PDOTS profiling in examining the tumor-immune dynamics of immunotherapy response and resistance. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for processing, ex vivo culture, and analysis of patient-derived tumor organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) in 3D microfluidic culture for immuno-oncology applications. The protocol can be readily adapted for ex vivo profiling of murine-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (MDOTS) and cancer cell line-derived monotypic tumor spheroids (MTS) for robust and iterative testing of immuno-oncology targets.",

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between tumor budding (TB), which is the earliest histological indicator of tumor spread and represents epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and prognostic factors as well as the effect of TB on survival in patients with IBC-NST, thereby demonstrating its potential prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 278 cases of breast resection diagnosed with IBC-NST from 2014 to 2019. Total tumor buds were counted in 10 high-power fields of a hematoxylin and eosin-stained section with the most infiltrative area at 400× magnification. The cutoff value for TB was obtained using receiver operating characteristic analysis for mortality and recurrence risk; this cutoff value was used to classify TB into two categories: low and high grades. The relationship between TB and prognostic factors and the effect of TB on the survival of patients were investigated. RESULTS: This study revealed a statistically significant relationship between high-grade TB and increased tumor size, advanced pathological primary tumor (pT) category, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, blood vessel invasion, increased recurrence, and mortality as well as reduced overall and disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: TB in breast carcinomas may have significant predictive value for prognosis. It emerges as a simple, reproducible, and cost-effective histological marker. With the standardization of evaluation criteria, TB may be readily integrated into routine pathological examination, thereby increasing its value in clinical patient management.",

Computational methods have been widely explored and have become increasingly accurate in recent years. However, the clinical application of prediction methods is still in its infancy due to large discrepancies between preclinial models and patients. We present a novel disentangled synthesis transfer network (DiSyn) for drug response prediction specifically designed for transfer learning from preclinical models to clinical patients. DiSyn uses a domain separation network (DSN) to disentangle drug response related features, employs data synthesis technology to increase the sample size and iteratively trains for better feature disentanglement. DiSyn is pretrained on large-scale unlabeled cancer samples and validated by three datasets, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging And moLecular Analysis 2 (I-SPY2) and Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research Patient-Derived Xenograft Encyclopedia (NIBR PDXE), achieving competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods on cancer patients and mice. Furthermore, the application of DiSyn to thousands of breast cancer patients show the heterogeneity in drug responses and demonstrate its potential value in biomarker discovery and drug combination prediction.",

The World Health Assembly has set goals for HBV elimination by 2030, aiming for a >90% reduction in incidence and a 65% reduction in deaths compared to 2015. However, as of 2023, no countries were on track to achieve these targets. In Canada, challenges in HBV elimination persist due to the lack of a universal birth dose vaccine and interprovincial disparities in screening and care linkage. The Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL) and the Canadian Hepatitis B Network hosted the Inaugural Progress toward Hepatitis B Elimination Meeting in Calgary, Alberta, Canada (September 29, 2023 to October 1, 2023). This collaborative platform brought together national and international clinicians, laboratory providers, public health researchers, policymakers, and community-based organizations interested in HBV and hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) / HBV coinfection. The workshop was held during the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation (September 30, 2023) to commemorate the tragic legacy of residential schools in Canada, and it highlighted the need to promote meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Key outcomes of the summit included establishing objectives for HBV elimination, advocating for adherence to global targets, universal screening and birth dose vaccination, equitable access to antiviral treatment across all provinces/territories, and addressing special populations. This overview highlights the presentations and emphasizes the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, public health agencies, and government entities to strive for HBV elimination in Canada.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare and potentially fatal cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The classic Chiari's triad of symptoms and typical endoscopic findings are not present in all patients, making diagnosis challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: An 86-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room for melena and hematemesis with hemodynamic instability. He had a previous hospitalization for cardioembolic stroke complicated by hematemesis of unknown etiology after initiation of anticoagulation (which was suspended), being discharged on aspirin. His medical history also included hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and prostate cancer. On upper endoscopy, no lesions were found, despite the presence of a large non-mobilizable clot in the gastric fundus. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and, on the next day, reassessment esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal. On the eighth day of hospitalization, the patient presented with hemorrhagic shock due to new-onset hematemesis. Upper endoscopy revealed an esophageal 10-mm non-ulcerated mucosal depression with a visible vessel at 20 cm from the incisors, closed with 3 hemoclips. Thoracic CT angiography showed a brachiocephalic trunk aneurysm with aortoesophageal fistulization. He was deemed unsuitable for endovascular or surgical treatment. About 2 months later, the patient was admitted to the emergency room in cardiorespiratory arrest following an episode of hematemesis at home. DISCUSSION: This report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity of AEF. Endoscopic treatment can be the main therapy in patients without indication for vascular intervention. The purpose was to palliate new bleeding episodes, maintaining a very poor prognosis.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Little has been written about the role of COVID assessment centres set up during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive study reviewed and compared COVID cases presenting to the Mount Sinai Hospital COVID assessment centre and emergency departments over a 4-month period at the start of the pandemic in 2020. RESULTS: Of 185 COVID-positive presentations, 115 (62.2%) were assessed in the COVID assessment centre and 70 (37.8%) in the emergency department. Patients seen in the COVID assessment centre tended to be younger (mean age 33.5 years) than in the emergency department (mean age 51.8 years, P < .001), had fewer comorbidities (P ≤ .05 for hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and cancer), and were less likely to have shortness of breath, fever, or focal lung findings (P < .01 for all). Chest imaging was ordered for 57.1% of emergency department cases versus 0% for COVID assessment centre cases (P < .001). Overall, 21 out of 69 (30.4%) COVID-positive cases were admitted from the emergency department, while all COVID assessment centre cases were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: The Mount Sinai COVID assessment centre assessed the majority of COVID cases early on in the pandemic at this site.

In this work, we selected carbon dots (CDs) and new indocyanine green (IR820) as building units to fabricate a smart nanotheranostics (CDs-IR820 assembly) with the characteristics of controlled release and real-time imaging to solve the time gap between diagnosis and treatment. The fabricated CDs-IR820 assembly locked the photosensitivity of the CDs and could degrade under 750 nm laser irradiation to achieve controlled release of the CDs, thus used for cell imaging and producing single oxygen under the white light. Besides, the released CDs could migrate from the mitochondria to the nucleus during the PDT process, indicating the cell activity, which facilitated the regulation of treatment parameters to achieve the precise PDT for cancer.",

It investigated the effects of apple aroma on cardiac and peripheral autonomic nervous system activity under stressful conditions. METHODS: Within-subject experiments were conducted with 25 healthy male university students with a 30-minute calculation task under three conditions: Apple, Chamomile (CHA), and Di propylene glycol (DPG) (scentless air). The aroma administration was precisely controlled and counterbalanced. Cardiac activity on electrocardiograms and nose tip temperature were recorded throughout the experiment. A visual analog scale and a scent questionnaire were subjective measures. RESULTS: Apple aroma demonstrated a significantly smaller increase in heart rate (t [24] = 3.36, p = 0.008 vs. DPG, t [24] = 4.06, p = 0.001 vs. CHA), and a decrease in the high-frequency component of heart rate variability (t [24] = 2.81, p = 0.029 vs. DPG, t [24] = 3.48, p = 0.006 vs. CHA) compared to the other conditions, representing a smaller enhancement of cardiac sympathetic nervous system activity and smaller suppression of cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity respectively.

In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical-demographic characteristics of C. parapsilosis candidemia and the antifungal susceptibility profile of C. parapsilosis in pediatric patients with hematological and solid organ malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included pediatric patients with hematologic and solid organ malignancies presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with candidemia, in whom C. parapsilosis was isolated from blood and catheter cultures between January 2010 and August 2023. RESULTS: Thirty (65.2%) of the patients had hematologic and 16 (34.8%) had solid organ malignancies. In all patients, 23 (50%) had non-catheter-related candidemia and 23 (50%) had catheter-related candidemia. At least one of the risk factors examined was detected in these patients. Catheter-related candidemia was found to be more common in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancy. The difference was found to be statistically significant (p= 0.030). Drug resistance rates of C. parapsilosis were 6.5% for amphotericin B, 6.5% for fluconazole, 2.2% for voriconazole and 2.2% for micafungin. No patient with caspofungin resistance was detected. The mean treatment duration of the patients was 21 days (min 3-max 103) and it was observed that amphotericin B and caspofungin were used most frequently in the treatment regimen. The mortality rate of patients with candidemia was 6.5%. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that patients with hematologic malignancies exhibited a higher susceptibility to catheter-related C. parapsilosis candidemia compared to patients with solid organ tumors. Caspofungin resistance was not detected in our study, and we believe that each center should know its own antifungal drug sensitivity, determine the treatment regimen accordingly, and that catheters should be removed rapidly in patients with catheter-related C. parapsilosis candidemia in malignant patients.",

Thus far, only a few dozen cases of localized mosaic neurofibromatosis have undergone combined germline and somatic genetic testing for the NF1 gene. METHODS: A 65-year-old female patient was referred to our center for multiple neurofibromas on her right shoulder, with a clinical diagnosis of localized mosaic neurofibromatosis. One of the neurofibromas was surgically removed. Massively parallel sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were utilized to identify the germline and somatic variants in the NF1 gene. RESULTS: The heterozygous pathogenic NF1 gene variant c.7549C>T and multiple heterozygous intragenic NF1 gene deletions were detected in the DNA taken from the shoulder neurofibroma, but not in the DNA from blood leukocytes or buccal smear. STUDY LIMITATIONS: The healthy skin around neurofibromas was not analyzed due to limited available material. CONCLUSION: Germline and somatic genetic testing in localized forms of neurofibromatosis are advisable since this facilitates proper genetic counseling regarding risks to offspring, who could inherit a germline pathogenic variant. Another important point to consider is cancer surveillance, which is often underutilized in mosaic forms of neurofibromatosis.",

    "AbstractText": "Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a key diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), interacting with Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways related to cancer proliferation. Modulating GPC3 gene expression can induce liver cancer cell death by disrupting growth factor signaling, cell adhesion, and metabolic regulation. This study presents the development of a non-viral ultralarge porous CRISPR-Cas9 silica nano-depot to perform targeted GPC3 genome editing for the treatment of HCC. The synthesized ultralarge porous silica nano-depot (UPSND) encapsulates substantial CRISPR-Cas9-ribonucleoprotein complexes with a remarkable 98.3% loading efficiency. The UPSND-mediated GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 therapy significantly suppresses cancer cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt and Hippo/YAP pathways. The efficiency of GPC3 gene deletion is observed to be 5.1-fold higher than that of commercial lipid-based GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9 in both human and murine genes, with minimal off-target effects. In vivo systemic administration of GPC3 Cas9-RNP@UPSND resulted in preferential accumulation within hepatic tissues in orthotopic HCC mouse models, leading to complete tumor eradication and enhancing T-cell tumor-infiltration. Furthermore, the GPC3 CRISPR-Cas9@UPSND treatment exhibits superior anti-proliferative efficacy in tumor-growth prevention compared to Codrituzumab, as evidenced by the analysis of Ki67 and GPC3 expression, along with serum GPC3 levels. These findings underscore the translational potential of the non-viral UPSND nanoplatform-based CRISPR GPC3 genome editing, offering a promising targeted therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.",

The prefabrication reinforced the vascularity of the long conduit by the delay effect. The prefabrication included skin grafting on the resultant raw surface; hence, another free flap to seal the longitudinal suture line of the conduit was avoided. Furthermore, the viability of the conduit was easily monitored with the previously grafted skin. However, if a high-positioned jejunostomy is unavailable, an additional free skin tube might be necessary.

Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, and Xylaria feejeensis were isolated from B. myriadea, while Xylaria psidii, Daldinia eschscholtzii, and Nodulisporium sp. were obtained from A. antillarum. The ethyl acetate extracts of these ELFs were screened for cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 cell line, with P. chrysosporium extract showing potent cytotoxicity. The purified compounds from this extract were identified as spirolaxine (1), phanerosporic acid (2), and 5-(14-hydroxypentadecyl)-resorcinol (3). Their structures were determined using Fourier Transform Infrared, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution mass spectrometry, while their absolute configurations were established through circular dichroism and time-dependent density functional theory calculations. The compounds demonstrated moderate cytotoxic activity against human breast (MCF-7), oral (CAL-27), and lung (A549) cancer cell lines.

METHOD: This was a descriptive cross-sectional design based on a retrospective review of records of WLWH who were screened for hrHPV infection. We assessed the prevalence of hrHPV infection during the study period. RESULTS: We included data for 2745 women who had an hrHPV DNA test. The median age at the time of testing was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR]; 37-52) The median duration on HIV ART was 10.2 years (IQR: 6.2-13.3). The proportion of women with undetectable viral loads (< 50 copies/mL) was 91.2%. The prevalence of hrHPV infection was 53%. The most prevalent genotypes were human papillomavirus (HPV) 58 (11%), HPV 52 (10%), HPV 35 (10%), and HPV 16 (9%). CONCLUSION: Our study reports a high prevalence of HPV and hrHPV including other subtypes than 16 and 18. These results highlight the continued importance of CC screening and prophylactic HPV vaccinations among WLWH.",

    "ArticleTitle": "XPR1 promotes ovarian cancer growth and regulates MHC-I through autophagy.",
    "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have a poor effect in treating ovarian cancer, and the specific mechanism is unknown. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of XPR1 on controlling autophagy in ovarian cancer. The findings suggested an increase in XPR1 expression in ovarian cancer tissues. The elevated level of its expression was linked to the stage of ovarian cancer, as well as overall survival and progression-free survival. XPR1 enhanced the growth and spread of ovarian cancer while suppressing autophagy. Moreover, XPR1 suppressed autophagy flux by interacting with LAMP1 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. XPR1 controlled the positioning and production of MHC-I molecules on the surfaces of ovarian cancer cells via autophagy. Silencing XPR1 combined with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine significantly inhibited tumor growth in mouse ovarian cancer models. In conclusion, the findings indicate that XPR1 could serve as a promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. Combined autophagy inhibitors may improve the sensitivity of ovarian cancer immunotherapy.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The mechanisms driving the transition from hepatitis to cirrhosis, and eventually, to HCC are unclear. This study aimed to clarify the metabolic changes that underly the progression of HCC and identify potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers. METHODS: This prospective study collected serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC, hospitalized at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, from December 2022 to December 2023. The samples were analyzed using non-targeted, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis modeling and t-tests were used to identify key differentially expressed metabolites associated with the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the key metabolic pathways involved, while machine learning models were applied to identify the metabolite signatures. RESULTS: We identified 153 differentially expressed metabolites in the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC, many of which were involved in ammonia cycling or the metabolism of methylhistidine, alanine, arginine, proline, or betaine. We also identified L-histidine and adenosine as the metabolites that demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing among the hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our study comprehensively characterized the metabolic profiles of the different stages of the hepatitis-cirrhosis-HCC transition. We showed that serum metabolite detection is a viable diagnostic tool for identifying and monitoring high-risk individuals, which could potentially be used to halt the development of HCC.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Association of cancer and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between 2020 and 2023.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. A strong correlation has been found between COVID-19 treatment outcomes and noncommunicable diseases such as cancers. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cancer patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an analysis on data collected in a large prospective cohort study set-up by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). All patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cancer was defined as having a current solid organ or haematological malignancy. The following outcomes were assessed; 30-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospitalization and receipt of higher-level care. RESULTS: Of the 560,547 hospitalised individuals who were analysed, 27,243 (4.9%) had cancer. Overall, cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-cancer patients. Patients with cancer had higher 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-cancer patients (29.1.3% vs 18.0%) and longer hospital stays (median of 12 days vs 8 days). However, patients with cancer were admitted less often to intensive care units than non-cancer patients (12.6% vs 17.1%) and received less invasive mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients (4.5% vs 7.6%). The hazard ratio of dying from cancer, adjusted for age, sex and country income level was 1.18 (95%CI: 1.15-1.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, revealing a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stays, and an unstructured pattern of care that reflects the complexity of managing severely ill patients during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "ArticleTitle": "An Optimized Method for Single Cell Cloning of Human CAR-T Cells Based on FBS-Coated Plates.",
    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: T cell-based immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, has emerged as an appropriate approach for treating hematologic malignancies and is currently under investigation in clinical trials for solid tumors. Despite significant improvements in CAR-T cell production processes, the isolation and expansion of CAR-engineered T cells continue to pose significant challenges. The aim of this research is to provide a simple and cost-effective method for the isolation and expansion of human CAR-T cells. This novel concept applies coated fetal bovine serum (FBS) culture plates and focuses on enhancing viability and functionality to improve the adherence of suspended T cells. METHODS: This study evaluated a two-dimensional (2D) culture technique for isolating the CAR-T cells that target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) utilizing matrices pre-coated with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and FBS. Jurkat cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the anti-PSMA CAR construct. FBS-coated and commercialized Matrigel-coated matrices were used for single-cell isolation and clonal expansion. Functional tests were conducted to assess the activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells and the IFN-γ release assay subsequent to cloning and expansion. RESULTS: Transfection efficiency markedly improved, with 88.4% of Lenti-X 293T cells demonstrating green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Among the Jurkat cells, 57.1% showed GFP expression post-transduction, of which 34.1% showed surface expression of anti-PSMA CAR. Clonal expansion on the FBS-coated matrix proved effective, yielding 92.1% GFP-positive isolated cells. Functional assays demonstrated that CAR-T cells co-cultured with LNCaP cells exhibited significantly enhanced proliferation, activation (as indicated by CD69 and CD25 expression), and cytokine release assay (IFN-γ) compared with those co-cultured with DU 145 and mock cells. CONCLUSION: This new approach is efficient, economical, and scalable for isolating specific homogenous T cells and promoting their clonal proliferation and expansion. Furthermore, this method improves T cell adherence, proliferation, and functional effectiveness, offering a potential foundation for advancing CAR-T cell therapies aimed at solid tumors. Future research should concentrate on optimizing culture conditions and testing this method in preclinical animal models to ensure its clinical applicability and efficacy.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The Effect of Arsenic Trioxide and Its Combination with Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel on the Induction of Autophagy and Expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 Genes in AGS and MKN-45 Gastric Cancer Cell Lines.",
    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Apoptosis and autophagy play critical roles in the survival and regulation of cancer cells, with key genes serving dual purposes in these processes. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), oxaliplatin (OXA), and docetaxel (DOC) are widely used in the treatment of various cancers. Specifically, ATO inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in certain cancer cells, while OXA and DOC, common agents in cancer chemotherapy, continue to be actively studied for their potential therapeutic effects. METHODS: This study investigated the effects of ATO, DOC, and OXA on AGS and MKN-45 gastric cancer cell lines in vitro. The MTT assay was utilized to determine the effective concentrations of these compounds, both individually and in combination. Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V-FITC staining, and the mRNA levels of genes related to autophagy and apoptosis were analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that the combination of ATO with DOC and OXA significantly reduced the viability of AGS and MKN-45 cells compared to DOC or OXA therapy alone. Notably, the simultaneous administration of all three agents markedly enhanced apoptosis induction. Additionally, the combined use of two drugs showed a more pronounced impact on both cell necrosis and apoptosis compared to the effects of each drug used alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of two therapeutic agents represents a promising strategy for inducing autophagy and gene expression related to apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. This approach exerted a more substantial influence on cell apoptosis and necrosis than single-drug treatments, underscoring its potential as an effective therapeutic option.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer in woman. Vorinostat (VOR) is a chemotherapeutic drug that has been utilized for treatment of breast cancer, but its effectiveness is limited due to low bioavailability and several side effects. The primary aim of this study is to prepare folic acid conjugated pegylated bilosomes containing VOR (FA-PEG- bilosomes) for the selective targeting of breast cancer cells with the FA receptor expression. Accordingly, lithocholic acid was used as a bile acid in bilosomes due to its anti-cancer and anti-proliferation effects. METHODS: VOR loaded bilosomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration method and optimized by applying two-level fractional factorial design. Various properties of the considered bilosomes, including particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PdI), encapsulation efficiency (EE) % and drug loading (DL) %, were then investigated and synthesized FA-PEG-Cholesterol was incorporated in the optimized bilosomes. The anti-cancer efficacy of VOR loaded FA-PEG- bilosomes was also evaluated in vitro using the MCF-7 and 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, drug free FA-PEG-bilosomes and bilosomes were evaluated for biocompatibility in the L929 cell line. RESULTS: The optimized VOR loaded bilosomes exhibited spherical particles with the size of 305.33±18.50 nm, PdI of 0.37±0.03, zeta potential of -17.66±0.15 mV, EE of 92.91±0.22 % and DL% of 23.64±0.04%. Incorporation of FA-PEG-cholesterol in nanobilosomes increased the particle size and absolute value of zeta potential. In vitro cytotoxicity study also revealed that VOR loaded FA- PEG-bilosomes demonstrated a greater cytotoxic effect, as compared to the free VOR and VOR- bilosomes in both MCF-7 and 4T1 cancer cells. CONCLUSION: This showed that FA- PEG-bilosomes could be a promising formulation for the treatment of FA (+) tumors.",

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has emerged as a valuable technique for the local control of advanced HCC, especially in cases unsuitable for surgical resection. Para-toluenesulfonamide (PTS) has demonstrated antitumor properties in various cancers, yet its efficacy against HCC remains underexplored. The present study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of PTS in HCC and examine potential synergistic effects with RFA. METHODS: PTS was injected directly into subcutaneous tumor tissues and its effects on cell survival, gene expression, and metabolic activity in HCC cells were evaluated. The effect of PTS and RFA in combination on HCC growth was examined using a nude mouse model of subcutaneous HCC. Data were visualized using heat maps. RESULTS: PTS inhibited the survival of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner, modulating the expression of key genes related to cell survival, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and proliferation. The combination of PTS and RFA markedly enhanced the inhibition of HCC tumor growth and induced alterations in cellular metabolism. CONCLUSION: Combining PTS and RFA may be a promising approach to improve the efficacy of HCC treatment.",

However, the tool used to determine which patients likely benefit most from this treatment strategy has not been reported. We sought to develop a prognostic scoring system based on tumor burden score (TBS) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to predict the long-term prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies. METHODS: Data on patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies from multiple centers were collected. The prognostic accuracy of TBS, AFP, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and CTA (Combined TBS and AFP) for 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 278 patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies were enrolled, including 48 BCLC-B and 230 BCLC-C HCC patients. CTA (AUC = 0.721 and 0.683) outperformed TBS (AUC = 0.680 and 0.621), AFP (AUC = 0.606 and 0.594), and BCLC staging (AUC = 0.551 and 0.555) in predicting PFS and OS. The 2-year PFS and OS for low CTA (low TBS/low AFP) were 65.7% and 94.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 21.6% and 44.9% (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002), respectively, for intermediate CTA (low TBS/high AFP or high TBS/low AFP) and 8.7% and 12.1% (both p < 0.001), respectively, for high CTA (high TBS/high AFP). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that CTA grading was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (referent: low CTA; intermediate CTA, HR 2.87 and 7.17; high CTA, HR 5.52 and 10.31, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: CTA grading is an accurate tool for stratifying the prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies and may help determine which patients may benefit more from this treatment strategy.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Gallbladder polyps (GPs) are protrusions of the gallbladder wall into the lumen, and are commonly detected during ultrasound examinations. Traditional management of multiple GPs (MGPs) has been conservative, including lifestyle interventions, regular monitoring, and surgical intervention in certain cases, but this approach poses risks of polyps enlargement and increase of number, as well as patients' psychological burdens. Danning Tablets, a traditional Chinese medicine, have emerged as a potential non-surgical treatment for GPs, showing promise in reducing polyp size and alleviating symptoms, backed by their anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties demonstrated in preclinical studies. This suggests the need for further research into Danning Tablets as an alternative treatment for MGPs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label trial. The study will be conducted across multiple centres specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology. Participants will be recruited from these centres, ensuring a diverse patient demographic. Adult patients diagnosed with MGPs, based on ultrasound findings, will be included. Exclusion criteria include patients with a history of gallbladder cancer, previous gallbladder surgery, or serious comorbid conditions. The control group will receive standard care, including dietary and lifestyle advice, while the intervention group will receive Danning Tablets and standard care. The dosage and administration of Danning Tablets will follow established clinical guidelines. The primary outcome will be the change in size of the largest gallbladder polyps on week 24 ± 1, measured by ultrasound. The secondary outcomes will include symptom improvement and recording of any adverse events. The study will span over a period of 6 months, with periodic assessments at baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.",

    "AbstractText": "Currently, the prognosis for patients with advanced bladder cancer remains poor, with only a minority being sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. There is a need to develop additional treatment strategies. Microwave therapy, as a promising approach for some inoperable tumors, still faces challenges such as limited efficacy and high recurrence rates. Additionally, the cell damage and necrosis induced by conventional microwave treatment only act as weak immunostimulatory factors for antitumor immunity, failing to activate effective antitumor immune responses. Recent discoveries have shown that inducing pyroptosis can provide a good opportunity for enhancing systemic immune responses and alleviating immune suppression in cancer therapy. Here, we have developed Mn-ZrMOF@DAC, a microwave-sensitized nanoparticle loaded with the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine. The Mn-ZrMOF@DAC can enhance the effect of microwave thermal therapy and generate reactive oxygen species under microwave irradiation, causing thermal and oxidative damage to cancer cells. Furthermore, there was an important up-regulation of the key pyroptosis protein GSDME, with a marked increase in pyroptotic cell numbers. In vivo experiments demonstrated that mice injected with Mn-ZrMOF@DAC nanoparticles followed by microwave radiation treatment exhibited potent antitumor effects and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. This therapy not only enhanced the efficacy of microwave treatment, exhibiting significant antitumor effects, but also activated antitumor immunity by inducing pyroptosis, thus enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for bladder cancer. It holds promise for providing new avenues in the treatment of bladder cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "Count data with complex features arise in many disciplines, including ecology, agriculture, criminology, medicine, and public health. Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are currently two classes of models that allow for these features-the mode-parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COMP) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose spatial mean-parameterized COMP models that retain the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump MCMC to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The COMP distribution poses two additional computational challenges-an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation. We illustrate the application of our methodology to simulated and real datasets, including Texas HPV-cancer data and US vaccine refusal data.

The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and prodrug can enhance the therapeutic efficacy while simultaneously enabling real-time monitoring of drug distribution and release. However, the tumor hypoxia microenvironment and the frequent high-dose administration of prodrugs significantly impede therapeutic efficacy and escalate treatment-related risks. Herein, a tumor microenvironment-specific release prodrug is constructed, termed NBS-2S-5FU. Under the influence of glutathione (GSH), NBS-2S-5FU undergoes activation, leading to the release of photosensitizer NBS and chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU derivatives. Under irradiation, NBS produces sufficient superoxide radical (   O 2 - •     ) while 5-FU derivatives inhibit DNA biosynthesis, thereby effectively suppressing tumor growth at low doses. Subsequent in vivo studies utilizing NBS-2S-5FU liposomes exhibit outstanding anti-cancer effectiveness.

We retrospectively reviewed the first 100 consecutive HSCT from April 2019 to October 2021 in the only pediatric HSCT center in Hong Kong. We found that the vast majority of the allogeneic transplant recipients (69/74, 93.2%) had infections after HSCT, amongst which bacterial, viral, and fungal infection rates were 35.1%, 90.5%, and 9.5%, respectively. In contrast, only 30.8% (8/26) of autologous transplant recipients had infections (rate of bacterial, viral, and fungal infection were 19.2%, 15.4%, and 3.8%, respectively). Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and BK virus (BKV) typically occurred early after HSCT, adenovirus (ADV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) thereafter, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) throughout the entire 2.5-year observation period. Ex vivo T-cell depletion was a general risk factor for viral infection with HHV-6 (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.03), BKV (HR = 3.36), CMV (HR = 4.45), and EBV (HR = 7.15); all p < 0.02.

    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: The prostate gland diseases are associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC) and exposure to toxic trace elements may promote the prostatic disorders in men. The present study is intended to analyze the concentrations of twenty elements (Al, Sb, Ca, Se, Cd, Fe, Hg, As, Zn, Mn, Na, Li, Cu, Co, Mg, Sr, Ni, K, Cr and Pb) in the serum of BPH (n = 188) and PC (n = 217) patients and in comparison with controls (n = 233). Nitric acid-perchloric acid mixture was used for serum digestion followed by determination of the metals/metalloid by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. This study elucidates the imbalances of the elements with BPH/PC patients and healthy subjects. For multiple comparisons, Bonferroni test was applied and principal component analysis was performed for measuring the multiple metals/metalloid exposure. Mean concentrations of Al, Cr, Pb, Cd, Na, Ni and K were found higher significantly (p < 0.05) in the serum of BPH patients compared with healthy controls, while average levels of Sb, Al, Cd, As, Mn, Sr, K and Pb were significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in PC patients than controls. The correlation patterns revealed significantly different mutual associations among the metals/metalloid in patients as compared to controls. Multivariate statistical methods showed substantially divergent grouping of the metals/metalloid for both groups of patients and healthy controls.

    "AbstractText": "Cell culture techniques are the vital basis for the majority of experimental cancer research. Targeting cancer cells metabolism is one of the key strategies for controlling the growth of cancer cells. D-Mannoheptulose (MH) (as Phytotherapy) a specific inhibitor, belonging to hexokinase category, to inhibit glycolysis pathway and Doxorubicin (DXR) (as Chemotherapy) has cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and anti-cancer effects by inducing apoptosis. Evaluating the effect of D-Mannoheptulose and Doxorubicin on the normal and breast cancer cell line by determining their anti-tumor activities. Cell culture of normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and MCF-7 cell line were achieved by using Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) and RPMI-1640 Medium. D-Mannoheptulose, and Doxorubicin stock and diluted solutions were prepared by using phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) respectively. HMECs and MCF7 cell line were treated with MH, and DXR, cytotoxicity ratio was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). The findings of study indicated a substantial increase in the cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effects of MH and DXR depending on the concentration gradient against breast cancer cell lines and IC50 values, while on the other hand, there was no significant cytotoxic effect on normal cells. Results of the study revealed that MH, DXR, can result in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cell lines. This behaviour was mainly due to the increase in cytotoxicity through inhibiting the glycolysis pathway thereby resulting in apoptosis. This further lead to the decrease in HK activity and hence pyruvate as well as ATP amount. Overall, DXR and MH treatment display effective cytotoxic effects against the studied breast cancer cell lines.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Thymol Enhances 5-Fluorouracil Cytotoxicity by Reducing Migration and Increasing Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest in Esophageal Cancer Cells: An In-vitro Study.",
    "AbstractText": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common cancer globally and has a low survival rate because it is often diagnosed at a late-stage, and is frequently chemotherapy resistant. Thymol is found in the herb thyme and has been reported to have potential anticancer properties. We aimed to explore the effects of thymol on the efficacy of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment in an in vitro model of EC. We evaluated the synergistic effects of thymol with 5-FU using cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, scratch wound healing assay, gelatin zymography, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation aproaches. The results indicated that thymol significantly decreased the viability of KYSE-30 cells in a time and dose-dependently. However, thymol had a minimal cytotoxic effect against normal fibroblasts. In addition, thymol significantly increased the chemosensitivity of EC KYSE-30 cells to 5-FU by promoting early and late apoptosis, inducing Sub-G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest, and increasing ROS generation. Combination therapy of thymol with 5-FU also resulted in an increased expression of p53 and Bax, decreased expression of Bcl2, reduced activity of MMP-2, and reduced cell migration compared to single therapies. These findings suggest that thymol has the potential to promote the anticancer potency of 5-FU chemotherapy and inhibit metastasis. However, further studies using animal models are necessary to validate these results.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Effects of Tin(IV) Complexes Containing a Schiff Base Derived from Cephalexin on a Breast Cancer Cell Line.",
    "AbstractText": "Metal complexes containing heterocycles have wide pharmaceutical and medicinal applications. The biological activities of the complexes are influenced by a range of factors, including the identity of the ligands coordinated to the tin ion and the heteroatoms contained in them. Additionally, stabilizing the bonds between the tin atom and the ligand impacts the effectiveness of organotin complexes as biologically active molecules. This study involves the synthesis of new metal complexes and their evaluation for cytotoxic and apoptotic effects against human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The reaction of cephalexin and 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde in boiling methanol gave the corresponding Schiff base in a good yield. Subsequently, the reactions of disubstituted (methyl, butyl, and phenyl) tin chlorides and the Schiff base in boiling methanol produced the corresponding organotin(IV) complexes in high yields. The effect of the synthesized organotin complexes on MCF-7 was assessed. Based on the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) results, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay proved that all the organotin complexes effectively suppressed cancer growth. The dibutyl derivative of the three complexes tested had higher anticancer activity against MCF-7 cells than the dimethyl and diphenyl compounds. The IC50 values for the synthesized tin complexes ranged between 95 and 71 μg/mL. Based on the concentration of the complex, a high content screening technique (HCS) assay showed a decrease in MCF-7 cell line cell viability. This decrease was proportional to the viable cell count, membrane permeability, total nuclear intensity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome C levels.",

A case-control study was conducted to assess the association between FHC and CRC risk in Kashmir, India, with a detailed analysis of epidemiological data and information on multiple gene polymorphisms. We collected detailed information on FHC and a number of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, and also obtained blood samples for genetic analysis from 246 histopathologically confirmed CRC cases and 246 individually matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The study participants diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibited a robust correlation with a positive family history of CRC. In terms of gender-based analysis, it was observed that males with CRC and a family history of CRC had an odds ratio of 16.45 (95% CI; 2.14-126.26), whereas females exhibited an odds ratio of 4.11 (95% CI; 0.84-20.03). Furthermore, individuals with affected parents showed an almost fivefold increase (OR = 4.70, 95% CI: 0.98-1.06), underscoring the substantial association. Our study unveiled significant correlations between Xenobiotic gene variants and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Among individuals without a family history (FH-), those with the CYP2A6a gene variant (*1A/*6 and *6/*6 genotypes) exhibited a substantial 2.03-fold increase in CRC risk (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.17-3.51, p-value = 0.011). Turning to the CYP2A6b gene variant, FH- individuals carrying *1/*4 and *4/*4 genotypes demonstrated a modestly increased CRC risk (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.98-2.39, p-value = 0.069), suggesting a potential association. On the similar pattern, among FH + individuals, the GSTT1- genotype displayed a notably increased CRC risk (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 0.61-42.38, p-value = 0.014). FH- individuals with the GSTM1- genotype showcased a substantially increased CRC risk (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 2.52-6.23, p-value = 0.001), whereas the association lacked statistical significance in FH + individuals (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 0.56-8.76, p-value = 0.258).

    "AbstractText": "The crucial role of ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) enzyme in cancer occurrence and progression has been well-established, but its specific function and significance in medulloblastoma (MB) remains largely unknown. First, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of public genomic databases and observed highly expressed RRM2 in MB and an association of high RRM2 expression with adverse outcomes. In addition, by collecting clinical MB specimens for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC), RRM2 was confirmed to be highly expressed in tumor tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis linked adverse prognosis to high RRM2 expression. Moreover, knocking down RRM2 significantly inhibited MB cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. This report is the first to demonstrate the oncogenic role of RRM2 in MB, associated with adverse patient outcomes. Knocking down RRM2 contributes to weakened proliferating, migrating, and invading potentials of MB cells. RRM2 is expected to be a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for MB.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The necessity of prostate biopsy in patients with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score below 3 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 4-10 ng/ml remains controversial. We tested the diagnostic performance of the free PSA ratio (%fPSA) in detecting clinically significant cancer (CSC) in patients with PI-RADS <3 and PSA ≤10 ng/ml. METHODS: We analyzed 1435 prostate biopsies performed by a single operator between April 2018 and January 2023 at a single institution. PSA and free PSA results on the day of biopsy or within 1 month were used, and all biopsies were performed after prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CSC was defined as Gleason grade group ≥2. RESULTS: Among 208 men with PI-RADS <3 and PSA ≤10 ng/ml, CSC was detected in 37 (17.8%) patients. The median age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 61-71), with a median PSA level of 5.06 ng/ml (IQR 3.98-7.08) and a median %fPSA of 18.2% (IQR 13.7-22.0). The area under the curve was 0.757 (95% confidence interval, 0.674-0.841), with a %fPSA cutoff of 17.6%, sensitivity of 86.5%, specificity of 63.7%, positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 2.38, and negative LR of 0.21. CSC was diagnosed in 5 out of 114 patients (4%) with %fPSA >17.6%, compared to 32 out of 94 patients (34%) with %fPSA <17.6%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PI-RADS <3 and PSA ≤10 ng/ml, %fPSA values < 17.6% may facilitate early prostate cancer diagnosis in those who might not undergo biopsy based on MRI results alone. Additionally, unnecessary biopsies could be avoided in patients with elevated PSA levels when %fPSA exceeds 17.6%.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients who had received first-line docetaxel for mCRPC. The KELIM score was calculated using PSA measurements obtained within the first 100 days of chemotherapy. The patients were divided into two groups based on the KELIM levels: KELIM PSA <1 and KELIM PSA ≥1. The relationship between overall survival (OS) and the KELIM groups was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were included in this study. The median age was 68.1 years (interquartile range (IQR) 62.2-71.1). There were 76 and 88 patients in the KELIM PSA <1 and KELIM PSA ≥1 groups, respectively. The median OS in the KELIM PSA ≥1 group (46.2 months, 95% confidence interval (CI): 38.8-53.6) was found to be longer than in the KELIM PSA <1 group (32.0 months, 95% CI: 23.1-40.9) (P = 0.032). In multivariate analysis, the risk of death was independently higher in the KELIM PSA <1 group than in the KELIM PSA ≥1 group (Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.58, 95% CI: 1.02-2.43, P = 0.037).

The accepted prophylactic antibiotic is usually a single agent oral fluoroquinolone; however, this approach is beset by growing antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to assess whether the addition of intravenous gentamicin (2 mg/kg or at least 160 mg), immediately prior to biopsy, in conjunction with routine ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, reduced infection and sepsis rates post TRUS biopsy. METHOD: Six hundred fifty-eight patients underwent TRUS biopsy at our center from 2017 to 2022, of whom 648 had data sufficient for analysis. We performed a retrospective analysis focusing on patient demographics (age, BMI, diabetes status), biopsy parameters, and outcomes of sepsis and urinary tract infection . Patients were recorded as developing sepsis if they required hospital admission for intravenous antibiotics. Fisher's exact test was employed for categorical variables, while the Student's t test was utilized for continuous variables for statistical significance. RESULTS: The rate of sepsis was 3.9% in the ciprofloxacin-only group, versus 0% in the ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin group (P value = 0.03). Overall aggregated post-TRUS infection rates was also 0% in the ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin group (P value = 0.005). We found no associated between infection and secondary risk factors. CONCLUSION: The administration of 2 mg/kg intravenous gentamicin with oral ciprofloxacin prophylaxis reduces infection and sepsis rates post TRUS biopsy.",

However, while many advanced spatial analysis methods have been recently published, they are enmeshed with specific imaging technology. An opportunity exists to develop a technology-agnostic methodology that captures complex spatial patterns in the TME as phenotypes to use in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel variation of spatial g-function and a comprehensive imaging-technology-agnostic framework that identifies rich spatial phenotypes that can be used in survival analysis and classification tasks. Applying our methodology to breast cancer, we uncover spatial phenotypes with significance to survival across racial groups and molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We find other phenotypes that are significant to the survival of specific patient categories (such as African American). We also demonstrate that our phenotypes reflect specific biological contexts. These results highlight the relevance of our proposed spatial analysis and phenotype discovery pipeline and demonstrate the benefits of the systematic exploration of spatial phenotypes for more personalized diagnosis and treatments.",

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 42 Australian women with gynaecological cancer, aged between 27 to 53 years, who were on average five years post-diagnosis (range 1-10 years). Thematic discourse analysis, from a material-discursive-intrapsychic approach, was used to explore how women narrated their fertility-related concerns in the broader social and healthcare contexts. RESULTS: While narrating their experiences of having gynaecological cancer, the women in our study negotiated their accounts within two competing discourses - the pronatalist discourse and the survivorship discourse. Women's talk appeared conflicted by the social expectation to become a 'good' mother and focus on ensuring their fertility, while also managing the 'survivorship' imperative to focus exclusively on 'fighting' and beating cancer. Many women struggled to negotiate their fertility concerns and treatment decisions because of these two competing discourses. CONCLUSION: Dominant discourses around survival and prioritising motherhood create enormous conflict for women with gynaecological cancer coping with fertility concerns. Helping women to develop meaningful narratives is needed, particularly for women with ovarian cancer.",

The primary objective of this investigation is to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying the role of the aging process and the related factor Epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) in PC progression. We established a prognostic model pertinent to the aging process that could be applied in postoperative PC patients. In vitro assays were employed to elucidate the impact of EMP1 on PC cell function. We employed lentiviral vectors for both knockdown and overexpression of EMP1 in Panc02 cells, followed by the establishment of subcutaneous, pulmonary metastasis, and orthotopic pancreatic liver metastasis models in mice. Using tissue microarrays, we evaluated the expression of EMP1 and its downstream entities, and then conducted clinical correlation analysis. A predictive Age-Related Score (ARS) system based on age-associated prognostic genes was developed, offering precise prognostic predictions for postoperative PC patients, which could be applied well at the single-cell level, showing diverse aging, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, cell proliferation, and PI3K/AKT signaling activity in high and low ARS risk cells. EMP1 was identified as a pivotal molecule in the ARS system and is associated with poor prognosis. Besides, EMP1 could enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells both in vitro and in vivo by augmenting the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. In essence, this research formulated an aging-centric prognostic model for postoperative PC and pinpointed EMP1 as an oncogenic factor facilitating tumor cell EMT during the aging trajectory in resectable PC patients.",

The ZnONPs were synthesized using ZnSO4 and NaOH, resulting in an average size of 125 nm, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed a hexagonal crystalline structure. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed an absorption peak at 360 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 3.37 eV, making these nanoparticles suitable for controlled drug delivery systems. The antioxidant activity of T. chinensis extract was evaluated using the DPPH assay, demonstrating an 80% inhibition of free radicals at 500 µg/mL, surpassing the antioxidant potential of the ZnONPs. The antimicrobial efficacy of the ZnONPs was evidenced by a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <50 µg/mL against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, the ZnONPs exhibited antiproliferative activity with an IC50 of 20.80 µg/mL in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, highlighting their potential for biomedical applications.

This retrospective study aimed to identify the risk factors for SSI in right-sided colon cancer surgery using intracorporeal anastomosis (IA). We focused on perioperative factors, including the bowel preparation method, to clarify the impact of preoperative mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and oral antibiotics (OA) on SSI incidence. METHODS: Patients (n = 150) with right-sided colon cancer who underwent elective laparoscopic or robot-assisted colectomy (2019 and 2023) were included. Potential risk factors for SSI were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The overall incidence of SSI was 11 (7.3%) cases, with eight (5.4%) cases classified as incision site SSI and three (1.9%) as organ/space SSI. Univariate analysis showed that OA (p < 0.001) and MBP (p = 0.002) significantly reduced the SSI rate. Multivariate analysis identified OA as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio, 0.142; 95% confidence interval, 0.025-0.827; p = 0.025). Patients with SSI had longer postoperative hospital stays compared to those without SSI (median 9 vs. 8 days, p = 0.012). On postoperative day 1, the group receiving OA had significantly lower white blood cell count (9390 vs. 10 900/μL, p = 0.005) and C-reactive protein levels (3.81 vs. 7.83 mg/dL, p < 0.001) compared to those in the group not receiving OA.

    "AbstractText": "In modern medicine, spleen, the largest secondary lymphoid organ, is responsible for red blood cell turnover and immune inductions. The immune system and spleen actively orchestrate local or systemic inflammatory responses under different disease conditions. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), spleen contributes to the body integrity and the essence of \"Qi\"by collaborating in concert with the other organs (\"Zang\" in TCM). In both realms, spleen is not a solitary organ since it constantly interacts or \"crosstalks\" with the rest of the body to maintain homeostasis by secreting or responding to signaling molecules from relevant pathways. Since the spleen is involved in organ crosstalk axes, the health status of many other organs can be potentially alluded when we clinically assess the spleen. However, due to structural delicacy and intrinsic disadvantages of conventional pathology such as biopsy, evaluating the spleen status is challenging. To this end, molecular imaging, a non-invasive and efficient modality, emerged as an elegant solution to provide highly precise depiction of spleen phenotypes. It provides a mesoscopic overview of the spleen's physical status and biological processes occurring at the cellular or molecular level in vivo. With the application of molecular imaging modalities, spleen is now appreciated as a key organ involved in the development or progress of various diseases, such as cancer. We expect molecular imaging of the spleen to be a robust starting point for us to understand the molecular level changes underlying physiological observations including spleen crosstalk in TCM and modern medicine, providing mechanistic evidence for phenotypic patterns.",

For the year 2024, it is estimated that 310,720 new instances of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed, and breast cancer will be responsible for over 42,000 deaths among women. Today, despite the availability of numerous treatments for breast cancer and its symptoms, most cancer-related deaths result from metastasis for which there is no treatment. This emphasizes the importance of early detection and treatment of breast cancer before it spreads. For initial detection and staging of breast cancer, clinicians routinely employ mammography and ultrasonography, which, while effective for broad screening, have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Advanced biomarkers could significantly enhance the precision of early detection, enable more accurate monitoring of disease evolution, and facilitate the development of personalized treatment plans tailored to the specific molecular profile of each tumor. This would not only improve therapeutic outcomes, but also help in avoiding overtreatment and the associated side effects, thereby improving the quality of life for patients. Thus, the pursuit of novel biomarkers, potentially encompassing metabolomic and lipidomic signatures, is essential for advancing breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

In addition, HiLoTRUST has attained a finer mechanical sectioning thickness (10-15 µm) compared to TRUST (50 µm). For high-content imaging as in TRUST, we employed two additional UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) specifically for uniform illumination. The full-color imaging ability and improved axial resolution of HiLoTRUST have been validated by two-dimensional (2D)/3D imaging of various mouse organs and human lung cancer specimens.

We introduce a novel multimodal imaging strategy to unravel the complex spatial heterogeneity of CRC by integrating the imaging features from two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) and histology with proteomics signatures from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI). Our study is the first to correlate the structural coherence of collagen fibres and the nuclei distribution profile of tumour tissue with the peptide signatures, offering insights into the proteomic landscape of CRC within regions of high nuclei distribution (HND), as well as chaotic and organised regions of collagen. We use this approach to distinguish the patient tissues originating from left-sided colorectal cancer (LSCC) and from right-sided colorectal cancer (RSCC). This discriminative signature highlights the role of high nuclei distribution and collagen architecture in tumour progression. Complementary m/z values of several proteins associated to components of ECM, such as plectin, vinculin, vimentin, and myosin, have shown differentially intensity distributions between LSCC and RSCC. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining structural information with peptide features to identify molecular signatures in different tumour regions and retrieve new insights into CRC pathophysiology.",

    "AbstractText": "Advances in cancer biology have highlighted metabolic reprogramming as an essential aspect of tumorigenesis and progression. However, recent efforts to study tumor metabolism in vivo have identified some disconnects between in vitro and in vivo biology. This is due, at least in part, to the simplified nature of cell culture models and highlights a growing need to utilize more physiologically relevant approaches to more accurately assess tumor metabolism. In this review, we outline the evolution of our understanding of cancer metabolism and discuss some discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo conditions. We describe how the development of physiological media, in combination with advanced culturing methods, can bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo metabolism.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Applications of artificial intelligence in the analysis of histopathology images of gliomas: a review.",
    "AbstractText": "In recent years, the diagnosis of gliomas has become increasingly complex. Analysis of glioma histopathology images using artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to support diagnosis and outcome prediction. To give an overview of the current state of research, this review examines 83 publicly available research studies that have proposed AI-based methods for whole-slide histopathology images of human gliomas, covering the diagnostic tasks of subtyping (23/83), grading (27/83), molecular marker prediction (20/83), and survival prediction (29/83). All studies were reviewed with regard to methodological aspects as well as clinical applicability. It was found that the focus of current research is the assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of adult-type diffuse gliomas. The majority of studies (52/83) are based on the publicly available glioblastoma and low-grade glioma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and only a few studies employed other datasets in isolation (16/83) or in addition to the TCGA datasets (15/83). Current approaches mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (63/83) for analyzing tissue at 20x magnification (35/83). A new field of research is the integration of clinical data, omics data, or magnetic resonance imaging (29/83). So far, AI-based methods have achieved promising results, but are not yet used in real clinical settings. Future work should focus on the independent validation of methods on larger, multi-site datasets with high-quality and up-to-date clinical and molecular pathology annotations to demonstrate routine applicability.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Dysregulated Long Non-Coding RNAs in Colorectal Cancer: Identification and Validation Using RNA-seq and Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide, posing a significant public health challenge. Recent advances in molecular research and technologies have highlighted the potential of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as key players in CRC development and progression. High-throughput technologies, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), enable comprehensive analysis of cancer omics data, providing valuable insights into CRC biology. This study aimed to identify and validate lncRNAs with potential roles in CRC pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, we conducted RNA-seq analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs between 481 CRC and 41 healthy control samples. Using the Boruta feature selection algorithm, we identified statistically significant lncRNAs. Based on a comprehensive literature review, four lncRNAs (LINC01730, LINC02487, LINC01836, and LINC01594) were selected for experimental validation. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on 10 primary CRC and 9 normal colorectal tissue samples to quantify the expression of these lncRNAs. Additionally, bioinformatic analyses were conducted to explore molecular pathways associated with these lncRNAs in CRC. RESULTS: RNA-seq analysis identified 388 differentially expressed lncRNAs in CRC tissues compared to healthy controls. Among these, four lncRNAs (LINC01730, LINC02487, LINC01836, and LINC01594) were validated through real-time RT-PCR, confirming their significant upregulation in CRC tissues. Bioinformatic analysis revealed their potential involvement in molecular pathways critical to tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: This study identified and validated four significantly upregulated lncRNAs (LINC01730, LINC02487, LINC01836, and LINC01594) in CRC tissues, providing evidence of their potential roles in CRC pathogenesis. These lncRNAs could serve as promising candidates for future biomarker development and therapeutic research in colorectal cancer.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Histone lactylation as a driver of metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion.",
    "AbstractText": "Lactate is the end product of glycolysis, and extensive research has shown that lactate participates in various pathophysiological processes. Along with associated hydrogen ions, lactate typically functions as an immunosuppressive negative factor and plays a crucial role in tumor metabolic reprogramming. The recently discovered lactylation is a novel epigenetic modification that, similar to other epigenetic modifications, modifies histones to alter chromatin spatial configuration, thereby affecting DNA accessibility and regulating gene expression. More importantly, the degree of lactylation is closely related to local lactate concentrations, establishing a link between epigenetics and metabolic reprogramming. During cellular metabolism, lactate accumulation promotes histone lysine lactylation in cancer cells and immune cells such as macrophages and T cells, playing an essential role in tumor immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. This paper details the role of lactylation modifications in cancer immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy, providing novel therapeutic directions and targets for cancer treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "Recently, single-walled carbon nanotube-based optical biosensors have been shown to detect hydrolase activity directly on target substrates such as proteins and peptides. This study presents a metastable protein conjugation approach to immobilize more hydrophobic proteins and enhance the sensitivity of protease detection. The method combines covalent conjugation of substrate proteins via carbodiimide chemistry (EDC/NHS) with non-covalent polymer wrapping of SWCNT, in this case, carboxymethyl cellulose. The formation of protein-SWCNT complexes as a result of multi-site conjugation between the proteins and carboxyl groups, enabled iterative pelleting, washing, and resuspension steps to be applied to the probes which allowed for removal of unbound proteins and residual materials, enhancing the sensor's sensitivity by approximately threefold, reaching an LOD of 6.4 ng/ml in a 5 minute reaction. This immobilization approach is applied to the ECM proteins such as gelatin and collagen and used to detect ECM degrading enzymes' activity. ECM degrading enzymes caused a fluorescent intensity decrease of the SWCNT probes, enabling quantification of enzyme concentration between the range 160 ng/ml to 100 µg/ml within 5 minutes of reaction. This hybrid approach provides a rapid and sensitive platform for detecting extracellular degrading enzymes with potential applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, wound healing, high-throughput screening for enzyme inhibitors and drug discovery.",

    "AbstractText": "The demographic characteristics of breast cancer patients from disparate geographical regions vary considerably. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to present the clinicopathological features of breast cancer patients at our center and to conduct a comparative analysis with the findings of other studies. This retrospective descriptive study, which included 816 patients registered in the two years between October 2021 and September 2023, was conducted in the Department of Medical Oncology at a government tertiary cancer care center in southern India. At the initial presentation, the median age was 49 years, with the majority of patients being postmenopausal. The most common presenting complaint was a breast lump, which was reported in 636 cases (77.9%). Additionally, 115 cases (14.09%) involved axillary edema. A family history of breast cancer was evident in 19.9% (162/816) of the patients. Of the patients, 594 (72.8%) exhibited hormone receptor positivity. Of the total number of cases, 202 (nearly 25%) were positive for HER2/neu by FISH or IHC. A total of 178 patients (21.9%) were diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The majority of patients (46.8%) presented at a late stage, classified as Stage III. In cases of stage IV disease, there was a greater prevalence of skeletal metastases (40.3%) compared to visceral metastases. The present study offers insight into the current state of breast cancer patients in Southern India. The majority of patients were postmenopausal. Additionally, there has been an observed increase in the number of patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors, accompanied by a higher prevalence of metastatic disease involving skeletal metastasis compared to other sites. It is imperative to enhance awareness about breast cancer, assuage apprehensions, and disseminate information about the significance of screening, prompt diagnosis, and treatment. Such studies provide a foundation for understanding the extent of the problem and facilitate the identification of potential solutions.",

    "AbstractText": "The risk of cancer development posed by papillomavirus (PV) infections is significant, affecting both humans and domestic animals. This underscores the importance of understanding and addressing this viral threat. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), in enhancing the immune response against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor-related neoantigens, thereby facilitating their neutralization by the immune system. Furthermore, vaccines designed to enhance the immune response against PV-infected cells have yielded promising results, strengthening CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactions and potentially impeding cancer progression. The oncoproteins E6 and E7, which are notably implicated in the development of malignancies, exert deleterious effects by disrupting tumor suppressor proteins and facilitating immune evasion and tumor proliferation, particularly in high-risk PV genotypes such as HPV-16 and HPV-18. Notwithstanding obstacles such as vaccine hesitancy and concerns regarding vaccine toxicity, PV vaccines have transformed disease prevention strategies, offering a promising avenue in the fight against PV-associated cancers. Advancements in precision medicine and immunotherapy offer promise in the management of advanced PV-related cancers. By identifying and exploiting specific molecular vulnerabilities, while simultaneously bolstering immune responses, these approaches may prove invaluable in combating this disease. This transformative approach has the potential to treat established cancers and prevent their recurrence and progression. Consequently, immunotherapies, therapeutic vaccines, and precision medicine have become the subject of considerable scientific interest due to their capacity to enhance the quality of life and outcomes for individuals afflicted with PV-related cancers. By harnessing the immune system's power and leveraging cutting-edge therapeutic modalities, researchers and clinicians are poised to reshape the landscape of cancer treatment, offering renewed hope and optimism for those affected by PV-associated malignancies. It is therefore imperative that innovative strategies be integrated into clinical practice in order to effectively combat the formidable challenge posed by PV-induced cancers. In conclusion, this review presents a promising direction for combating PV infections and associated malignancies, with the potential to transform the landscape of cancer treatment. By employing immunotherapies, therapeutic vaccines, and precision medicine, researchers and clinicians are positioned to make substantial advancements in the prevention and treatment of PV-related cancers, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Greenly Synthesized Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles (MnO NPs) In Tumor Therapy: A Narrative Review.",
    "AbstractText": "One of the most destructive diseases of the twenty-first century is cancer, which has given rise to significant concerns among medical professionals and academics alike. In order to achieve victory in the fight against cancer, a multitude of therapeutic modalities are currently being investigated. Nanotechnology has emerged as a significant field of scientific inquiry, with potential applications across a range of disciplines. It draws upon insights from a range of disciplines, including chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, biology, and health sciences. In recent years, there has been a notable surge in the application of nanotechnology in the field of medicine, with the aim of preventing and treating diseases within the human body. Over the past two decades, manganese oxide nanomaterials (MnONs) and their derivatives have garnered increasing interest for applications in bioimaging, biosensing, drug/gene delivery, and tumor therapy. This is due to the tunable structures/morphologies, unique physical/chemical properties, and excellent biosecurity of these materials. The green synthesis of MnNPs using raw materials, vegetables and fruits, plant extracts, microorganisms, and fungi offers several advantages, including non-toxicity, environmental friendliness, cleanliness, and cost-effectiveness. Given the variety of mechanisms through which they act, green-produced MnNPs represent a promising source of new anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds. MnNPs have been demonstrated to exert anti-proliferative activity against a range of cancer cells, including those of the colon, liver, cervix, breast, melanoma, and prostate, by activating apoptotic signal transduction pathways or inhibiting angiogenic signaling. In the context of cancer treatment, research is being conducted into the potential of metal nanotherapy, including the use of MnO NPs. The enhanced tissue penetration and retention properties of MnO facilitate its function as a drug carrier. MnONPs have been proposed to exhibit enzyme-like activities, including peroxidase, catalase, oxidase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. The biocompatibility obtained through green synthesis indicates the potential for its use not only in specific cancer conditions but also in other types of cancer, without the risk of toxicity associated with these compounds. It is conceivable that these therapeutic strategies may prove beneficial not only in the aforementioned cases of cancer but also in other instances of proliferative disorders. The low risk of toxicity associated with these compounds, as evidenced by the biocompatibility obtained through green synthesis, suggests their potential use in a range of biomedical applications.",

    "AbstractText": "The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a significant public health concern among long-term hospitalized patients, particularly those with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients. This is primarily due to MRSA's ability to resist antimicrobial agents and drugs. The objective of this study is to ascertain the antibiotic resistance pattern of MRSA in cancer patients admitted to hospitals in the southwest region of Iran. The samples obtained from the patients were cultivated on blood agar and EMB medium. Subsequently, the positive samples containing S. aureus were identified through the application of a phenotypic method. Subsequently, the cefoxitin antibiogram was employed for the isolation of MRSA. Furthermore, the isolates were subjected to testing for simultaneous drug resistance against 12 different antibiotics. To detect the presence of the mec gene, a molecular method was employed, namely the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, and electrophoresis of the obtained products was conducted. Of the 41 S. aureus samples identified, 33 were found to be methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Of the 33 MRSA isolates, the presence of the mec gene was confirmed, and they exhibited simultaneous drug resistance. Individuals with cancer, who frequently have indwelling catheters and receive a variety of drugs and blood products, are at an elevated risk of contamination with this bacterium due to its presence on their skin and the hands of healthcare providers. The indiscriminate use of drugs and the subsequent rise in drug resistance can contribute to prolonged hospitalization and even death among these individuals. Given that Ahvaz hospitals, particularly Bagai Hospital, serve as primary treatment centers for patients with incurable and cancerous conditions in southwestern Iran, it is of significant value and importance to investigate the resistance patterns observed in patients undergoing chemotherapy and post-transplantation.",

In recent years, there has been a notable increase in interest among researchers in exploring alternative therapeutic methods, including stem cell therapy. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned media (AD-MSCs-CM) on apoptosis induction and migration inhibition of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in vitro. In this study, malignant breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) were cultured separately in DMEM/F12/FBS (15%) culture media under standard conditions. Subsequently, the conditioned media derived from AD-MSCs was introduced to the MDA-MB-231 cells. Following a 24- and 48-hour exposure period, the expression levels of CASP3, KRAS, and MMP9 were evaluated using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration abilities of the cancer cells were evaluated using MTT and wound healing assays, respectively. Furthermore, the protein expression of Caspase-3, K-RAS, and MMP-9 was examined using a western blot assay. It is noteworthy that the expression levels of the MMP9 and KRAS genes were significantly reduced following treatment with AD-MSCs-CM in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the CASP3 gene expression level was found to have increased significantly in the treated groups. Additionally, the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with AD-MSCs-CM was markedly diminished by MTT and wound healing assays. Moreover, the AD-MSCs-CM was observed to induce caspase-3 activation and reduce the protein expression of K-RAS and MMP-9. The results of this study indicate that AD-MSCs-CM may exert an influence on the apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of breast cancer cells. Consequently, it could be proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for the suppression of breast cancer. However, further testing and research are required to validate these findings and to ascertain the full potential of this approach.",

About 90% of instances of pancreatic cancer are pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and occasionally \"pancreatic cancer\" is used exclusively to describe this subtype. Nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and FOLFIRINOX are examples of modern chemotherapeutic drugs that have the ability to quickly confer resistance in pancreatic tumor cells. Therefore, in order to treat this dreadful condition, it is essential to develop more effective medicines. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) causes pancreatic cancer cells to die apoptotically. In eukaryotes, UPS is an essential mechanism for protein breakdown. Pancreatic cancer cells are more susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress) and apoptosis when treated with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is the first in this group of drugs approved for the treatment of cancer, especially multiple myeloma. METHODS: Searching through PubMed and Google Scholar and gathering data. RESULTS: UPS is still a popular target for pancreatic cancer treatment among researchers. However, despite the favorable results of UPS-based therapies in vitro and in vivo, the clinical results are not as promising as expected.

Globally, OV ranks as the seventh most prevalent cancer in women, with an estimated 240,000 new cases annually and being the second most common malignancy among women in Egypt. OBJECTIVES: We investigate the efficacy of cytoreductive surgery in achieving complete tumor removal (R0 resection) in OV, compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. METHOD: This randomized controlled trial at Women Health Hospital, Asyut University, Egypt from 2020 to 2023. Eighty patients were randomized (1:1) to primary surgery (Group I) or NACT (Group II), followed by further randomization (1:1) within each group to bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. The primary outcome was the rate of complete tumor removal (R0 resection). Secondary outcomes included surgical complexity, operative time, complications, and survival rates. RESULTS: Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between the groups (no statistically significant differences). The mean age for group I and group II were (56.3 and 57.23, respectively). Whereas, the BMI for group I and group II were (32.56 and 33.2, respectively). In addition, both groups achieved no significant difference of complete tumor removal (31 vs. 27). However, group II demonstrated significantly shorter operative times (182.34 vs. 219.85 min, p = 0.047), required fewer blood transfusions (9 vs. 21, p value 0.006), and experienced shorter hospital stays (6.13 vs. 11.9 days, p value < 0.001) compared to group I. Notably, no significant differences emerged in complication rates, progression-free survival (11.20 vs. 11.19 months), or overall survival (11.69 vs. 11.76 months) between the groups.

Nearly half (48.4%) of all responses identified challenges related to quality of life, and 39.7% of all responses focused on the challenges of managing the side effects of cancer and its treatment. Managing the economic impact (6.9%) and survival (4.9%) were also identified as challenges by survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors faced a range of challenges from cancer and its treatment. Survivors primarily faced psychosocial challenges, issues with ongoing care, and physical and/or functional sequelae. Managing the economic impact and financial toxicity of cancer treatment and surviving cancer and its treatment were less frequently identified among the challenges faced by survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our analysis highlights the importance of understanding the psychosocial and physical sequelae of cancer and its treatment. Our research helps fill significant gaps in the literature, improving the understanding of rural cancer survivorship. Nuanced understanding of survivors' experiences, using theory-driven qualitative and mixed-methods approaches, will continue to be critical for developing effective, evidence-based practices to meet the needs of survivors.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of ten unique breast cancer subtypes and their clinicopathologic features and treatment implications. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings show that while many subtypes (mucinous, papillary, tubular, apocrine) have favorable biology, with better overall survival than invasive ductal carcinoma, some (metaplastic, adenoid cystic) are more aggressive portending worse prognosis for patients. SUMMARY: The differences in histology represented in these breast cancer subtypes often impacts biology, behavior, and prognosis. Due to their rarity, additional research is needed to implement clear treatment protocols for each subtype.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Molecular docking and dynamics studies to identify novel active compounds targeting potential breast cancer receptor proteins from an indigenous herb Euphorbia thymifolia Linn.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer has become the most prevalent disease and its incidence has almost doubled in the Indian population. This increased burden demands new targeted therapies with novel compounds either synthetically produced or derived from indigenous plants, which could be a promising approach for the development of drugs. Euphorbia thymifolia L is a widely growing tropical herb that has been reported to have various ethnopharmacological properties. Although Euphorbia genus is reported to have anticancer properties, E. thymifolia is not reported to have anticancer properties to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to screen the phytoconstituents and identify the active compounds present in the methanolic extract of E. thymifolia (ME.ET) as ligands to inhibit human cancer cell lines with special reference to potential protein targets implicated in breast cancer using an In-silico approach. METHODS: ME.ET was subjected to GC-MS analysis to screen the phytoconstituents, and the identified compounds were docked with protein targets such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1), a serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT1), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), polo-like kinase-1(PLK1), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK6). Compounds with good docking scores were further subjected to dynamic studies to understand the protein ligand binding stability, ligand pathway calculation, and molecular mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) calculations using the Schrodinger suite. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 245 phytoconstituents, 219 of which were unique. When subjected to docking, these phytocompounds, namely 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl dibenzoate (TTDB) and succinic acid, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 4-isopropylphenyl ester (SADPE), showed good docking scores. Molecular dynamics studies showed a high affinity and low binding energy for TTDB with HER2, ERK1, and SADPE with ER. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, in this study, we identified two lead compounds in E.thymifolia linn. Further invitro and invivo anticancer studies can be performed to confirm these results and to understand the molecular mechanism by which they exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effect on postoperative complications of combined prehabilitation targeting predefined co-existing risky SNAP factors with usual preoperative routines in surgical patients. METHODS: This systematic review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and the protocol (CRD42022282611). Five databases were searched from inception to November 7, 2022 for randomised controlled trials on prehabilitation targeting ≥2 predefined risky lifestyles compared with usual preoperative routines. Risky lifestyles included Smoking, Nutrition (malnutrition and/or BMI>25), risky Alcohol intake, and Physical inactivity (SNAP). Primary outcome was postoperative complications ≤30 days. Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool 2 was used and meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. RESULTS: The search resulted in 20,862 records. At full-text screening, only two (120 participants) of 24 identified trials on combined SNAP intervention had ≥2 predefined risk factors and were included. One (n=110) on intensive physical and brief nutritional intervention to frail patients with colorectal cancer resection reported complication rates of 45% in both groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51). The other study (n=10, subgroup) on intensive alcohol and smoking intervention in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, reported complications in 3/7 vs 3/3 participants. The meta-analysis estimated a RR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.51, I 2 51%). CONCLUSION: Two small of the 24 trials on prehabilitation targeted co-existing and predefined risky SNAP factors and the effect on postoperative complications is very uncertain. Future prehabilitation research involving patient needs is warranted.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Deciphering MARCH5's impact on multiple myeloma: insights into autophagy regulation and AKT-FOXO3 signaling.",
    "AbstractText": "Multiple myeloma (MM) stands as a formidable blood malignancy, necessitating innovative therapeutic approaches. Excessive immunoglobulin production within myeloma cells leads to a buildup of toxic proteins, and autophagy plays a crucial role in their survival by degrading toxic aggregates and generating energy. Membrane-associated RING finger protein 5 (MARCH5) is an E3-ligase positioned at the outer mitochondrial membrane and has been shown to regulate autophagy by competing for MicroRNA 30a (MIR30A). Given the fundamental significance of autophagy in promoting the survival of myeloma cells, coupled with the regulatory role of MARCH5 in autophagic activity, we hypothesized that MARCH5 plays an essential function in MM and holds a pivotal position in the pathogenesis and progression of MM. We identified MARCH5's unique dependencies in MM cells by analyzing the Cancer Dependency Map, thereby establishing its significance in MM biology. Examining various data sets, including CoMMpass (Clinical Outcomes in Multiple Myeloma to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile Study) and HOVON (Haemato-Oncology Foundation for Adults in the Netherlands), demonstrated a correlation between MARCH5 expression and patient outcomes. Knockdown of MARCH5 revealed a substantial reduction in MM cell viability, which was associated with a decrease in autophagic activity. Mechanistically, we unraveled a novel MARCH5/AKT/FOXO3 axis, wherein MARCH5 regulates autophagy through the Protein Kinase B (AKT)-mediated degradation of Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3). Compromised MM cell viability observed with MARCH5 knockdown was recapitulated in FOXO3 knockdown experiments, validating the pivotal role of FOXO3 in mediating MARCH5's effects. In conclusion, this research highlights the crucial role of MARCH5 in MM, and the identified MARCH5/AKT/FOXO3 axis enhances our understanding of MM biology and provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Given the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and the established effectiveness of H. pylori prevention in reducing gastric cancer risk, efforts generally focus on promoting H. pylori screening and risk-reducing dining customs. This study aimed to identify effective fear appeal public service announcements (PSAs) capable of promoting intentions for H. pylori prevention. METHOD: The participants in our experiments were recruited from an online survey platform in China. Experiment 1 employed a 2 (self-oriented threat: present vs. absent) × 2 (other-oriented threat: present vs. absent) × 2 (personal efficacy: present vs. absent) design to assess H. pylori screening intentions. A total of 312 participants were randomly assigned to eight conditions. Experiment 2 utilized a 2 (self-oriented threat: present vs. absent) × 2 (other-oriented threat: present vs. absent) × 2 (efficacy types: personal vs. collective) design to evaluate intentions to use separate serving chopsticks as the risk-reducing dining custom, with 293 participants randomly assigned to eight conditions. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, positive effects were observed for self-oriented threat, other-oriented threat, and personal efficacy in fear appeal PSAs on H. pylori screening intention. The three-way interaction effect revealed that the effects of fear appeal PSAs on H. pylori screening intentions depended on the presence of other-oriented threat. In Experiment 2, fear appeal PSAs with a collective efficacy message elicited higher intentions to use separate serving chopsticks than PSAs with a self-efficacy message. CONCLUSIONS: Fear appeal PSAs aimed at promoting H. pylori prevention could highlight other-oriented threat and collective efficacy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is the first-line treatment for intermediate-advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although its outcomes vary. This study aimed to identify imaging biomarkers of immunotherapy susceptibility linked to gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) and immune phenotypes, particularly immune-excluded phenotypes, with a tumor immune barrier. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining with a CD8+ antibody, and samples were classified into immune-inflamed, -intermediate, -excluded, and -ignored phenotypes. We assessed EOB-MRI findings obtained from 104 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC and evaluated the relationship between MRI findings and immune phenotype. Spatial transcriptome analysis of tumor tissues in each immune phenotype was performed to characterize the MRI findings. For validation, we analyzed the treatment effect on 60 nodules in another cohort of 27 patients who received combined immunotherapy using anti-programmed death-ligand 1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies. RESULTS: HCCs with rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) (odds ratio [OR] 17.3, p = 0.009), peritumoral enhancement in the arterial phase (OR: 8.6, p < 0.004), and intermediate intensity on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) measured with a visual 3-point scale (OR: 28.2, p = 0.002) were associated with immune-excluded phenotype, where tumors tended to be larger and of the single nodular type with extranodular growth and confluent multinodular rather than the simple nodular type. Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed a spatial relationship among cytotoxic T lymphocytes, VEGF signals, and cancer-associated fibroblasts at the tumor-invasive margins in this phenotype. From the validation study, nodules with any one of these three imaging findings had a significantly prolonged time to-nodular progression (p = 0.007, median not reached vs. 226 days). CONCLUSION: HCCs with rim APHE, peritumoral enhancement in arterial phase, and intermediate intensity on HBP with visual 3-point scale could be non-invasive biomarkers to predict the immune-excluded phenotype with the tumor immune barrier. These HCCs were most likely to respond to combined immunotherapy.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: In the realm of oncology, the pinnacle of therapeutic success is achieving a state where the patient is entirely free of cancer, i.e., \"cancer free.\" This benchmark should not only apply to early-stage malignancies but should also be the standard aim for advanced-stage diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is a glaring gap in the research landscape concerning the understanding of what cancer-free status truly means for advanced-stage HCC. Our study sheds light on the profound implications of reaching a cancer-free by radiologic assessments in patients with advanced-stage HCC. METHODS: We established a database tracking the full clinical course of all patients with HCC (from 2003 to 2022). We identified the initial instances of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. We defined radiologic cancer-free (rCF) as cases in which no recurrence was observed for at least 2 months following curative treatment or complete response to systemic therapies. The frequency of achieving rCF status was investigated, categorized by patients' background. RESULTS: We identified 795 patients with advanced-stage HCC. The rCF rate was 8.7%. Patients who achieved rCF status had significantly better prognoses compared to those who did not (p < 0.001). In the decision tree analysis, the number of tumors ≥8 was the strongest factor, making it difficult to achieve rCF status. Analysis of stage progression patterns revealed varying background characteristics at the time of advanced-stage diagnosis, with discrepancies in rCF rates. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low rate of achieving rCF status, the prognostic impact was significant. Patients with certain tumor characteristics had a higher likelihood of achieving rCF status. The distribution of tumor conditions varies based on the pattern of progression, which affects the likelihood of achieving an rCF status.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Although medical cannabis (MC) has been shown to relieve cancer- and treatment-related symptoms, there is increasing misinformation regarding its antitumor efficacy. We aimed to identify opportunities for oncologists to communicate evidence-based guidance to patients regarding its use. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with cancer seen in radiation oncology clinic between June 2022 and July 2023 were surveyed with a questionnaire regarding their perceptions and information sources of MC. Associations between survey responses and demographic and disease variables were evaluated. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on narrative responses in search of common themes. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients (84% completion rate) were included in the analysis. Most (83.3%) strongly agreed or agreed that MC can provide symptom relief, whereas a subset of patients (15.5%) strongly agreed or agreed that MC can cure cancer. This latter subcohort was significantly more likely to identify as Hispanic/Latino (38.5% vs 9.9%, P = .009) and less likely to be up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations (30.8% vs 8.5%, P = 0.044). Identifying as Hispanic/Latino remained significantly associated with strongly agreeing or agreeing that MC can cure cancer on bivariate analysis (odds ratio, 6.528; 95% CI, 1.477-28.715; P = .012). Education level, other sociodemographic characteristics, and sources for information about MC were not significantly different between these patients. Thematic analysis revealed that patients hoped to learn more about MC from their oncologists but perceived them to be unknowledgeable on the subject. CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients consider MC to be a valuable addition to conventional therapies for managing refractory symptoms, a subset believed it had potential as an anticancer therapy. Many patients rely on unregulated sources, highlighting the need for providers to address misinformation, bridge knowledge gaps, and clarify its use.",

    "AbstractText": "Formaldehyde (HCHO) is an important air pollutant with direct cancer risk and ozone-forming potential. HCHO sources are complex because HCHO is both directly emitted and produced from oxidation of most gas-phase reactive organic carbon. We update the secondary production of HCHO in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Production of HCHO from isoprene and monoterpenes is increased, correcting an underestimate in the current version. Simulated June-August surface HCHO during peak photochemical production (11:00-15:00 LT, local time) increased by 0.6 ppb (32 %) over the southeastern USA and by 0.2 ppb (13 %) over the contiguous USA. The increased HCHO compares more favorably with satellite-based observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and from aircraft-based observations. Evaluation against hourly surface observations indicates a missing nighttime sink that can be improved by increased nighttime deposition, which reduces June-August nocturnal (20:00-04:00 LT) surface HCHO by 1.1 ppb (36 %) over the southeastern USA and 0.5 ppb (29 %) over the contiguous USA. The ability of CRACMM to capture peak levels of HCHO at midday is improved, particularly at sites in the northeastern USA, while peak levels at sites in the southeastern USA are improved, although still lower than observed. Using established risk assessment methods, lifetime exposure of the population in the contiguous USA (~320 million) to ambient HCHO levels predicted here may result in 6200 lifetime cancer cases, with 40 % from controllable anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides and reactive organic compounds.

Enitociclib inhibited the phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II at Ser2/Ser5 and repressed the protein expression of oncogenes c-Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in MM cells. Additionally, enitociclib demonstrated synergistic effects with several anti-MM agents, including bortezomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and venetoclax.

    "AbstractText": "Causal mediation, pleiotropy, and replication analyses are three highly popular genetic study designs. Although these analyses address different scientific questions, the underlying statistical inference problems all involve large-scale testing of composite null hypotheses. The goal is to determine whether all null hypotheses - as opposed to at least one - in a set of individual tests should simultaneously be rejected. Recently, various methods have been proposed for each of these situations, including an appealing two-group empirical Bayes approach that calculates local false discovery rates (lfdr). However, lfdr estimation is difficult due to the need for multivariate density estimation. Furthermore, the multiple testing rules for the empirical Bayes lfdr approach can disagree with conventional frequentist z-statistics, which is troubling for a field that ubiquitously utilizes summary statistics. This work proposes a framework to unify two-group testing in genetic association composite null settings, the conditionally symmetric multidimensional Gaussian mixture model (csmGmm). The csmGmm is shown to demonstrate more robust operating characteristics than recently-proposed alternatives. Crucially, the csmGmm also offers interpretability guarantees by harmonizing lfdr and z-statistic testing rules. We extend the base csmGmm to cover each of the mediation, pleiotropy, and replication settings, and we prove that the lfdr z-statistic agreement holds in each situation. We apply the model to a collection of translational lung cancer genetic association studies that motivated this work.",

Patients face a higher risk of mortality in the period of transition from failing allograft to dialysis. Long term risk of cardiovascular complications and risk of infections and cancer with use of long-term immune suppression contribute to poor outcomes. Patients with failing transplants appear to have poorer control of CKD complications and are more likely to initiate hemodialysis using a catheter. Outcomes of peritoneal dialysis in the setting of the failing allograft in general are equivalent to hemodialysis. Management of these patients in transplant center clinics specifically focused on patients with failing allografts may have benefit, but maximal utility has yet to be demonstrated. Patients with failed transplants can have a survival benefit with retransplant, even in older patients. There may not be a benefit to retransplant in patients older than 70 years of age. Patients with failing renal grafts should be assessed as to whether they are potential candidates for retransplant prior to needing to start dialysis to allow for identification of a living kidney donor or to be listed as soon a possible on the kidney transplant wait list as to minimize the wait time on dialysis. Decisions regarding reduction of immunosuppression once the patient has started dialysis should be made with guidance from the transplant center in the context of patient-centric factors such as candidacy for retransplant and minimizing complications of long-term immunosuppression.",

The rise of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy as the favored surgical approach emphasizes the significance of localization studies. This study aims to explore clinical and laboratory profiles of PHP patients and evaluate the efficacy of diverse localization methods in a substantial patient cohort. METHODS: We analyzed clinical features, biochemical parameters, and imaging outcomes for localization, as well as postoperative histopathological findings in 327 diagnosed PHP patients who underwent surgery. Initial localization methods, which included ultrasonography (US), US-guided Parathormone (PTH) washout analysis, and 99mTechnetium-Sestamibi/123Iodine Scintigraphy (MIBI-SPECT/CT), were applied to all patients. Advanced techniques like Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography (4D-CT) and 18F-Fluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FCH PET/CT) were used for cases where initial methods failed and/or for secondary intervention. RESULTS: Minimally invasive surgery accounted for 74% (n=241) of cases. Histopathological analysis revealed single adenoma in 94.5% (n=309) patients, hyperplasia in 5.2% (n=17), and cancer in 0.3% (n=1). Adenoma volume showed a significant positive correlation with serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (p<0.001). 82 and 26 cases required 4D-CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT respectively, for localization. Positive predictive values (PPV) for imaging modalities were: US (84.56%), US-guided PTH-washout analysis (87.30%), MIBI-SPECT/CT (92.1%), 4D-CT (81.94%), and 18F-FCH PET/CT (95.83%). CONCLUSION: Serum calcium and PTH levels estimate adenoma size. Initial localization studies (i.e.US, PTH washout and, MIBI-SPECT/CT) effectively localized most adenomas. 4D-CT showed notable efficacy, and 18F-FCH PET/CT had the highest PPV for adenoma localization when the initial studies failed.",

Sanger sequencing was used to validate the familial heredity. For the novel variant, protein predictive analysis was performed to study the changes of secondary and tertiary structures and hydrophobicity. RESULTS: A 45 years old male (proband, III-1) was diagnosed as PBMAH. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed, finding one mutation: c.719_ 724dup, p Arg240_ Pro241dup. Sanger sequencing showed the II-2, III-1, IV-1 with heterozygous gene, confirming the familial heredity. For protein predictive analysis, the predicted secondary structure of variants has one alpha-helix structure incomplete compared with normal ARMC5.

Among the remaining 60 patients, 30 underwent MR in-bore biopsy followed by systematic biopsy (study arm A) and 30 underwent systematic biopsy only (study arm B). Results  The mean PSA range of study population ( n  = 60 patients) was 4.2 to 72.7 ng/mL. Twenty-seven patients had a PI-RADS score of 4, and 33 patients had a PI-RADS score of 5. Among 60 patients, 30 had prostate carcinoma on biopsy, of which 18 were clinically significant prostate cancers (csPCa). In study arm A, TRUS-guided systematic biopsy had a lower sensitivity (0.9) for detection of csPCa compared with MR in-bore biopsy (1.0) with overdetection of insignificant cancers (sensitivity: 0.89 vs. 0.56). TRUS-guided biopsy yielded 112 positive cores out of 360, whereas MR in-bore biopsy yielded 15 positive cores out of 30 (31.1 vs. 50%; p  = 0.03). On comparison of study arms A and B, the diagnostic yield for detection of both prostate cancer and csPCa were high in study arm A (60 vs. 40%, and 33.3 vs. 26.7%, respectively) Conclusion  MRI in-bore targeted biopsy had a greater sensitivity to detect csPCa with fewer number of biopsy cores and lower sensitivity to detect insignificant cancers compared with systematic biopsy. Systematic biopsies were associated with overdetection of clinically insignificant cancers.",

    "AbstractText": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common thyroid cancer with a good prognosis. However, local recurrence or cervical lymph node metastasis is frequent. Reoperation is a standard treatment but may be challenging due to the formation of fibrosis, cervical anatomy distortion, and the small size of recurrent lesions. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive modality for recurrent thyroid cancer in high-risk patients or those who refuse surgery. Here, we describe the case of a 41-year-old woman who underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection because of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Follow-up ultrasonography 14 months after the second surgery revealed two abnormal lymph nodes in the right neck at level VI. She underwent RFA of the lymph nodes. Eighteen months after RFA, the metastasis lymph nodes disappeared completely.",

    "AbstractText": "Objective  The aim of this study was to explore an innovative approach for developing deep learning (DL) algorithm for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) detection and subtyping on computed tomography (CT): clear cell RCC (ccRCC) versus non-ccRCC using two-dimensional (2D) neural network architecture and feature consistency modules. Materials and Methods  This retrospective study included baseline CT scans from 196 histopathologically proven RCC patients: 143 ccRCCs and 53 non-ccRCCs. Manual tumor annotations were performed on axial slices of corticomedullary phase images, serving as ground truth. After image preprocessing, the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. The study tested multiple 2D DL architectures, with the FocalNet-DINO demonstrating highest effectiveness in detecting and classifying RCC. The study further incorporated spatial and class consistency modules to enhance prediction accuracy. Models' performance was evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristic curves, recall rates, specificity, accuracy, F1 scores, and area under the curve (AUC) scores. Results  The FocalNet-DINO architecture achieved the highest recall rate of 0.823 at 0.025 false positives per image (FPI) for RCC detection. The integration of spatial and class consistency modules into the architecture led to 0.2% increase in recall rate at 0.025 FPI, along with improvements of 0.1% in both accuracy and AUC scores for RCC classification. These enhancements allowed detection of cancer in an additional 21 slices and reduced false positives in 126 slices. Conclusion  This study demonstrates high performance for RCC detection and classification using DL algorithm leveraging 2D neural networks and spatial and class consistency modules, to offer a novel, computationally simpler, and accurate DL approach to RCC characterization.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Prognostic factors in gallbladder cancer: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the most common biliary cancers and is characterized by its high malignancy. Moreover, the incidence of GBC has been increasing over the decades, partly due to advancements in diagnostic techniques and devices. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of factors influencing the prognosis of GBC. We aim to identify and evaluate both established and controversial prognostic factors, including lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), adjuvant therapy, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA199), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumor mutation status, surgical margins, the presence of gallstones, and jaundice. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of eligible studies in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Our analysis focused on data from GBC patients who had undergone surgical resection, with the primary outcome being overall survival. Forest plots were generated using hazard ratios (HRs) to visualize the effect sizes, and the Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies (QUIPS) tool was employed to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: This study synthesized data from 52 studies, encompassing a total of 23,174 patients over the period of 2000 to 2022. Notably, several factors significantly influenced the outcomes of GBC, including LMR (HR =2.17), CEA (HR =1.81), CA199 (HR =1.56), lymph node stage (HR =2.03), T stage (HR =2.37), presence of invasion (HR =1.74), tumor location (HR =1.42), and surgical margins (HR =2.66). Additionally, chemotherapy (HR =0.75) and radiotherapy (HR =0.56) demonstrated marked improvements in overall survival compared to control arms. Jaundice and the presence of gallstones were not defined as independent predictors, as they reflect advanced stage symptoms in GBC. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this comprehensive review offer valuable insights into the assessment of the necessity for aggressive treatment approaches and the prognostication of GBC patients. Furthermore, there is a need for well-designed, ongoing studies to further advance our understanding of this challenging malignancy.",

Due to their immunogenicity, bacteria have been developed as drug-delivery vehicles in cancer immunotherapy. However, ensuring the safety and efficacy of this approach poses a considerable challenge. This paper comprehensively explains the fundamental processes and synthesis principles involved in immunotherapy utilizing engineered bacteria. Initially, we list common engineered strains and discuss that growth control through genetic mutation promises therapeutic safety. By considering the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and the interaction of specific molecules, the precision targeting of tumors can be improved. Furthermore, we present a foundational paradigm for genetic circuit construction to achieve controlled gene activation and logical expression, directly determining drug synthesis and release. Finally, we review the immunogenicity, the expression of immunomodulatory factors, the delivery of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the utilization of bacteria as tumor vaccines to stimulate the immune system and facilitate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary carcinoid tumors (PCTs) have historically manifested predominantly as central lung lesions causing postobstructive symptoms. However, nearly all case series of PCTs to date evaluate cohorts in years before 2010. Because an increased volume of cross-sectional imaging studies results in more frequent detection of incidental lung nodules, we sought to evaluate whether the nature of this cancer's clinical characteristics may be evolving by studying a contemporary series of patients. METHODS: The study analyzed all patients with a diagnosis of PCT at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (Philadelphia, PA) between 2006 and 2020. The study evaluated tumor location within the bronchial tree (ie, central or peripheral), the presence or absence of symptoms at diagnosis, patient demographics, and nodule characteristics on computed tomography. RESULTS: A total of 73 PCTs were analyzed in 72 patients. Most PCTs were detected incidentally (48 of 72; 95% CI: 55%-77%) and located peripherally (41 of 67; 95% CI: 49%-73%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the likelihood of PCTs having these features increased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: PCTs manifested predominantly as peripheral lung lesions detected incidentally on computed tomography, which contrasts with the existing literature. This may reflect the changing nature of PCT diagnosis as cross-sectional imaging volume has increased. Clinicians should be mindful that incidental solitary pulmonary nodules detected on chest imaging may represent PCT, especially if the lesions are slow growing.",

This study aimed to analyze outcomes with sublobar resection in patients with clinical T1N0M0 LCNEC (<3 cm) compared with lobectomy. METHODS: We performed a single-institution, retrospective study comparing patients undergoing lobectomy vs sublobar resection (segmentectomy or wedge resection) for clinical T1N0M0 LCNEC from 2002 2022. We performed unmatched and propensity-matched comparisons for overall survival and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: During the study period, 62 lobectomies and 34 sublobar resections (20 segmentectomies and 14 wedge resections) were performed for clinical T1N0M0 LCNEC. Correct pre-/intraoperative histologic diagnosis was made only for 21 patients receiving lobectomy (33.9%) and 10 patients receiving sublobar resection (29.4%). In the unmatched cohort, there was no difference in overall survival (median, 65.6 vs 65.4 months; P = .133) and recurrence-free survival (median, 36.9 vs 31.1 months; P = .210). Sublobar resection was associated with a higher locoregional recurrence rate (44.1% vs 14.5%; P = .003), while the overall recurrence rate was not significantly different (50.0% vs 37.1%; P = .280). In the matched cohort with 22 patients on each arm, there was no difference in overall survival (median, 65.6 vs 57.8 months; P = .308) and recurrence-free survival (median 27.1 vs 20.4 months; P = .290). CONCLUSIONS: LCNEC is a diagnostic challenge with pre-/intra-operative biopsy. For cT1N0M0 LCNEC, even though the survival was not inferior, sublobar resection could be inferior in long-term locoregional disease control. An individualized approach is warranted in case LCNEC is diagnosed after sublobar resection.",

To reduce the delay between diagnosis and treatment, we initiated a Robotic One Anesthetic Diagnosis and Treatment (ROADAT) program for lung nodules that combined robotic navigational bronchoscopy, liquid rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), and surgical resection in the same setting. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent the ROADAT procedure from December 1, 2021, through January 31, 2024. These patients were compared with sequential controls from the same time window, who would have been ROADAT candidates but underwent diagnosis and treatment using a standard lung nodule workup. RESULTS: There were 36 patients in the ROADAT group and 35 controls. Of the 36 ROADAT patients, 31 (86%) underwent lung resections. When final pathology was available, ROSE was concordant in 91% (29 of 32) of cases. Compared with robotic lobectomies alone, ROADAT procedures that resulted in lobectomies added 73 minutes (P = .003). However, total operating room time for when lobectomy and biopsy were done in separate settings was 54 minutes shorter in the ROADAT group (P = .028). Direct (ROADAT, $19,244; controls, $21,737; P = .004) procedure costs and total (ROADAT, $26,668; controls, $29,882; P = .005) procedure costs were lower in the ROADAT group for patients who underwent lobectomy. Time from detection to resection was 35 days shorter in the ROADAT group (ROADAT, 82 days; controls, 117 days; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The ROADAT procedure reduced time from nodule detection to surgical resection compared with the standard approach. Liquid-based ROSE had high concordance with final pathology. Total operative time, direct costs, and total costs were lower for the ROADAT procedure.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Clinicoradiologic Predictors of Anastomotic Complications After Bronchoplasty for Lung Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: We investigated the predictive factors for anastomotic complications in sleeve lobectomy for lung cancer. METHODS: Between February 2008 and April 2023, 196 patients underwent sleeve lobectomy for lung cancer; 140 were included after exclusion of those who underwent extended sleeve lobectomy and salvage surgery after definitive chemoradiotherapy. Clinicopathologic and computed tomography (CT) findings were retrospectively investigated, and predictors of anastomotic complications were analyzed. The CT finding of azygos arch invasion was defined as a compression or stenosis of the azygos arch by the tumor. RESULTS: Lobectomy types were right upper lobectomy in 71 patients, right lower lobectomy in 5, left upper lobectomy in 53, and left lower lobectomy in 11. CT finding of azygos arch invasion was detected in 21 cases. Anastomotic coverage was performed in 41. Bronchial anastomotic complications were observed in 11 patients (7.9%), including 9 with an anastomotic fistula and 2 with stenosis, all of which were on the right side. Only right upper sleeve lobectomy was a significant predictor of anastomotic complications (odds ratio, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.07-26.13). In 71 cases of right upper sleeve lobectomy, anastomotic complications were significantly more frequent (33.3% vs 4.0%; P < .01) and predictive of anastomotic complications when tumor invasion into the azygos arch was detected on CT (odds ratio, 12.00; 95% CI, 2.24-64.42). CONCLUSIONS: Right upper sleeve lobectomy is a predictor of anastomotic complications. Particular attention should be paid to anastomotic complications in right upper sleeve lobectomy with suspected tumor invasion of the azygos arch on CT.",

Single-anesthesia robotic navigational bronchoscopy with biopsy and lung resection (SABR) was developed to mitigate delay. We report outcomes, wait times, and cost effectiveness of this approach vs staggered robotic navigational bronchoscopy followed by resection. METHODS: Patients undergoing SABR or staggered biopsy and resection between April 2020 and May 2023 were included. Demographic and procedural characteristics were collected for both groups. Time from clinic and biopsy to operation, length of stay, and inpatient complications were captured. Direct, indirect, and total costs, adjusted to 2023 dollars, were measured for each case. RESULTS: The study included 40 patients in the SABR group and 30 patients in the staggered group. Baseline clinical characteristics including pathologic stage were similar between the groups. No difference was found in rates of complications. Time from clinic to resection was 26.5 days in the SABR group and 41.5 days in the staggered group (P = .001). Time from biopsy to resection was 0 days for the SABR group, whereas it was 17 days for the staggered group (P < .001).

We sought to identify preoperative predictors of HH needs for these patients. METHODS: This was a single-institution, retrospective analysis of patients undergoing elective, nonambulatory thoracic surgical procedures from January 2017 through June 2021. Operations were categorized as \"lung,\" \"esophagus\" or \"other.\" We analyzed and compared preoperative characteristics, intraoperative events, and postoperative complications between HH and No-HH cohorts, including a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify preoperative predictors for HH need. RESULTS: We identified 429 patients, with 324 patients (75.5%) discharged without HH and 105 patients (24.5%) discharged with HH. The average length of stay for the No-HH cohort was 3.5 days compared with the HH group of 7.9 days (P < .0001). Multivariable analysis revealed age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.10-1.16), clinical cancer stage II (aOR, 6.40; 95% CI, 2.13-19.23), and clinical cancer stage III and higher (aOR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.12-13.84), preoperative opioid use (aOR, 10.30; 95% CI, 2.24-47.35), higher case mix index (CMI) score (aOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.26-2.35), and esophageal operation (aOR, 18.75; 95% C,I 4.70-74.81) as significantly associated with the need for HH. CONCLUSIONS: We identified older age, advanced clinical cancer stage, preoperative opioid use, higher CMI score, and esophageal operation as predictors of the need for HH services.

Survivors struggle with daily activities after decannulation and discharge. We evaluated outcomes after implementing a survivorship approach based on a cancer survivorship clinic model to improve quality of life (QoL) and optimize resource consumption. METHODS: We established a multidisciplinary survivorship clinic using telehealth and in-person physical and occupational therapy teams. Data from the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) were collected between 2020 and 2023. Interviews were conducted at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after decannulation. The patients were offered in-person and telephone-based counseling with scheduled inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation visits. SF-12 mental component summary (MCS-12) and physical component summary (PCS-12) scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The relationship between QoL, costs, and length of stay outcomes was assessed using generalized linear and mixed models. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were monitored for 3 years. Mean age was 41.7 years, 98.1% were White, and 50.9% were men. At 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, mean MSC-12 scores were 52.9, 50, and 49.7, PCS-12 scores were 43.7, 41.8, and 47.3, and QALYs were 0.837, 0.829, and 0.826, respectively. MCS-12 showed no significant difference from the United States population. PCS-12 was significantly lower than the United States population during the first and second evaluations (P < .001) but showed no difference at 36 months. QALYs were significantly higher (P < .001). Higher resource consumption was associated with lower PCS-12 scores and QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: The survivorship approach with counseling and rehabilitation yields acceptable QoL, which may inform strategies to improve the cost-effectiveness of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",

    "AbstractText": "Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is overexpressed in various tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and is rarely expressed in normal tissues. These characteristics make DDR1 a preferable target candidate for the construction of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for targeted therapy. Here, we investigated the preparation and preclinical efficacy of DDR1-DX8951, an ADC that includes an anti-DDR1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to DX8951 by a cleavable Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly (GGFG) linker. The anti-DDR1 monoclonal antibody was coupled to DX8951 (i.e., DDR1-DX8951), producing the targeted therapy ADC. The antitumor activities of DDR1-DX8951 monotherapy or DDR1-DX8951 plus pembrolizumab were assessed in TNBC mouse models. DDR1-DX8951 can specifically target DDR1, be quickly internalized by TNBC cells, and reduce the viability of TNBC cells in vitro. The potent antitumor activity of DDR1-DX8951 was revealed in TNBC xenograft models. Importantly, our investigation demonstrated that DDR1-DX8951 plus pembrolizumab not only revealed the inhibitory efficacy on tumor growth and metastasis but also played an important role in improving the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of TNBC. Taken together, this investigation provides justification for large-sample studies to further assess the safety and efficacy of DDR1-DX8951 plus pembrolizumab for TNBC clinical trials.",

    "AbstractText": "The well-documented protumorigenic roles of macrophages in advanced cancers can sometimes overshadow their beneficial functions in the earlier stages of tumor development. This essay explores the hypothesis that macrophages play a crucial protective role in premalignant tissues by sensing and responding to early oncogenic transformation. Their activity is closely intertwined with cell-intrinsic barriers to transformation - such as apoptosis, senescence, and DNA repair - which collectively work to suppress malignant progression. Thus, an integrated cell-intrinsic and macrophage response constitutes effective 'oncogenic monitoring'. In premalignant tissues, macrophages interpret outputs of cell-intrinsic tumor suppression as oncogenic stress signals detected through innate immune sensors, initiating a protective, homeostatic response that mitigates potential progression to malignancy. By recontextualizing macrophage roles in the early immune landscape, it becomes evident that these cells can serve as key protectors, preventing or delaying tumor formation. Understanding this dual role of macrophages - protective in early tumorigenesis and protumorigenic in established cancers - offers new perspectives on harnessing their immune functions for cancer prevention and therapy.",

Therefore, this study made an effort to know health-seeking behavior among delayed cancer patients receiving treatment at a tertiary care hospital, Varanasi. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Surgical Oncology OPD, Sir Sunder Lal Hospital, IMS, BHU, Varanasi. Randomly selected 440 registered patients were interviewed with the help of semi-structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analysis and 2-test were used in this study. RESULTS: Out of total 440 patients included in this study, 207 (47.05%) were males and 233 (52.95%) were females. The majority (59.32%) of patients were more than 45 years of age group. Most (80%) of the patients had delay in cancer treatment of more than 60 days from onset of symptoms. Only 29.55% of patients were aware of any symptoms of Cancer. Those patients who were doing self-medication (P=0.03) and did not attend any cancer screening program (P=0.04) showed a statistically significant association with delayed initiation of treatment. Patients referred from another centre (P = 0.03) also show a significant association with delayed treatment initiation. Cancer patients who visited the screening program (AOR= 0.22, P=0.003) were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of delayed treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: The study showed that 80% of patients were delayed in seeking treatment for Cancer and highly influenced by low awareness, self-medication and visiting multiple health centres for diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, there is a strong need to address the reasons for the delay in seeking treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Axillary sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE) in breast cancer patients with clinically node-negative disease may be carried out using different tracers. The standard tracer is technetium colloid ( 99m Tc). Indocyanine green (ICG) can be used as an alternative. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this fluorescent dye in a standardized setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center cohort study carried out at the University Gynecological Hospital of Rostock from September 2023 to May 2024 carried out sentinel lymph node marking using only ICG in patients with breast malignancies. The ICG injection was administered immediately after the induction of anesthesia. Detection of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) was done using a laparoscopy system suitable for ICG. The aim was to determine the detection rate (DR) for SLNs marked exclusively using ICG and to record any complications. The costs of using ICG to mark SLNs were compared with those for 99m Tc marking. RESULTS: During the study period, contraindications against marking with ICG were ascertained for five (3.8%) of 132 patients with planned SLNE. A total of 100 SLNEs were carried out after ICG marking in patients who met the inclusion criteria in the context of the study. A median of two SLNs were resected. The detection rate (DR) for SLNs was 98.0%. SLNs were identified in all obese patients. No serious systemic side effects occurred following ICG injection. Transient skin discoloration in the area around the injection site were observed in eight patients. The direct cost of ICG marking was 62.73 Euros, which was 170.36 Euros lower than the cost of 99m Tc marking. CONCLUSION: The detection rate of axillary SLNs marked using ICG is high and the method is cost-effective, has few side effects and can also be used in obese patients. Contraindications against the administration of ICG are rare. Marking with ICG is a good alternative to the 99m Tc method and offers advantages in terms of costs, logistics, no exposure to radiation, and patient comfort.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Gastric Cancer Genetics and Its Implications for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment of the Disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Gastric cancer (GC) is an aggressive disease and the fifth most common cancer worldwide with a variable geographical distribution. GC has a very low survival rate, mainly because of its heterogeneous presentation, multifactorial etiology, and late diagnosis. It is well established that various risk factors contribute to the development of the disease, including salty diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. Importantly, interactions between genetic and environmental traits trigger the activation of key signaling pathways, influencing gastric cell behavior towards neoplastic transformation and progression. Despite important advances in our understanding of GC, it remains a major health burden owing to epidemiological and therapeutic limitations. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic landscape of GC phenotypes and molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. In particular, we discuss the advances in genomic knowledge and technology that have yielded comprehensive information on the genetics of GC and classified it from a histological to a molecular perspective. Therefore, targeted and immune-based therapies have been developed, highlighting the challenges associated with intratumoral and interpatient heterogeneity. Finally, we explored potential research avenues on the intricacies of GC and identified accurate biomarkers for improved cancer screening and stratification. The development of innovative approaches to tackle relevant molecules is needed for GC management.",

    "AbstractText": "Viral infections of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract are not uncommon in clinical practice; however, these are frequently observed in immunocompromised patients and rarely in immunocompetent hosts. Compared with esophagitis, which may be associated with clinically significant outcomes, the stomach is a relatively rare site for opportunistic infections in immunocompetent patients. The most common clinically relevant upper GI tract viral infections include cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplex virus infections. CMV esophagitis and gastritis, which primarily occur in immunocompromised patients, necessitate antiviral treatment, whereas immunocompetent patients typically respond to proton pump inhibitor administration. Most EBV-induced gastric infections are asymptomatic. However, EBV infection is a known etiological contributor to stomach cancer. EBV-associated gastric cancer shows distinctive clinical, pathological, genetic, and post-genetic mutation features and is therefore a clinically significant entity. Herpetic esophagitis usually affects immunocompromised patients and is uncommon in immunocompetent individuals. In this review, we discuss the general aspects and recent studies that have reported esophageal and gastric infections in immunocompromised patients.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Huangqin decoction inhibits colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation by improving gut microbiome-mediated metabolic dysfunction.",
    "AbstractText": "Colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation poses a major risk to patients with colitis. Patients with chronic intestinal inflammation have an approximately 2-3 folds increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Unfortunately, there is currently no effective intervention available. Huangqin decoction (HQD), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, is frequently clinically prescribed for treating patients with colitis, and its active ingredients have effective antitumour efficacy. Nonetheless, the mechanism of HQD-mediated prevention of colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation remains unclear. A strategy integrating metagenomic, lipidomic, and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing analysis was used to investigate the regulatory effects of HQD on the gut microbiome, metabolism and potential mechanisms involved in colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation. Our study revealed that HQD suppressed colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation, which was associated with enhanced intestinal barrier function, decreased the inflammatory response, and regulation of the gut microbiome. Notably, cohousing experiments revealed that the transfer of the gut microbiome from HQD-treated mice largely inhibited the pathological transformation of colitis. Moreover, gut microbiome transfer from HQD-treated mice primarily resulted in the altered regulation of fatty acid metabolism, especially the remodeling of arachidonic acid metabolism, which was associated with the amelioration of pathological transformation. Arachidonic acid metabolism and the key metabolic enzyme arachidonic acid 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) were affected by HQD treatment, and no obvious protective effect of HQD was observed in Alox 12 -/- mice, which revealed that ALOX12 was a critical mediator of HQD protection against colorectal inflammatory cancer transformation. In summary, multiple omics analyses were applied to produce valuable data and theoretical support for the application of HQD as a promising intervention for the transformation of inflammatory CRC.",

    "AbstractText": "Gastric cancer is a significant health problem owing to its high incidence and mortality rate. The risk factors for gastric cancer include both uncontrollable (e.g., age, sex, and genetic predisposition) and controllable factors (e.g., Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and high-salt diets). Although treatment of H. pylori infections has been implemented as a primary preventive measure, the risk of gastric cancer may persist, highlighting the need for additional preventive measures. This review discusses various risks and protective factors associated with gastric cancer, studies conducted on these factors, and chemoprevention. Smoking is a risk factor for this disease; thus, is not recommended and current smokers are encouraged to quit because cessation can reduce the risk of gastric cancer. Excessive alcohol intake has been reported to increase the risk of gastric cancer as has the consumption of high-salt foods that can damage the gastric mucosa. Additionally, increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables, known for their protective effects against gastric cancer, can aid in its prevention. Studies on chemopreventive agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin), statins, and metformin, have been reported; however, evidence of their effectiveness remains insufficient to recommend these agents as preventive treatments. Additional well-planned studies on preventive medications and dietary approaches are necessary.",

Cancers of the EGJ and gastric cardia have poor prognoses. This study aimed to investigate lymph node metastasis (LNM) rates, their predictive factors, and determine the long-term outcomes of patients with Siewert type II/III early gastric cancer (EGC). METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2022, a total of 573 patients with gastric cancer, including 130 with Siewert type II/III EGC, underwent total gastrectomies at the Kosin University Gospel Hospital. Factors associated with LNM were analyzed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 130 patients with Siewert type II/III EGC, 10 (7.7%) demonstrated LNM (LNM-positive group). Macroscopically elevated lesions (I+IIa) (60.0% vs. 16.7%; p=0.009) and lymphovascular invasion (70.0% vs. 5.8%; p<0.001) were more common and the depth of invasion was deeper (p=0.003) in the LNM-positive patients than in the LNMnegative group. Multivariate analysis showed that macroscopically elevated lesions (odds ratio [OR], 19.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93-197.11; p=0.012) and lymphovascular invasion (OR, 52.63; 95% CI, 5.26-526.51; p=0.001) were associated with LNM. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rates of patients with Siewert type II/III EGC were 90.0% and 98.9%, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 49 months (range, 12-122 months), one patient (0.8%) died owing to gastric cancer recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Siewert type II/III EGC showed favorable long-term outcomes. Macroscopically elevated lesions and lymphovascular invasion are associated with LNM.",

    "AbstractText": "Gastric cancer (GC), a significant cause of mortality globally, is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Latin American men. GC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage; therefore, therapeutic options are limited, and prognosis is poor. Helicobacter pylori infection remains the primary risk factor for GC; therefore, primary prevention directed toward diagnosis and treatment (\"test-and-treat\" strategy) is important. Western medicine guidelines recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for at-risk individuals aged >40 years with regular surveillance in patients with gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC). However, limited availability of EGD in Latin America necessitates development of risk stratification tools to minimize the endoscopic burden. Results from the Chilean \"Endoscopic Cohort and Histological Operative Link on Gastric Assessment (OLGA) Staging\" (ECHOS study), propose endoscopic surveillance of advanced GPMC (OLGA/Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia [OLGIM] stages III-IV) with reliable risk stratification to facilitate early GC detection. Ensuring high-quality EGD and enhanced diagnostic yield of GPMC is essential. GPMC grading tools, such as the Kimura-Takemoto or Endoscopic Grading of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia classification, should be incorporated into the regular risk assessment protocol. However, obtaining mapping gastric biopsies using standardized methods such as the updated Sydney System biopsy protocol, followed by grading of chronic atrophic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia using the OLGA and OLGIM staging systems are preferred for GC risk stratification. Recent GC prevention strategies recommended in Chile include a \"test-and-treat\" approach for H. pylori in individuals aged 35-44 years and combined H. pylori/pepsinogen I-II serology and EGD evaluation in patients aged >45 years to optimize the limited preventive resources available in the region.",

In this study, we investigated the association between oral health and gastric cancer in Korean adults using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHODS: We analyzed data of 79501 patients with gastric cancer and 41856805 individuals without gastric cancer (control group) using the 7th and 8th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2019) records. Layer and colony variables and weights were used for the complex sample design. We performed logistic regression analysis of complex samples to analyze factors that affect gastric cancer development. RESULTS: Patients with gastric cancer were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes and a higher rate of current smoking and alcohol consumption than individuals without gastric cancer (p<0.001). Regarding oral health-related factors, the prevalence of very uncomfortable chewing difficulty was significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer (14.4% vs. 3.6%, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis of factors associated with gastric cancer, chewing difficulty showed the highest odds ratio (5.351, 95% confidence interval 2.128-8.982). Patients with very uncomfortable chewing difficulty had high rates of previous dental nerve treatment, gum disease treatment, tooth extraction or intraoral surgery, and prosthetic repair (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral health-related chewing difficulties were associated with gastric cancer, which may be attributable to poor oral hygiene and degradation of oral microbiota. Patients at risk of gastric cancer warrant timely medical interventions to address their oral health and chewing difficulties.",

However, as tumor development and progression are biological processes involving composite genomic aberrations, key challenges are to effectively assimilate information from these domains to identify genomic signatures and druggable biological entities, develop accurate risk prediction profiles for future patients, and identify novel patient subgroups for tailored therapy and monitoring. We propose integrative frameworks for high-dimensional multiple-domain cancer data. These Bayesian mixture model-based approaches coherently incorporate dependence within and between domains to accurately detect tumor subtypes, thus providing a catalog of genomic aberrations associated with cancer taxonomy. The flexible and scalable Bayesian nonparametric strategy performs simultaneous bidirectional clustering of the tumor samples and genomic probes to achieve dimension reduction. We describe an efficient variable selection procedure that can identify relevant genomic aberrations and potentially reveal underlying drivers of disease. Although the work is motivated by lung cancer datasets, the proposed methods are broadly applicable in a variety of contexts involving high-dimensional data. The success of the methodology is demonstrated using artificial data and lung cancer omics profiles publicly available from The Cancer Genome Atlas.",

To this end, we developed a quantile regression model for survival data in the presence of long-term survivors based on the generalized Gompertz distribution in a defective version, which is conveniently reparametrized in terms of the q-th quantile and then linked to covariates via a logarithm link function. This proposal allows us to obtain how each variable affects the survival times in different quantiles. In addition, we are able to study the effects of covariates on the cure rate as well.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), limited resources and inadequate healthcare infrastructures further exacerbate the challenges of breast cancer prevention, treatment, and awareness. METHODS: We examined the prevalence, risk factors, and trends of breast cancer in LMICs. Data on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and breast cancer risk factors were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) databases for 203 countries or territories from 1990 to 2019. LMIC DALY rates were examined using joinpoint regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the income groups, the lower middle-income category had the highest DALYs value, with 1787 years per 100,000 people. LMICs collectively accounted for 74% of the global burden of DALYs lost due to breast cancer in 2019. However, it remained relatively consistent in lower middle income countries (LMCs). In LMCs, the risk associated with metabolic syndromes was higher compared to that with behavioral factors alone. For the past three decades, breast cancer incidences increased significantly in LMCs (average annual percent change [AAPC]: 1.212, confidence intervals [CI]: 1.51-1.87, p < 0.001), upper middle income countries (AAPC: 1.701, CI: 1.12-1.48, p < 0.001), and low-income countries (AAPC: 1.002, CI: 1.57-1.68, p < 0.001).

As a result, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Patient Survey was established as the first standardized national survey to publicly report patient ratings on hospital care. There remains a lack of research that examines rural-urban distinctions in patient satisfaction. The objective of this study was to investigate if there is a difference in hospital determinants of patient satisfaction among hospitals based on rural status. METHODS: The study utilized two public datasets containing HCAHPS survey results from 4714 US hospitals and from eligible cancer hospitals that participate in the Prospective Payment System-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting. The data were collected from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 and published by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Rural status of each hospital was determined by matching zip codes with data provided by the Health Resources & Services Administration. RESULTS: A total of 3248 hospitals were included in the analysis, with approximately 51.14% located in rural areas. There was a significant difference across every hospital determinant when comparing rural and non-rural status. Rural hospitals had a higher score for every hospital determinant (Cleanliness, Nurse communication, Doctor communication, Staff responsiveness, Communication about medicines, Discharge information, Care transition, Overall hospital rating, Quietness, and Willingness to recommend the hospital), indicating better performance. CONCLUSION: Rural hospitals demonstrated better HCAHPS performance across every hospital determinant in comparison to urban hospitals, suggesting possible recent improvements.

With the availability of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screenings, it is more likely for cervical cancers to be prevented or caught early in their course. However, there are disparities and barriers preventing all individuals from obtaining proper preventative care. METHODS: An online survey analyzing compliance, barriers, and subjective perceptions of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening was distributed via flyers. These were placed in the half of zip codes with lowest median income in Fort Worth, Texas. RESULTS: Respondents with non-White race, income of $40,000 or less, and a maximum education of high school or less were 4.24, 3.2, and 1.2 times more likely to have incomplete HPV vaccination, respectively. Respondents with an income of $40,000 or less and a maximum education of high school were 3.2 and 2.6 times more likely to be overdue for cervical cancer screening, respectively. The most common barrier for HPV vaccination was lack of knowledge, and for cervical cancer screening, it was cost. Most respondents felt as though cervical cancer screening allows for early cancer detection and decreased mortality but also endorsed feelings of pain, embarrassment, and fear of the test. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine and cervical cancer screening non-compliance is likely multifactorial, including lack of knowledge and cost.

However, the links between in vitro and in vivo data are poorly understood, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of PROTACs. In this work, 14C-labeled vepdegestrant (ARV-471), which is currently in phase III clinical trials for breast cancer, was synthesized as a model PROTAC to characterize its preclinical ADME properties and simulate its clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) by establishing a physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model. For in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), hepatocyte clearance correlated more closely with in vivo rat PK data than liver microsomal clearance did. PBPK models, which were initially developed and validated in rats, accurately simulate ARV-471's PK across fed and fasted states, with parameters within 1.75-fold of the observed values. Human models, informed by in vitro ADME data, closely mirrored postoral dose plasma profiles at 30 mg. Furthermore, no human-specific metabolites were identified in vitro and the metabolic profile of rats could overlap that of humans.

Pancreatic cancers displayed the highest enrichment of hallmarks, emphasizing the disease's complexity, while in melanomas and cancers of the liver, prostate, and kidney, a single hallmark was enriched among the prognostic markers of survival. Additionally, an online tool (www.cancerhallmarks.com) that allows the identification of cancer-associated hallmarks from new gene sets was established. In summary, our aim of establishing a consensus list of cancer hallmark genes was achieved. Furthermore, the analysis of survival-associated genes revealed a unique pattern of hallmark enrichment with potential pharmacological implications in different tumor types.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Polyphyllin VII promotes hepatic stellate cell ferroptosis via the HIC1/CX3CL1/GPX4 axis.",
    "AbstractText": "Ferroptosis has been shown to mediate the development of fibrosis. Polyphyllin VII (PP7), a bioactive component of Paris polyphylla, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity and can significantly alleviate liver fibrosis. In this study, treatment with PP7 significantly inhibited the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which could be suppressed by a ferroptosis inhibitor. In addition, it promoted HSC ferroptosis by suppressing glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and enhanced the expression of CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1). Depletion of CX3CL1 attenuated the effects of PP7 on the activation and ferroptosis of HSCs and the expression of GPX4. Notably, CX3CL1 directly interacted with GPX4, triggering HSC ferroptosis. The transcription factor hypermethylated in cancer 1 (Hic1), which binds to the Cx3cl1 promoter, increased the expression of CX3CL1. Its absence resulted in downregulation of CX3CL1, suppressing the GPX4-dependent ferroptosis of PP7-treated HSCs and promoting their activation. HIC1 was found to directly interact with PP7 at the GLY164 site. Co-culture experiments showed that PP7-induced HSC ferroptosis attenuated macrophage recruitment by regulating inflammation-related genes. HSC-specific inhibition of HIC1 counteracted PP7-induced collagen depletion and HSC ferroptosis in vivo. These findings suggest that PP7 induces HSC ferroptosis through the HIC1/CX3CL1/GPX4 axis.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition is associated with postoperative complications and delayed recovery in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). This study investigated the effect of fiber-containing low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (low-FODMAP) formula on the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) complications with tube feeding after HNC surgery. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This retrospective study included 152 tube-fed patients who received nutritional support team care after undergoing surgery for HNC. The differences in nutritional status, nutrition supply, and length of hospital stay were compared according to tube feeding-associated GI complications. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated between Prognostic Nutritional Index, Nutritional Risk Index, a Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), and Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) as the reference standard. The correlation between changes in the fiber-containing low-FODMAP formula and diarrhea incidence during tube feeding was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 152 patients, 49.3% (n = 75) experienced GI complications during tube feeding. Patients with GI complications were hospitalized for approximately 10 days longer than those without complications. The prevalence rate of GLIM-defined malnutrition was 37.5% at admission. The percentage of patients at risk of developing malnutrition with NRS-2002 score ≥ 3 was 28.3% at admission. The area under the ROC curve of the NRS-2002 score for the GLIM diagnostic criteria for malnutrition was 0.908. The fiber-containing low-FODMAP formula change reduced the stool frequency in patients with diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Our study findings provide essential data for establishing guidelines for selecting suitable formulas for tube-fed patients who have previously experienced diarrhea after HNC surgery.",

    "ArticleTitle": "YAP, TAZ, and Hippo-Dysregulating Fusion Proteins in Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "Gene fusions are well-known drivers of cancer and are potent targets for molecular therapy. An emerging spectrum of human tumors harbors recurrent and pathognomonic gene fusions that involve the transcriptional coactivator YAP1 (which encodes the protein YAP) or its paralog WWTR1 (which encodes the protein TAZ). YAP and TAZ are frequently activated in cancer and are the transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway, a highly conserved kinase cascade that regulates diverse functions such as organ size, development, and homeostasis. In this review, we discuss the tumors that have YAP, TAZ, or other Hippo-dysregulating fusion proteins; the mechanisms of these fusion proteins in driving their respective tumors; and the potential vulnerabilities of these chimeric oncoproteins across cancers of many origins. Furthermore, as new YAP1 and WWTR1 gene fusions are discovered, we provide a framework to predict whether the resulting protein product is likely to be oncogenic.",

Most patients achieve complete symptom resolution without long-term neurological sequelae, yet the impact of ICANS and steroid therapy on oncological outcomes remains inadequately explored. We investigated the association between ICANS and steroid therapy with progression-free survival (PFS). METHODS: We included large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells. The primary outcome was 90-day PFS. The secondary outcomes included PFS, complete response, and overall survival (OS) at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days. The association between outcomes and ICANS and steroid treatment was assessed using logistic regression analyses adjusted for baseline factors. RESULTS: Overall, 241 patients were included. The median age was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 51-66), 81 (33.6%) were females, 67 (27.8%) developed ICANS, and 142 (58.9%) achieved 90-day PFS. There was no association between 90-day PFS and ICANS development (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.39 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 0.75-2.61]), maximum grade (aOR 1.24 [0.97-1.59]), duration (aOR 1.00 [95% CI = 0.95-1.05] per 1-day increase), or day of onset (aOR 0.98 [95% CI = 0.86-1.11] per 1-day increase). There was no association between 90-day PFS and steroid therapy (aOR 1.25 [95% CI = 0.73-2.14]) or cumulative dose (aOR 1.00 [95% CI = 0.98-1.01] per 100-mg increase). Similar results were observed for secondary outcomes, except for an association between ICANS and OS at 30 days (aOR 0.05 [95% CI = 0.01-0.54]) and 90 days (aOR 0.35 [95% CI = 0.15-0.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ICANS and steroid therapy do not adversely impact the PFS in lymphoma patients receiving anti-CD19 CAR T cells.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: This analysis aims to provide insight into differences in symptom burden and general health status between young adults (YA; 18-39 years old) and older adults (OA; ≥40 years old) with primary central nervous system tumors. METHODS: Data were retrospectively analyzed from the National Cancer Institute Neuro-Oncology Branch's Natural History Study (NCT02851706 PI: T.S. Armstrong) to determine differences in patient-reported outcomes (general health status [EQ-5D-3L], symptom burden [MDASI-BT and MDASI-SP], anxiety/depression [Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System], and perceived cognition [Neuro-QOL]) and demographic and clinical data using chi-square, one-way ANOVA, and Student's t-tests. Linear regression with backward elimination determined which characteristics impacted perceived symptom burden and general health status. RESULTS: The sample included 271 YA (82% with a primary brain tumor (PBT); median age 31 [range, 18-39]) and 516 OA (88% with a PBT; median age 54 [range, 40-85]). YA were more likely to be single (P < .001), employed (P < .001), and make < $50 000 per year (P = .014). More YA reported pain (P = .008), nausea (P < .001), drowsiness (P = .043), and vomiting (P = .001) than OA. Among demographic and clinical characteristics, when controlling for age, Karnofsky Performance Scale score (P < .001) and employment status (P < .001) were predictors of symptom interference, activity- and mood-related interference in patients with PBTs. Compared to OA with spinal tumors, YA reported more moderate-severe anxiety (P = .050) and moderate-severe perceived cognitive deficits (P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in characteristics and symptom burden exist between YA and OA. Developmentally tailored survivorship programs providing additional psychosocial support and resources to address symptom presentation in YA are needed.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Preventing Type I leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is critical when treating brain metastases (BMs). The aim of this study was to extract risk factors for Type I LM and to clarify the optimal treatment for BMs from the perspective of Type I LM prevention. METHODS: The clinical course of consecutive cases of BMs derived from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated at our hospital was retrospectively evaluated. The relationship between clinicopathological factors, including molecular background, and Type I LM development was verified. In addition, the difference in the time to Type I LM because of treatment for BMs was evaluated to clarify the effectiveness of each treatment in preventing Type I LM. RESULTS: Of 784 patients with BMs, 44 exhibited Type I LM at the onset of BMs. Poor performance status (P < .0001) and mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (P = .004) were significant risk factors for Type I LM. Among the 740 patients without LMC at diagnosis, 85 developed Type I LM. Younger age (P = .011) and mutated EGFR (P < .0001) were risk factors for developing LMC after BMs. Osimertinib reduced the incidence of Type I LM (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-0.97) in EGFR-mutated cases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) showed a tendency to prolong the time to Type I LM (HR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.02-1.11) in EGFR-wild-type cases. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC are prone to developing Type I LM. Osimertinib for EGFR-mutated cases and ICIs are expected to prevent Type I LM after the diagnosis of BMs.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Endosomal disruption by co-encapsulating gentamicin in lipid nanoparticles for efficient siRNA delivery and cancer therapy.",
    "AbstractText": "Efficient siRNA delivery is highly desirable for disease treatment. However, the application of conventional nanoparticles is limited by the inability to escape from endo-lysosomes. Herein, we report a strategy using small-molecule drugs to enhance siRNA endo-lysosomal release,addressing this challenge. We encapsulated gentamicin(GM) into the marketed Onpattro® formulation to establish LNP-siRNA/GM nanoparticles that promote siRNA endo-lysosomal escape through endosomal disruption, mechanistically exhibiting unique functionality and synergistic effects of LNP-siRNA/GM to improve cancer therapy. Besides, GM induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phospholipids accumulation in endo-lysosomes, as well as the physical characteristics of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were preserved. We also revealed that GM causes endo-lysosomal swelling and disrupts the endosomal membrane to enable siRNA release, as confirmed by Galectin 3 recruitment and acridine orange release. This approach achieved ∼81% mRNA-EGFR silencing, which is more than LNP-siEGFR (∼56.23%) by enhancing siRNA endo-lysosomal escape efficiency. Meanwhile, LNP-siEGFR/GM exhibited significant biological activities in HepG2 cells, driven by the synergistic effects of siEGFR and GM with the VEGF and CXCL12 downregulation of, and ROS and phospholipids upregulation. Furthermore, tumor growth was notably suppressed after intravenous injection of LNP-siEGFR/GM in tumor-bearing nude mice. The combination of EGFR-siRNA and GM could also greatly inhibit angiogenesis, be antiproliferative, and induce tumor cells apoptosis. Therefore, this GM and siRNA co-delivery system would provide an efficient strategy for siRNA endosomal escape, significantly improving knockdown in various LNPs based siRNA delivery systems and efficiently enhancing cancer therapy.",

    "AbstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows the highest morbidity among liver cancers and is a major contributor to cancer-associated mortality. It is characterized by genetic mutations in hepatocytes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Current treatment include surgery, chemotherapy and immunotherapy; however, chemotherapeutics, which focus on single-targeted drug therapy, are still associated with certain limitations and may affect the treatment outcomes. Compared with chemotherapy drugs, natural products also show the anticancer effect of HCC and hypotoxicity, but overall low activity of natural products limits their further application. MmiRNAs can modulate post-transcriptional functions of target genes. An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs are the key regulators in HCC by targeting different molecules in different signaling pathways. However, miRNAs are fragile and liable to catabolism by RNases in serum and other body fluids and small molecules separated from natural products may have limited bio-availability. According to this background, a chitosan based, targeted sustained-release nanoparticle delivery miR-128-3p agomir (NA-miR-128-3p) was developed in this work. This nanoparticle was prepared by pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), chitosan hydrochloride, and miR-128-3p agomir with target aptamer which was loaded into the chitosan nanoparticle by self-assembly. It can intervene in HCC progress by affecting AKT1 expression. Based on this, a novel, efficient, long-acting, multi-mechanism, low-dosage combination drug delivery strategy was proposed in this work and showed a prominent anti-tumor effect. NA-miR-128-3p combined with natural product Oroxin B significantly affected HCC progression by the interference with VEGF and PI3K-AKT pathways, better than using NA-miR-128-3p and Oroxin B alone. Taken together, this nanoparticle and combinative administration compensate for the shortcomings of the fragile RNA drugs and the low activity of natural products, with high prospects in HCC treatment.",

METHODS: A comprehensive review of recent studies investigating the role of platelets in immune modulation, specifically highlighting their involvement in pathogen recognition, leukocyte recruitment, and lymphocyte activation. Additionally, the review evaluates the impact of antiplatelet therapies, such as aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, on immune responses. RESULTS: Recent studies have emphasized the critical role of platelets in immune-driven applications, namely, atherosclerosis, cancer, viral infections, and sepsis. These studies also suggest that antiplatelet therapies may alter immune responses. However, the precise mechanisms through which platelets and antiplatelet drugs influence immune responses, as well as their effects on post-treatment and surgical outcomes, are not yet fully elucidated. CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies highlight the important role of platelets in immune processes, such as in atherosclerosis, cancer, viral infections, and sepsis, and suggest that antiplatelet therapies can influence immune responses. However, the exact mechanisms by which platelets and antiplatelet drugs modulate these responses remain unclear. This area presents valuable opportunities for future research to uncover these mechanisms, which could lead to novel therapeutic strategies and better clinical outcomes for patients.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: There is a growing body of evidence that ultraviolet (UV) tanning, whether practiced in indoor tanning salons or outdoors in the sun, is not only linked to detrimental health outcomes but is also addictive through both psychological and physiological mechanisms. In clinical practice, it can be challenging to determine which patients will continue tanning despite being at high risk for developing skin cancer. Our study seeks to identify all available screening questionnaires for tanning addiction that could be used in clinical practice and report on published measures of validity for each screening questionnaire. METHODS: An exhaustive literature search of EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus was performed using search criteria including the concepts \"UV\" and \"Addiction.\" The most recent search was performed in March 2024 and included all articles from database inception to the time of the search. Studies were included if they reported on screening questionnaires for UV addiction. Articles were excluded from the study if they did not report primary data or did not report on measures of questionnaire validity. Methodology was created using best practices for scoping reviews. RESULTS: After identifying 171 articles, 106 articles underwent full-text review, and 26 were included in data extraction. We identified nine questionnaires for tanning addiction, with the modified Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (mCAGE), and modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (mDSM) being most frequently reported on, and the Behavioral Addiction Indoor Tanning Screener (BAITS) being the most promising for future use. CONCLUSIONS: This information should be used to choose questionnaires to be studied against a \"gold-standard\" of a panel of psychologists. After defining accuracy of diagnostic tests, studies can be designed to examine interventions for treating tanning addiction, so at-risk patients can receive specialized therapy, reducing the overall burden of skin cancers.",

    "AbstractText": "Diagnosis with cancer can be a shocking, life-altering, and traumatic experience for both the affected patient and their family, which may include immediate or extended family, significant others, and caregivers. Living with or surviving cancer can negatively impact the patient and their family members individually, and it can also result in negative effects on the patient-family dyad. In the US alone, the American Cancer Society anticipates approximately 2 million new cases of cancer in 2024; moreover, as many as 25% to 30% of cancer survivors experience anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Although healthcare providers are often pressed for time during routine initial and follow-up appointments, exploration of the person with cancer's journey through the disease course must be a priority and a collaborative effort. Prompt identification of mental health disorders, including substance use disorders, in people with cancer and their family members is essential to the well-being of the dyad. Many primary care providers provide both primary care services and survivorship care, such as posttreatment preexisting and secondary cancer surveillance, to cancer survivors. Primary care NPs are therefore well positioned to screen, assess, and treat mental health conditions in the cancer survivor and their family. The primary care NP also may have a greater opportunity to interface with patients' family members, thereby promoting healthier families and societies.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to preventive healthcare. India's vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. RESULTS: The study found that employment status significantly influenced healthcare costs, with employed women incurring ₹65.78 more than unemployed women (p < 0.001). Education level was also a significant predictor, with each additional year of education leading to a ₹108.45 increase in costs (p < 0.001). Travel time had a positive association with healthcare costs, with every additional minute spent traveling increasing costs by ₹5.98 (p < 0.001). Income and companion accompaniment were also significant predictors, while distance to the PHC and age did not show significant associations with total healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the multifaceted economic challenges faced by rural populations accessing HPV screening for cervical cancer prevention in India. Notwithstanding diverse demographics and varying proximity to healthcare facilities, individuals encounter significant barriers such as travel time and associated costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities and improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations, thereby advancing cervical cancer prevention efforts and promoting health equity in rural communities.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 2-[18F]FDG (FDG) has been increasingly used to detect or monitor neoplasms. Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is one of the most common sites of FDG uptake, leading to increasing requests for endoscopic examinations. We aimed to evaluate the nature and significance of unexpected PET/CT-FDG findings in the GIT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 371 consecutive patients with incidental GIT findings on PET/CT-FDG between June 2016 and October 2021 who were subsequently referred to endoscopic examinations. Demographic data, PET/CT-FDG results, endoscopic findings, and histological analysis were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 194 colonic incidental uptakes, 102 (52.6%) corresponded to at least premalignant lesions, being 57 (29.4%) advanced adenomas and 23 (11.9%) adenocarcinomas. Of 193 upper GIT incidental uptakes, there were 11 (13.8%) esophageal and 14 (14.4%) gastric malignant/premalignant lesions. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) significantly varied according to the nature of the lesion, being higher in malignant lesions (in the esophagus, stomach, and colon). However, an optimal SUVmax cutoff was only found for stomach (SUVmax 8.2; sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 76%). There was a significant association between the site of uptake and the nature of the lesion - left colon and gastric body uptake were associated with neoplastic origin whereas rectum and lower esophagus were associated with inflammatory or no endoscopic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Any incidental uptake in the lower GIT should be investigated provided that patients are suitable for further treatment. However, in the upper GIT the characteristics of uptake on 18F-FDG-PET/CT may allow to select those who need endoscopic examination.",

We calculated the rates of common health conditions and explored differences between White European and South Asian participants. METHODS: 21 health conditions were identified using diagnostic codes and prescription records extracted from electronic health records. We calculated 2-year period prevalence before recruitment and incidence rates per 1000 person-years were calculated from recruitment to the end of 2021 (or censoring). Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HR) by ethnicity. RESULTS: The sample included 9,784 mothers, 52% were of South Asian heritage and 48% were White European. The highest prevalence and incidence rates were observed for common mental health disorders and eczema. South Asian women had higher incidence of 14 conditions, including diabetes (HR 3.94 [95% CI 3.15, 4.94]), chronic liver disease (2.98 [2.29, 3.88]) and thyroid disorders (1.87 [1.50, 2.33]), but lower incidence of cancer (0.51 [0.38, 0.68]), other and common mental health disorders (0.56 [0.45, 0.71] and 0.69 [0.64, 0.74] respectively), and other neuromuscular conditions (0.63 [0.49, 0.82]). CONCLUSIONS/DISCUSSION: This study reveals significant differences in the occurrence of several non-communicable health conditions between White European and South Asian women. The observed higher incidence of several conditions in South Asian women, consistent with established knowledge regarding elevated risks for diseases such as diabetes, likely reflects the complex interplay of social, cultural, lifestyle, environmental, and genetic determinants. These findings emphasise the need for culturally sensitive and targeted public health interventions aimed at addressing modifiable risk factors at both the individual and systemic levels to alleviate the burden of long-term health conditions and reduce existing health inequalities.",

DESIGN: Secondary data were used in a retrospective, observational study. SETTING: The setting was a National Cancer Institute (NCI) hospital in Richmond, Virginia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-93 years of age (51.6% female and 48.4% identifying as male) with 6 cancer diagnoses (breast, blood/hematologic, colorectal/gastrointestinal, gynecologic, lung/respiratory, and prostate/genitourinary) admitted to an NCI over 5 years were included for analysis. There were 1949 patients included for analysis in a paired t test, and 448 patients analyzed in an adjusted linear regression based upon complete case analysis. INTERVENTION: The study analyzed the receipt and intensity of OT services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) 6-Clicks Basic Mobility scores were analyzed at the time of admission to therapy services and prior to discharge. RESULTS: The patients' final recorded AM-PAC 6-Clicks Basic Mobility score was statistically significantly higher than the first session's AM-PAC 6-Clicks Basic Mobility score as determined by a paired t test analysis. In a multiple linear regression model adjusted for patient social and demographic factors, we found that for every additional OT service provided, there was an increase in the AM-PAC 6-Clicks Basic Mobility change score; the difference, however, was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant increase in functional mobility independence for patients with cancer who received OT services in an unadjusted analysis and a non-significant increase in an adjusted analysis of patients' functional mobility. Findings suggest OT services for patients with cancer may influence functional mobility independence.",

We hypothesized that a combination of palliative care via video telemedicine (TMD) and usual outpatient treatment would improve patients' quality of life (QOL) and ameliorate depression and prognosis. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer who terminated treatment with chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients who could perform videoconferencing were assigned to the TMD group and those who could not perform were assigned to the (no TMD; control) group. The primary endpoint was QOL, which was evaluated using the difference in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scores between baseline and one-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints included depression, measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, overall survival, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included in this study (25 in each group). A comparison of measures of QOL at one month showed that the TMD group maintained a better QOL. FACT-G decreased by 0.21 and 5.96 points in the TMD and no TMD groups, respectively (p = 0.047). The TMD group maintained better QOL. There were trends suggesting improvements in depression and survival which did not reach significance. CES-D increased by 0.92 and 3.50 points in the TMD and no TMD groups, respectively (p = 0.26). Median survival time was 7.82 (3.30-14.59) and 6.37 (2.33-11.04) months in the TMD and no TMD groups, respectively. The results of the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire suggest that video TMD could be a feasible tool in palliative care. CONCLUSION: Video TMD is effective in maintaining the QOL of patients with advanced cancer and is feasible based on patient satisfaction. It is desirable to further evaluate the usefulness of palliative care using video TMD and evaluate its clinical applications.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Should Radiation Dose Be Personalized in Patients With Localized NSCLC and Actionable Genetic Alterations? Insight From a Multicenter Real-World Study.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT) is central to the management of unresectable stage I to III NSCLC. However, the impact of actionable genetic driver alterations (AGAs) on locoregional control (LRC) from RT remains uncertain. A retrospective, multicenter real-world study was undertaken to determine if common AGAs impact LRC after RT. METHODS: Patients who received curative-intent RT for NSCLC between 2018 and 2020 at four centers in the United Kingdom and had available molecular testing were included. Locoregional control was compared in a 1:2 ratio between a group of patients with an AGA and a control group without AGAs. Locoregional control was assessed with competing risks analysis and overall survival was analyzed by Cox regression, adjusting for established prognostic clinical factors. RESULTS: Data was collected for 185 eligible patients: 50 with an AGA and 135 without. Baseline characteristics, including patient demographics, tumor features, and treatment details were evenly distributed between the two groups. LRC was similar in the AGA and non-AGA groups (39% versus 34%, hazard ratio = 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.984, p = 0.84). Actionable genetic driver alterations were not associated with LRC according to multivariable regression analysis. Median overall survival was significantly higher in the AGA group (45 mo versus 26 mo, hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.96, p = 0.044), and all these patients received targeted therapies on relapse. CONCLUSION: LRC was comparable in the AGA and non-AGA groups suggesting that there is no role for personalization of RT dose solely due to the detection of an AGA. Nevertheless, survival rates were notably higher among patients with AGAs, likely owing to the availability of efficacious targeted therapies on relapse.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer (BCa) is a prevalent malignant tumor in the urinary system. Molecular subtyping, utilizing molecular characteristics, represents a novel classification system that has demonstrated its efficacy in tumor diagnosis and treatment. Given the critical role of molecular subtyping in the BCa treatment, acquiring a comprehensive understanding is imperative for guiding treatment decisions, optimizing risk assessment systems, and ultimately improving patient prognosis. METHODS: In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the research progress in molecular subtyping of BCa, with a primary focus on discussing its utility in guiding various treatment modalities including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. In addition, this review also covers the trimodality treatment, antibody-drug conjugates, and the treatment of small cell BCa. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive overview of the responsiveness or resistance of different molecular subtypes of BCa to various therapeutic modalities. The basal subtype demonstrates favorable sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy across multiple classification systems, whereas the luminal infiltrated subtype exhibits potential susceptibility to immunotherapy. In terms of targeted therapy, the basal-like and the basal/squamous subtypes in some classifications have shown notable responsiveness to epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy. Moreover, the luminal subtype in the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center classification, the luminal papillary subtypes according to the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network classification in 2017, and the luminal unstable type in the 2019 Molecular Subtyping classification show potential for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3-targeted treatment. CONCLUSION: The significance and impact of BCa molecular subtyping in guiding treatment, evaluating progression, and predicting prognosis are increasingly acknowledged. Accurate subtyping and broad application can bring good benefits to clinical decision-making, risk assessment, and prognostic evaluation.",

    "AbstractText": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process that involves the transformation of epithelial cells into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype, enhancing their migratory and invasive capabilities. EMT is crucial in embryonic development, tissue healing, and wound repair, and aids in forming diverse cell types and structures. However, aberrant EMT is involved in pathogenic processes, including fibrosis, cancer development, and progression. Recent studies show that EMT contributes to resistance to cancer treatment, including epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This review discusses the intricate relationship between EMT and acquired chemoresistance to EGFR-TKIs. It details evidence on how EGFR-TKIs might induce EMT and how EMT may cause EGFR-TKI resistance. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing effective prognostic and therapeutic strategies to predict and combat acquired chemoresistance in NSCLC, advancing the field toward more targeted and personalized treatment approaches.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Tryptophan metabolism is involved in esophageal carcinogenesis. However, its genetic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic variants that encode tryptophan metabolism on susceptibility to esophageal cancer (EC) and elucidate the mechanisms underlying genetic variation in EC progression. METHODS: Age- and sex-matched cohorts of 167 patients with EC and 236 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolites were determined by self-assembled high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. High-throughput sequencing techniques were utilized to detect candidate coding genetic variants, and dominant genetic models were used to elucidate the genotypic associations. RESULTS: Tryptophan metabolism was significantly imbalanced in patients with EC, with elevated indolepropionic acid (IPA) levels reducing the risk of EC susceptibility. ACSM2B rs73530508 (A > G) mutation was associated with higher IPA levels in vivo (P = 0.0004, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.0092) and significantly reduced the risk of EC susceptibility (odds ratio [OR]: 0.576, P adj = 0.0161). Mediation effect analysis indicated that single-nucleotide polymorphism may inhibit carcinogenesis by reducing IPA metabolism and excretion with a mediation effect of 45.54%. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the potential mechanism of ACSM2B rs73530508 (A > G) in esophageal carcinogenesis and its role in driving increased IPA levels, thereby suppressing the risk of development.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignancy characterized by the absence of reliable prognostic indicators and effective therapeutic targets. Claudin-9 (CLDN9) has been demonstrated to be upregulated in various cancers. However, its prognostic value, biological function, and regulatory mechanisms in GC remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the role of CLDN9 in GC progression and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We utilized consensus cluster, random survival forest, and multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify CLDN9 in GC. Subsequently, we evaluated the mRNA and protein levels of CLDN9 in GC using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR), Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the role of CLDN9 in GC progression was investigated using a series of functional in vivo and in vitro experiments. Finally, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CLDN9 using bioinformatics, molecular biology, animal models, and patient tissue specimens. RESULTS: Two GC subtypes with survival and functional differences were identified based on glycolytic metabolic genes in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)- Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) dataset. A prognostic risk score was calculated using seven genes to assess the overall survival (OS) in GC. Using random survival forest and multivariate Cox analyses, we identified CLDN9 as the key gene linked to the glycolytic subtype and prognosis of GC. CLDN9 expression was significantly upregulated in patients with GC as well as in GC cells. CLDN9 knockdown inhibited tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CLDN9 was found to regulate lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression and promote glycolytic metabolism by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) signaling pathway. Additionally, lactate, a glycolytic metabolite, enhanced programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) lactylation and stability, which suppressed anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells, thereby contributing to GC progression. CONCLUSIONS: CLDN9 expression is associated with GC development and progression. Mechanistically, CLDN9 enhances the glycolysis pathway and facilitates PD-L1 lactylation through the PI3K/AKT/HIF1α signaling pathway, thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells. CLDN9 has the potential to serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for GC.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Targeting cuproptosis for cancer therapy: Focus on the anti-tumor immune system.",
    "AbstractText": "Copper (Cu) is an indispensable micronutrient that maintains signaling pathways and biological homeostasis in almost all cell types; however, its excess affects the tricarboxylic acid cycle, causes the accumulation of fatty acylated proteins, destabilization of iron-sulfur cluster proteins, and increases the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, leading to proteotoxic stress and cell death. Cuproptosis, a form of Cu-dependent cell death, differs from other types of regulated cell death (RCD) and was first reported in Science in 2022. Recently, the RCD pathways have been targeted in cancer therapy. However, the escape of apoptosis in tumor cells causes resistance to treatment and tumor recurrence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the alternative mechanisms of cancer cell mortality. Compared to normal patients, a significant increase in serum Cu ion levels has been observed in patients with tumors. Moreover, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis are associated with cuproptosis. Thus, exploring cancer signaling pathways related to cuproptosis will provide a new perspective for the development of anti-cancer drugs. Importantly, cuproptosis is closely associated with the modulation of anti-tumor immunity. The expression of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) is significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration and the immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Based on these findings, a series of cuproptosis-related drugs have been used in tumor-targeted combination therapy or as immune synergists. Therefore, elucidating the role of cuproptosis per cancer stage and in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is helpful in clarifying the potential value of Cu in the treatment of specific cancers. In this review, we summarize specific cancer signaling pathways related to cuproptosis and cancer treatment based on the regulation of Cu concentration. The combination of these two approaches may help researchers develop more therapies targeting cuproptosis-related pathways. Importantly, we focused on the effect of cuproptosis on the TIME and systematically discussed the role of CRGs in tumor immunity considering CRG-related anti-tumor immune signaling pathways, tumor prognosis scoring system, anti-tumor immunotherapy, and biological experiments and bioinformatics prediction models, to provide new ideas for the development of anticancer therapy targeting cuproptosis-related pathways.",

    "AbstractText": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal disease with increasing incidences worldwide. The overall 5-year survival rate remains low, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapies. Despite the promising efficacy of immunotherapy for various solid tumors, its benefits for pancreatic cancer have been disappointing. This is largely because of the complex and unique mechanisms of immune evasion inherent in PDAC. Emerging evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating the immune escape of PDAC. TAMs significantly contribute to forming an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which hinders the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic approaches. They achieve this through multiple pathways, including the secretion of cytokines and the promotion or inhibition of multiple immune cells. In this review, we summarized the main pathways through which TAMs form an immunosuppressive microenvironment in PDAC. We also examined the current status and recent progress of immunotherapy strategies that specifically target macrophages. By understanding these mechanisms and exploring targeted therapies, we aimed to shed light on potential avenues for improving the treatment outcomes of this devastating disease.",

For many years, traditional approaches such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation, and surgical interventions have been employed to treat BC. However, these therapies often fall short due to considerable adverse effects and the development of multidrug resistance or tolerance. Spices and culinary herbs that have been utilized in culinary practices for millennia have also demonstrated therapeutic effects in traditional medicinal practices serving to both prevent and treat BC. This review aims to comprehensively explore the roles and underlying mechanisms through which spices and culinary herbs exert anti-BC properties. These natural ingredients exhibit diverse anti-BC effects that encompass diverse mechanisms, including the inhibition of BC cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis, as well as the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These actions are achieved by targeting signaling pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), notch signaling, Hedgehog signaling, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and Wingless/int (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling pathways that are predominantly overexpressed in breast tumors or are exploited by them to promote cancer progression. Additionally, compounds such as curcumin, allicin, gingerol, zerumbone, diosgenin, capsaicin, piperine, quercetin, malabaricone C, eugenol, cardamomin, carnosol, cinnamaldehyde, sinigrin present in these spices and herbs may be more effective with reduced side effects against BC compared to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.

Objective This study is to compare the ultrasound with computed tomography in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Method This was an observational prospective study conducted from October 2020 to April 2023 in patients with or suspected lung cancer sent for imaging assessment to the Department of Radiology and Imaging. Out of 306 patients who underwent computed tomography scan, a total of 234 patients with proven lung cancer were subjected to ultrasound of the chest, liver, bilateral adrenal, and supraclavicular regions for the evaluation of lung mass, pleural effusion, and metastasis in lung, adrenal, and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Diagnostic values of ultrasound to detect peripheral lung lesions, chest wall invasion, pleural effusion, liver and adrenal metastasis, and supraclavicular lymph nodes were compared with contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans. Ultrasound's performance was evaluated against computed tomography scans as the gold standard, using the chi-square test, z-test, and area under the curve for comparison (p < 0.05 for significance). Result The majority of patients (53.8%, n=126) were aged 61-75, with 53% being male and 89% smokers. Ultrasound was superior in detecting pleural effusion (sensitivity 80.3%, NPV 92.2%, AUC 0.860) and supraclavicular lymph nodes (sensitivity 72.2%, NPV 91.6%, AUC 0.817). Conclusion In resource-constrained settings like Nepal, where advanced imaging may be limited, integrating ultrasound with contrast-enhanced computed tomography significantly improves lung cancer diagnosis.

Overall, patients with TRG1 show good sensitivity to NCRT but the long-term survival for these patients remains different. This study aimed to assess the prognostic factors in patients with TRG1. METHODS: LARC patients who underwent NCRT and radical surgery were included. TRG was evaluated according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The association between clinicopathological factors and survival outcomes was assessed in patients with TRG1. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated using both Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of the 393 LARC patients, 104 (26.5%) were diagnosed with TRG1. The 5-year OS rates and 5-year DFS rates of patients with TRG1 were 90.9% and 72.2%, respectively. In patients with TRG1, the tumor regression pattern (P = 0.001), pathologic tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P = 0.002), neoadjuvant rectal score (P = 0.024), T downstaging (P = 0.022), and baseline carcinoembryonic antigen level (P = 0.038) were associated with DFS in univariate analysis. Only the tumor regression pattern showed prognostic significance for DFS in multivariate analysis (P = 0.003). The group with tumor shrinkage had a higher OS rate than the tumor fragmentation group but the difference in the OS rates between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.196). CONCLUSIONS: TRG could be a prognostic variable for LARC patients receiving NCRT. In patients with TRG1, the tumor regression pattern may represent another useful prognostic factor to better individualize the prognosis.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Artificial Intelligence and Radiomics Applied to Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Imaging: A Review.",
    "AbstractText": "The skeletal system is the most common site of metastatic prostate cancer, and these lesions are associated with poor outcomes. Diagnosing these osseous metastatic lesions relies on radiologic imaging, making early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring crucial for clinical management. However, the literature lacks a detailed analysis of various approaches and future directions. To address this gap, we present a scoping review of quantitative methods from diverse domains, including radiomics, machine learning, and deep learning, applied to imaging analysis of prostate cancer with clinical insights. Our findings highlight the need for developing clinically significant methods to aid in the battle against prostate bone metastasis.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Risk of breast cancer in assisted reproduction technology: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Presently, there is a growing popularity of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Nevertheless, due to the significant fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels observed in patients receiving this novel technology, concerns have been raised regarding the potential increased risk of breast cancer associated with this treatment. The outcomes of pertinent clinical investigations exhibit significant disparities, leading to a lack of consensus regarding the association between ART and susceptibility to breast cancer. The primary objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the impact of ART on the risk of breast cancer. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and Meta-analysis Guidelines for Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Researchers conducted an extensive electronic search across databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, encompassing all articles published over the last two decades (from January 2003 to December 2023). Two independent researchers meticulously examined the titles and abstracts of the literature based on predetermined inclusion criteria and research qualifications. Through collaborative deliberation, they identified the literature to be incorporated in the following analysis. Researchers will extract data in accordance with predetermined tables and perform quality assessments and implement bias control measures for each literature. Researchers will conduct a meta-analysis based on the extracted data to assess the overall risk and subgroup risks. The analysis will employ the odds ratio as the summary statistic and will use fixed or random effects models for estimation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings of this systematic review will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at international medical conferences, with the aim of reaching both medical professionals and the general public. As this study constitutes a systematic review, ethical approval is not required.",

    "AbstractText": "Bendamustine is among the most commonly used chemoimmunotherapies for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). It is typically delivered with a goal regimen consisting of 6 cycles, but it is possible that treatment goals could be achieved with fewer cycles, particularly in older patients. We used data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) linkage between Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and Medicare claims to evaluate the overall survival of patients with FL receiving 3 to 4 vs 5 to 6 cycles of bendamustine. Patients receiving 1 to 2 cycles of bendamustine chemotherapy were not included. Patients receiving 5 to 6 cycles of bendamustine were significantly younger (mean age, 75.0 vs 76.2 years; P < .01) and had fewer comorbidities by the NCI comorbidity index (mean score, 1.7 vs 2.0; P = .05) than those receiving 3 to 4 cycles of bendamustine, and on univariate analysis exhibited significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.98; P = .04). However, multivariate analysis controlling for age and comorbidity did not reveal a significant association between overall survival and number of cycles of bendamustine (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66-1.15; P = .33). Limitations inherent to use of data such as these for causal inference are acknowledged. Nonetheless, these analyses suggest some older patients with FL achieve satisfactory survival outcomes even with lesser bendamustine exposure, and future efforts to prospectively identify such patients are warranted.",

The median age was 53 years, 75% were uninsured, and 81% were in the most disadvantaged Area Deprivation Index national quartiles. Most (69%) had stage III/IV disease, 44% had poor-risk disease by the Revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI), and 17% had a history of HIV infection. The median diagnosis-to-treatment interval was 17 days. The median follow-up time was 53.5 months. Among 464 evaluable patients, 66% achieved a complete response, and 11% had a partial response. Of 48 patients, 26 (54%) eligible for cell therapies received them. At 5 years, event-free and overall survival (OS) rates were 57% and 68%, respectively.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer survivors and care partners navigated social interactions amidst the uncertainties of cancer-related vulnerability and risk. Vaccination offered a new tool for self-management yet created potential for conflict within survivors' and care partners' social networks. OBJECTIVE: We examined cancer survivors' and care partners' perceptions of the impact of vaccine availability on social interactions. METHODS: In May 2021, survivor and care partner participants in a prospective study of social support network interactions (N=64) were invited to complete an online survey about COVID-19 vaccination and record an audio diary describing the impact of vaccine availability. Descriptive statistics summarized demographic data. Audio diaries were transcribed, inductively coded, and themes developed and narratively summarized. RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants (42.9%) completed the survey and n=21 (33.3%; n=8 caregivers, 38.1%, n=13 survivors, 61.9%) recorded diaries. Eighty percent (n=21) of the sample received the COVID-19 vaccine. Two themes illustrated the impact of COVID-19 vaccines within a cancer context: Providing hope and Reconnecting with life. CONCLUSION: Vaccination decisions allowed many cancer survivors and partners to reengage with their social networks. With limited guidance, many relied on their own knowledge, values, and experiences to determine how to preserve their health. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Utilizing a shared decision-making model, nurses can help families develop strategies that enact their values to promote long-term health. Nursing education and support can be further strengthened to create patient self-efficacy when navigating social interactions in the post-COVID era.

    "AbstractText": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs), harboring stem cell-like properties involving self-renewal and aberrant differentiation potential, have been known to be one of the determining factors that contribute to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. However, much remains to be understood about the reprogramming network leading to the generation of CSCs driven by chemotherapy. In this study, guided by bioinformatics study, we uncover and provide deeper insight into the CSC enrichment mechanism driven by cisplatin (CDDP) treatment. We discover that CDDP can repopulate the level of CSC by activating AKT1 oncogenic pathway that is further enhanced by COX-2 inflammatory signaling. Simultaneously blocking these two pathways can synergistically restrain the number of CSCs. Under the guidance of a series of advanced hierarchical computational modeling, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding free energy analysis, MK-2206 is selected as the AKT1 inhibitor to achieve optimal codelivery of CDDP, MK-2206 and 5-ASA (COX-2 inhibitor) through the use of 5-ASA-derivatized dual functional immunostimulatory nanocarrier (PASA). This triple combination (PASA/CDDP/MK-2206) significantly reduces tumor burden in both orthotopic and metastatic lung cancer models. Mechanistic studies show that this improved therapeutic activity is due to elimination of CSCs and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Our study suggests that PASA/CDDP/MK-2206 may represent a simple and effective lung cancer therapy via reversing CSCs-associated chemoresistance.",

    "AbstractText": "Advancements in mRNA-based therapeutics have greatly enhanced cancer immunotherapy by using the immune system to specifically target and eradicate cancer cells. There has been notable advancement in tailoring and administering mRNA to treat cancer. Codon optimization, chemical alterations, and sequence manipulation are complex design methodologies employed in the production of mRNA vaccines and treatments. The goal is to improve the ability of the chemicals to stimulate an immune response, increase their ability to be translated into practical applications, and boost their stability. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most efficient means of delivering mRNA because they can withstand degradation, enhance cellular uptake, and facilitate endosomal escape. Scientists are currently investigating the possibility of using alternate methods of delivering substances, including as exosomes, lipoplexes, and polymeric nanoparticles, to enhance the ability to target specific tissues and minimize unwanted negative consequences. In addition, recent clinical trials and preclinical investigations have demonstrated encouraging findings in terms of the advancement of strong anti-tumor immune responses, long-lasting tumor shrinkage, and enhanced patient outcomes. The remaining challenges involve optimizing the equilibrium between tolerance and immunological activation, addressing systemic toxicity, and expanding manufacturing techniques. The upcoming study seeks to improve the design and dissemination of mRNA, include it in combination drugs, and investigate its therapeutic uses outside cancer. The advancement in cancer treatment represents a change in the current approach, highlighting the significant impact of mRNA technology in revolutionizing immunotherapy and enabling tailored cancer treatments.",

Nucleic acid therapy has advanced significantly in the interim. The diverse capabilities of nucleic acid therapies, gene-editing guide RNA (gRNA), immunomodulatory DNA/RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA and siRNA, plasmids, and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), for modification of immune responses and change the target endogenous or synthetic gene's expression, make them appealing. These skills can be extremely important in the creation of innovative immunotherapy approaches. To be effective, these treatments must, however, overcome a number of delivery challenges, such as quick in vivo disintegration, inadequate absorption inside target cells, necessary nuclear entrance, along with possible in-vivo toxic potential in tissues and cells that are healthy. Several of these obstacles have been addressed by the development of nanoparticle delivery methods, which allow nucleic acid therapies to be safely and successfully delivered to immune cells. The nucleic acid applications for medicines employed for immunotherapy against cancer are covered in this chapter, along with the development of nanoparticle platforms that carry genome editing, mRNA, and DNA systems for improving the efficacy and safety profile in various therapies.",

    "AbstractText": "mRNA carries genetic information and is used for the synthesis of proteins, fragments of proteins, and peptides in the scope of biotechnology and medicine. Once introduced into cells, this mRNA gets translated into a corresponding protein with cellular machinery. All kinds of mRNA encoding any protein, peptide, and fragment of proteins have been designed to be used for various therapeutic goals, including cancerous diseases, immunotherapy, vaccine preparation, tissue engineering, and genetic disorders, among others. These vaccines encode tumor-specific antigens that stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Additionally, mRNA can be designed to produce proteins that modulate immune checkpoints, thereby enhancing the immune system's ability to target cancer cells. Synthetic mRNA can also engineer immune cells, such as T cells, to improve their cancer-fighting capabilities. For instance, mRNA can be engineered to generate CAR T cells targeting specific antigens that are expressed in the cancer. Designed mRNA can encode functional proteins in patients suffering from genetic disorders characterized by an absence or defect in a particular protein. However, mRNA is intrinsically unstable and may require special mechanisms to protect it from degradation. mRNA delivery to target cells remains a challenge. Engineered nanocarriers containing mRNA can improve the efficiency and enable the delivery to specific sites, that can provide a stimulant or substance for therapeutic purposes. This combination may improve their stability and efficacy in multiple applications of therapies. The following chapter throws light on basic advances in mRNA-based cancer therapy and provides insights into the nanotherapeutics using mRNA in key preclinical developments and the evolving clinical landscape.",

With the rising incidence of melanoma diagnoses, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments. Among the most modern approaches are cancer vaccines, which aim to enhance cell-mediated immunity. Recently, mRNA-based cancer vaccines have gained significant attention due to their rapid production, low manufacturing costs, and ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. These vaccines hold great potential in melanoma treatment, yet their application faces several challenges, including mRNA stabilization, delivery methods, and tumor heterogeneity. The recent success of mRNA vaccines in combating COVID-19 has renewed interest in their potential for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, mRNA cancer vaccines offer high specificity and better efficacy compared to traditional treatments. They can target tumor-specific neoantigens, prompting a robust immune response. This chapter reviews the mechanism of action of mRNA vaccines, advancements in adjuvant identification, and innovations in delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles. It also discusses ongoing clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines in melanoma, highlighting promising early-phase results. Despite their potential, the development of mRNA cancer vaccines faces significant obstacles. Tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and practical issues like vaccine administration and clinical evaluation methods are major barriers to success. By addressing these challenges and advancing innovations, mRNA cancer vaccines hold promise for transforming melanoma treatment. A careful balance between the opportunities and challenges will be key to unlocking the full potential of mRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy.",

Despite these advances, there has been limited development of strategies to counter the unwanted and debilitating effects associated with cancer and its treatments. Indeed, syndromes including cachexia, cardiotoxicity, fatigue, and mucositis among others plague cancer survivors, leading to poor life quality and premature mortality. The systemic nature of these impairments creates a strong rationale for treatment strategies to mitigate syndromes affecting cancer survivors. Currently, however, there are limited treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to counter the debilitating side effects of cancer and cancer treatments. In noncancer clinical populations, physical activity is a well-established strategy to increase muscle mass, improve cardiovascular health, enhance energy levels, and promote gut health. Although physical activity programs are widely encouraged for cancer survivors, researchers are just beginning to understand the physiological basis of their positive effects and how they can be maximized for different cancer populations and treatments.

    "AbstractText": "Conventional inhibitors of immune checkpoints such as anti-programmed death-1 and its ligand (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4) have revolutionized therapeutic approaches to cancer, establishing immunotherapy as the standard of care for many cancers. A significant number of cancers, however, remain refractory to the inhibition of these immune checkpoints, leading to the search for alternative immune checkpoints that are more relevant to those diseases. Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated efferocytosis is an increasingly appreciated immune checkpoint with a profound impact on the phenotype of the tumor microenvironment (TME). TAMs perform their efferocytic function through the receptor MerTK, and MerTK activity correlates with tumor progression. To combat efferocytosis in the TME, we developed poly[[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-b-poly(methacrylamidomannose)] nanoparticles (PMAM NPs) capable of encapsulating and preferentially delivering UNC2025 (a MerTK inhibitor) to TAMs. The NPs had suitable physicochemical properties, such as a size of 130 nm and a neutral surface charge. The PMAM NPs encapsulated hydrophobic cargo and released them in a pH-dependent manner, showing suitability for cytosolic delivery. Moreover, the PMAM NPs showed 12-fold greater macrophage internalization than traditional PEGMA NPs. Macrophage internalization was shown to be dependent on the mannose receptor CD206, as the blockade of CD206 led to a significant decrease in PMAM NP internalization. Furthermore, PMAM NPs had a lower internalization than PEGMA NPs in 4T1 cancer cells that do not express CD206, further confirming macrophage selectivity. In vivo biodistribution studies showed the PMAM NPs were capable of internalization by TAMs in the TME. Lastly, UNC2025-PMAM NPs significantly reduced tumor volume compared to free UNC2025, showing greater therapeutic efficacy in a model of triple-negative breast cancer. These glycopolymer-based, efferocytosis-blocking NPs have promise both as a class of standalone cancer immunotherapy and as an adjuvant to improve response rates to checkpoint immunotherapy.",

The current treatment of colorectal MC is not precise enough, and the molecular characteristics remain unclear. The study aims to explore the difference between colorectal MC and AD on the transcriptome level for the possibility of treating colorectal MC precisely. METHODS: The data of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was assessed, and then differential analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to identify the differential hub RNAs between colorectal MC and AD. Differential hub lncRNAs and hub RNA of significant modules were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) among different colon cancer cell lines. RESULTS: In total, 1680 differential expressed RNAs (DERs) were found by comparing colorectal MC (52, 13.3%) with AD (340, 86.7%). Through the WGCNA, a mucin-associated RNA module was identified, while some others might be associated with unique immune progress. Finally, 6 differential hub RNAs in the mucin-associated RNA module (CTD-2589M5.4, RP11-234B24.2, RP11-25K19.1 and COLCA1) were validated by qRT-PCR and showed higher expression levels in mucin-producing colorectal cell lines (Ls174T and HT-29). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that clinical treatments for colorectal MC should be differentiated from AD. Further exploration of enterocyte (goblet cell) differentiation with tumor genesis and the distinct immune progression of MC may help to identify key therapeutic targets for colorectal MC. Further research on the application of immunotherapy to colorectal MC is needed.",

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma, significantly driven by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, represents a major global health challenge due to late-stage diagnosis and limited treatment options. This study utilized bioinformatics to analyze data from GEO and TCGA, aiming to uncover molecular biomarkers that bridge NAFLD to HCC. Through identifying critical genes and pathways, our research seeks to advance early detection and develop targeted therapies, potentially improving prognosis and personalizing treatment for NAFLD-HCC patients. OBJECTIVES: Identify key genes that differ between NAFLD and HCC; Analyze these genes to understand their roles in disease progression; Validate the functions of these genes in NAFLD to HCC transition. METHODS: Initially, we identified a set of genes differentially expressed in both NAFLD and HCC using second-generation sequencing data from the GEO and TCGA databases. We then employed a Cox proportional hazards model and a Lasso regression model, applying machine learning techniques to the large sample data from TCGA. This approach was used to screen for key disease-related genes, and an external dataset was utilized for model validation. Additionally, pseudo-temporal sequencing analysis of single-cell sequencing data was performed to further examine the variations in these genes in NAFLD and HCC. RESULTS: The machine learning analysis identified IGSF3, CENPW, CDT1, and CDC6 as key genes. Furthermore, constructing a machine learning model for CDT1 revealed it to be the most critical gene, with model validation yielding an ROC value greater than 0.80. The single-cell sequencing data analysis confirmed significant variations in the four predicted key genes between the NAFLD and HCC groups. CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the pivotal role of CDT1 in the progression from NAFLD to HCC.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing health concern, particularly in Africa, and is predicted to become the leading cause of death after cancer by 2050. Factors like overuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics contribute to this crisis. People living with HIV (PLWH) are particularly vulnerable to AMR with potential drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral and antimicrobial agents against common organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There is limited data on the concentrations of commonly used antimicrobial agents in people living with HIV in resource-limited settings. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) offers a promising approach to optimize antibiotic dosing and improve treatment outcomes for those with sub-optimal drug concentrations. TDM has been recommended for PLWH on anti-tuberculosis treatment due to sub-optimal drug concentrations found in a significant proportion of those with TB. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this study are to determine the concentrations of selected antimicrobial agents in people living with HIV requiring antimicrobial therapy and to assess the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in achieving therapeutic targets for PLWH receiving rifampicin and isoniazid for the treatment of tuberculosis. METHODS: This prospective observational study will enroll adult PLWH receiving amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, isoniazid, or ceftriaxone. Concentrations of these antibiotics will be measured locally using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. TDM with dose adjustment will be performed in a subset of participants on TB treatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using non-linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: This study was reviewed and approved by the research and ethics committee in February 2024. Participant enrolment began in September 2024. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the findings from this research will characterize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics relationships to predict treatment response for optimal antimicrobial therapeutic and anti-tuberculosis dosing among people living with HIV (PLWH).

    "AbstractText": "Thymoquinone (Tq) and gallic acid (GA) are known for counter-tumorigenic characteristics. GA inhibits cancer cell proliferation by interfering with many apoptotic signaling pathways, producing more reactive oxygen species (ROS), focusing on the cell cycle, and suppressing the expression of oncogenes and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, thymoquinone (after reducing to thymohydroquinone) and gallic acid are esterified to form thymohydroquinyl gallate (a prodrug). Thymohydroquinyl gallate (THQG) possesses enhanced antineoplastic efficacy and targeted delivery potential. The chemical and spectroscopic analysis confirms ester synthesis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed as nanocarriers due to their physicochemical and optical characteristics, biocompatibility, and low toxicity. As an efficient drug transporter, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) shield conjugated drugs from enzymatic digestion. The prodrug acts as a reducing agent for Au metal atoms and is loaded onto it after reduction. The nano drug is radiolabeled with 99mTc and 131I to monitor the drug biodistribution in animals using a gamma camera and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). 131I is an antineoplastic that helps enhance the drug's efficiency. Chromatographic results reveal promising radiolabeling percentages. In vitro, drug release shows sustained release at pH⁓5.8. In vitro 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay reveals drug potency on CAL 27 and MCF 7 cell lines.",

    "AbstractText": "This study evaluates the utility of machine learning (ML) algorithms in early forecasting of total symptom score changes from daily self-reports of 339 chemotherapy patients. The dataset comprised 12 specific symptoms, with severity and distress for each symptom rated on a 1 to 10 scale, generating a \"total symptom score\" ranging from 0 to 230. To address the challenge of an unbalanced original dataset, where Class I (score change ≥ 5) and Class II (score change < 5) were unevenly represented, we created a balanced dataset specifically for model training. This process involved a stratified sampling technique to ensure equitable representation of both classes, enhancing the predictive analysis. Using the MATLAB® Classification Learner application, we investigated nine ML models, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines (SVM), and others, each applying various classifiers. The objective was to predict the total symptom score change based on the preceding 3 to 5 days' symptom data. Models were trained on the balanced dataset to mitigate the original imbalance's impact, with comparative evaluations also conducted on the unbalanced data to assess performance differences. The analysis revealed that certain classifiers, such as SVM, delivered optimal performance on the unbalanced dataset, with an accuracy rate peaking at 82%. Yet, these models tended to frequently misclassify Class I as Class II. In contrast, the Ensemble algorithm equipped with the RUSBoost classifier demonstrated exceptional skill in accurately classifying both classes on both datasets, achieving accuracies of 59%, 59.3%, and 59.4% for data from 3, 4, and 5 days prior, respectively. Notably, these figures slightly improved to 61.16%, 58.41%, and 60.05% upon utilizing the balanced dataset for training. The deployment of a balanced dataset for model training underscores the significant potential of ML algorithms in improving symptom management for chemotherapy patients, offering a path to enhanced patient care and quality of life through targeted, personalized symptom monitoring.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Unlocking Early Cancer Detection: Leveraging Machine Learning in Cell-Free DNA Analysis for Precision Oncology.",
    "AbstractText": "This study introduces a groundbreaking approach to early cancer detection through the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), utilizing machine learning algorithms to navigate the complexities of low circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fractions and genetic heterogeneity. CfDNA, found in bodily fluids and comprising fragments from apoptotic or necrotic cells, offers a non-invasive means to identify cancer signals. With ctDNA-a subset of cfDNA from cancer cells-serving as a biomarker, the potential for detecting cancer at its earliest stages is vastly improved, enhancing treatment effectiveness and patient prognosis. However, the challenges of distinguishing cancer-specific signatures within cfDNA due to low ctDNA levels and the noise of genetic heterogeneity necessitate advanced methods beyond traditional mutation analysis. Leveraging high-throughput sequencing technologies and the precision of machine learning, our research aims to surmount these obstacles by identifying nuanced cancer signatures within cfDNA sequencing data. Machine learning's capability to model complex data relationships allows for the differentiation of subtle oncogenic patterns from background noise, thereby increasing the diagnostic accuracy of liquid biopsies. This paper outlines our exploration into employing machine learning for early cancer detection via cfDNA, detailing our method of transforming sequencing data into analyzable formats, enhancing signal detection through a sliding window technique, and predicting true tumor-origin fragments. By advancing cfDNA-based cancer diagnostics, this research not only signifies a leap towards more sensitive and specific early-stage cancer detection but also opens avenues for personalized oncology, where treatment strategies are informed by the unique genetic profile unveiled through cfDNA analysis. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with liquid biopsy technologies to revolutionize cancer diagnostics, offering new hope for early detection and personalized treatment pathways.",

In this study, we present a meta-learning-based approach for predicting lung cancer from gene expression profiles. We apply this framework to well-established deep learning methodologies and employ four distinct datasets for the meta-learning tasks, where one as the target dataset and the rest as source datasets. Our approach is evaluated against both traditional and deep learning methodologies, and the results show the superior performance of meta-learning on augmented source data compared to the baselines trained on single datasets. Moreover, we conduct the comparative analysis between meta-learning and transfer learning methodologies to highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges associated with limited sample sizes.

Quantifying breast arterial calcification (BAC) from screening mammograms is a non-invasive and cost-efficient approach to assess the future risk of adverse cardiovascular events among women, such as heart attack and stroke. However, segmentation of breast arterial calcification is an involved task and poses several technical challenges such as extremely small BAC finding, low breast arteries to breast area ratio in the mammogram images, tissue features such as breast folds and heterogeneous density, have very similar imaging appearance. In this work, we aim to address the shortcomings of existing SOTA methods, e.g., SCUNet, and analyze the comparative performance. Given the fact that we will not be able to simply resize mammogram to preserve the microscopic BAC details, we adopted a patch-based methodology for segmentation using the original resolution which may hinder the model understanding of whole mammogram. We propose a multi-task learning approach for patch-based BAC segmentation by adding an auxiliary task of patch position prediction which forces the model to learn breast anatomy to comprehend the locations where BAC will not occur, such as breast boundary. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines. To demonstrate the utility, we also validate our method on external data and provide survival analysis for adverse cardiac events based on difference in BAC score and provide a comparison with coronary calcium score (CAC).",

Current guidelines exclude individuals with a history of in utero exposure to DES. This clinical consensus includes a systematic review of relevant studies and provides updated guidance for surveillance of the aging DES-exposed cohort. METHODS: A literature search was performed to find all relevant DES and clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) papers that addressed key clinical questions. Study quality was assessed and recommendations were rated on strength (A-E) and quality of evidence (I-III) using the system described for previous American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology consensus guidelines. RESULTS: DES-exposed patients were 40 times more likely (standardized incidence ratio = 40.9; 95% CI, 13.1-126.2) to develop cervical and vaginal CCAs compared with unexposed individuals, with most cases diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 15 and 31. DES exposure in utero significantly increases the risk of CCA compared with nonexposed people, but the absolute risk of CCA is low. While CCA does seem to occur in older exposed patients, cases were rare and calculated incidence rates were extremely low, with the largest in any of the cohorts at 2.86 per million women-years. CONCLUSIONS: The American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommends people with prenatal exposure to DES receive annual screening for CCA with cytology until the age of 65 and discontinue screening beyond the age of 65 provided they otherwise meet criteria for cessation of screening.",

Pharmacists' authority and knowledge of biosimilars correlated with their intention to substitute or dispense them. However, the logistic regression analysis indicated that behavioral, normative, and control beliefs were not significant predictors of the intention to prescribe or substitute biosimilars in either group. Conclusions: Highlighting the significance of continuing education and coordinating efforts in the international harmonization of biosimilar guidelines, as well as education for healthcare professionals, is required for addressing clinical concerns and enhancing confidence in biosimilars.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The role of RAC1 in resistance to targeted therapies in cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "RAC1 is a small 21 kDa RHO GTPase that plays a pivotal role in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell growth. Alterations in the activity of RAC1 are implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer. Increased RAC1 activity, due to overexpression and/or activating mutations, drives transcriptional upregulation, reactive oxygen species production, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, membrane ruffling, and uncontrolled cell proliferation, which are hallmarks of an oncogenic phenotype. While RAC1-activating mutations alone do not appear sufficient to transform cells, their combination with other common mutations, such as BRAF, NRAS, or NF1, have been linked to drug resistance and significantly worsen patient prognosis and hinder treatment responses. The precise mechanisms underlying drug resistance, and the regulation of RAC1 splicing remain poorly understood. RAC1 is a challenging therapeutic target due to its ubiquitous presence and essential cellular functions. To date, there are no established standard treatments for cancers that harbour an additional RAC1 mutation or for RAC1-mediated drug resistance. Current experimental strategies aim to target RAC1 localization, its activators (e.g. guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and downstream effectors. Regulating RAC1 expression by targeting epigenetic regulators, and direct targeting of RAC1 itself, may also be possible in the near future.",

    "AbstractText": "The role of embryology in metazoan evolution is rooted deeply in the history of science. Viewing Neoplasia as an evolutionary engine provides a scientific basis for reexamining the disease cancer. Once the embryo is understood as a benign tumor with a pivotal role in the evolution of all animal forms, there will be an immediate paradigm shift in the search for cancer cure, potentially revealing insights that may be buried within the great developmental transitions of metazoans. This article discusses one of the unifying principles between embryology and oncology, namely cancer stem cells. Some considerations are also provided on the central role of physics and biomechanics in the assembly of the first embryo, which can be regarded as a differentiated benign tumor. Mechanical impregnation of the nucleus of a stem cell, culminating in a totipotent/multipotent cell, was a major event safeguarding the success of embryogenesis throughout evolution. Germ cells in the earliest ctenophore embryos underwent delayed differentiation, subsequent to the mechanical assembly of the embryo. Finally, a discussion is presented on the concept that cancer and embryogenesis (cancer and healthy stem cells) are two sides of the same coin, that is, of the same process. The only difference is that cancer stem cells reveal themselves in inappropriate contexts. Neoplasia is a free force, whereas cancer is a force contained by animal organization.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Mechanobiological cues to bone cells during early metastasis drive later osteolysis: A computational mechanoregulation framework prediction.",
    "AbstractText": "Bone cells contribute to tumour metastasis by producing biochemical factors that stimulate tumour cell homing and proliferation, but also by resorbing bone matrix (osteolysis) that releases further stimulatory factors for tumour growth in a vicious cycle. Changes in the local mechanical environment of bone tissue occur during early metastasis, which might activate mechanobiological responses by resident bone cells (osteocytes) to activate resorption (osteoclasts) and thereby contribute to tumour invasion. The objective of this study is to investigate whether bone osteolysis is driven by early changes in the bone mechanical environment during metastasis by (a) implementing subject-specific FE models of metastatic femora to predict the mechanical environment within bone tissue during early metastasis (3-weeks after tumour inoculation) and then (b) applying mechanoregulation theory to predict bone tissue remodelling as a function of the evolving mechanical environment within bone tissue during breast cancer-bone metastasis. We implemented a global resorption rate derived from an experimental model, but the mechanoregulation algorithm predicted localised bone loss in the greater trochanter region, the same region where osteolysis was prevalent after three weeks of metastasis development in the animal model. Moreover, the mechanical environment evolved in a similar manner to that reported in separate subject-specific finite element models of these same animals by 6 weeks. Thus, we propose that early changes in the physical environment of bone tissue during metastasis may elicit mechanobiological cues for bone cells and activate later osteolytic bone destruction.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Cardiovascular and metabolic effects of ovarian suppression in combination with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor as adjuvant therapy for early oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer: a systematic review.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Adjuvant endocrine therapy is a key treatment in oestrogen receptor positive early breast cancer (BC). For premenopausal women, ovarian function suppression (OFS) in combination with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) is utilised in high-risk cases. The resultant suppression of circulating oestradiol from OFS could have adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects, subsequently increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search of online databases was conducted to identify randomised control trials involving OFS which reported cardiovascular and metabolic adverse events. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Four studies with a total of 7808 participants were included in the analysis. Tamoxifen alone carries a lower risk of hypertension compared with tamoxifen plus OFS (4.81% vs. 7.57%, OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49-0.91; p = 0.01). The tamoxifen alone group showed a lower risk of hyperglycaemia compared to tamoxifen with OFS (0.10% vs. 0.86%, OR = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.85, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential cardio-metabolic impact of endocrine therapy and OFS on premenopausal women with BC. It also highlights the pressing need for standardisation of routine collection and recording of cardiometabolic history and risk factors as part of baseline assessment and adverse event reporting to better understand the cardiometabolic impact these treatments have on our patients. Further studies, with particular focus on baseline and subsequent development of cardiovascular risk factors, are needed to explore the impact of these drugs on the cardiovascular health of young women with BC.",

This study was designed to study the role of the SP1/SNHG16/GLUT1 axis in prostate cancer (PCa) via modulation of glucose metabolism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The expression profile of SNHG16 in PCa tissues was obtained from the online public database GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/). Human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, were used in this study. Real-time qPCR was employed to determine the mRNA expression levels of SNHG16 and GLUT1. To assess cellular proliferation, CCK-8 assays were performed. Cellular invasion was evaluated using Transwell assays, and glycolysis was monitored through glucose uptake, lactate production, and ATP generation measurements. RESULTS: Analysis of GEPIA2 data revealed upregulation of SNHG16 in PCa tissues and a positive association between GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and SP1/SNHG16 expression in the correlation study. Consistently, SPI and SNHG16 were either overexpressed or knocked down in PCa cells to reveal the role of the SP1/SNHG16/GLUT1 axis. The results demonstrated that PC-3 and DU145 cell proliferation was promoted by the overexpression of either SPI or SNHG16. On the other hand, PC-3 and DU145 cell proliferation was reduced upon knockdown of SP1 or SNHG16. A real-time qPCR study revealed that GLUT1 mRNA was upregulated by SP1/SNHG16 overexpression and downregulated by SP1/SNHG16 knockdown. In PCa cells, overexpression of SNHG16/SP1 resulted in enhanced utilization of glucose, lactose, and ATP production, whereas SNHG16/SP1 knockdown had the reverse effect. Lastly, Transwell assay results showed that overexpression of SNHG16/SP1 promoted, while knockdown of SNHG16/SP1 inhibited, the invasiveness of PC-3 and DU145 PCa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the evidence indicates that the SP1/SNHG16/GLUT1 axis regulates proliferation of PCa cells via the glycolytic route and thus may act as a therapeutic target for PCa treatment.",

We systematically evaluated the efficacy and harms of the use of β-blockers in breast cancer and lymphoma patients undergoing chemotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched five engines, and pre-prints until October 10, 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating β-blockers for anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity in breast cancer and lymphoma patients. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter (LVEDD, LVESD), peak E' velocity, E/A ratio, E/e' ratio, and NT-pro BNP levels. The secondary outcome was heart rate. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed, and we used GRADE methods to assess quality of evidence (QoE). RESULTS: Twelve RCTs were selected (n = 1,794). Seven RCTs evaluated carvedilol. Mean ages were 39 to 52 years; 88.5% were women; 79.4% had breast cancer, and 11.5% lymphoma. The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of β-blockers on all-cause mortality (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.37, 12 RCTs, I 2 = 0%, very low QoE), LVEF (MD = 2.73%, 95% CI: -0.45% to 5.92%, 12 RCTs, I 2 = 93%, very low QoE), and heart rate (MD = -9.14 bpm, 95% CI: -15.02 to -3.26, two RCTs, I 2 = 87%, very low QoE) vs. controls. β-blockers likely reduced NT-pro BNP levels slightly (MD = -15.35 pg/ml, 95% CI: -22.39 to -8.31, two RCTs, I 2 = 0%, moderate QoE). There were no effects on other outcomes, all with very low QoE. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic use of β-blockers for cardioprotection had little to no effect on all-cause mortality, LVEF or cardiac function outcomes in cancer patients undergoing anthracycline therapy.",

Beyond aluminum adjuvants, liposomes show efficient adjuvant effects through regulating the accumulation, internalization and release of payloads. However, it remains unknown that whether the liposome will perform intrinsic adjuvant effects in the absence of antigens and adjuvants. Herein, a library of antigen/adjuvant-free liposomes with variable surface charges has been developed and it has been found that highly anionic liposomes show promising adjuvant effects for boosting immune responses. The anionic liposome mobilizes the MyD88 pathways of dendritic cells (DCs) to activate T helper cells and CD8+ T cells. The anionic liposomes enhance host immunity by regulating the population of Th1, Th2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), and boost adaptive CD8+ T cells in lymphoid organs with good biosafety. It shows the most efficient protection against MC38 colorectal cancer in mice after a parallel injection of antigens and anionic liposomes. Overall, this study reveals that the surface charge of liposome affects its adjuvant efficiency and provides an anionic nanosized adjuvant formulation for enhancing immunization.",

UVB-induced inflammasome activation in epidermal keratinocytes mediates the cutaneous inflammatory response, but the intracellular machinery that maintains skin homeostasis by suppressing UVB-induced inflammasome activation is unclear. Here, we summarize our recent work on the protective role of alternative autophagy against UVB-induced NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation in human keratinocytes. We found that UVB radiation induces ATG5/ATG7-independent alternative (noncanonical) autophagy, which leads to suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the clearance of damaged mitochondria in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. Our findings indicate that ATG5/ATG7-independent alternative autophagy, rather than conventional autophagy, may play a key role in mitigating inflammatory responses, and restoring skin homeostasis after UV radiation.",

Type I IFNs, particularly IFNβ, activate signaling pathways that induce the expression of these chemokines. In our recent study, we explored the impact and underlying mechanisms of inhibiting the kinase activity of VPS34, a key lipid kinase in the autophagy/endosomal trafficking system, on the expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 in preclinical cancer mouse models. Using NanoString gene expression technology, we analyzed tumors from mice treated with the VPS34 inhibitor SB02024 and demonstrated that the expression of CCL5 and CXCL10 is increased through a cGAS-STING-dependent mechanism within cancer cells. In vitro, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic targeting of VPS34 enhance cGAS-STING-mediated expression and secretion of CCL5 and CXCL10 across various tumor cell types. In vivo, treatment with the VPS34 inhibitor SB02024 enhances the positive effects of the STING agonist ADU-S100 in melanoma tumor-bearing mice. Thus, our study suggests that VPS34 inhibitors could be used to enhance STING-based anticancer therapies.

    "AbstractText": "Olaparib has been approved as a treatment for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in patients with BRCA1 (BRCA1 DNA repair associated) or BRCA2 mutations. However, a large portion of pancreatic cancer patients either exhibit inherent resistance or develop resistance over time. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive this resistance is crucial to develop more effective targeted therapies. In this study, we found that NLRP4 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 4) upregulation is associated with increased resistance to olaparib in pancreatic cancer. In addition, NLRP4 plays a role in both the DNA damage response (DDR) and autophagy. Specifically, NLRP4 enhances DNA repair capacity and leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and autophagy upon olaparib treatment. Notably, NLRP4-generated mitochondrial ROS promote autophagy without directly impacting DNA damage. Inhibition of either mitochondrial ROS production with MitoQ or autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) could sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to olaparib. These findings emphasize NLRP4's role in promoting both autophagy and DNA repair in response to olaparib, suggesting that patients with low NLRP4 expression might respond more favorably to olaparib treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "Autophagy has been associated with responses to chemotherapies in several types of cancer, highlighting its contribution to the development of resistance to treatments. Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common tumors and is known for its ability to develop resistance to treatments. Doxorubicin (DXR) is a drug commonly used in BC and known to damage mitochondria. Thus, we thought to investigate if DXR treatment induces mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy specifically degrading mitochondria, in BC cells. By performing a global analysis of mitophagy-associated genes, we found a relationship between their expressions and DXR treatment. We revealed that PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy is induced following DXR treatment in different cellular BC models, such as the luminal subtype A cell line MCF7 and in the triple-negative BC cell line MDA-MB-231. By Interfering the E3 ubiquitin ligase PARKIN using miR-218-5p, we showed the efficacy in specifically targeting mitophagy in the treatment of BC. Indeed, PARKIN depletion improves cancer cells sensitivity to DXR treatment in vitro, in both stem-like and non-stem-like BC cells. Our approach, which combines two tumoricidal methods, mitophagy inhibition and chemotherapy, could therefore represent a new strategy for BC treatment.

Physical activity is often recommended to PCa patients due to its benefits in preventing disease recurrence and managing treatment-related side effects. However, physical activity may be challenging for elderly or bedridden patients. As such, vibration therapy has been proposed as a safe, effective, and easy to perform alternative treatment that may confer similar effects as physical exercise. Specifically, low-magnitude high frequency (LMHF) vibration has been shown to decrease breast cancer extravasation into the bone and reduce other types of cancer proliferation by impacting cell viability. Here, we investigated the effects of daily application of LMHF vibration (0.3 ​g, 60 ​Hz, 1 ​hour/day for 3 days) on prostate cancer growth and bone metastasis in vitro. Our findings suggest that LMHF vibration significantly reduces colony formation through a decrease in cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, using a 3D cell culture model, LMHF vibration significantly reduces PC3 spheroid size. Additionally, LMHF vibration reduces PCa cell extravasation into the bone microenvironment through the stimulation of osteocytes and subsequent osteocyte-endothelial cell cross talk.

Understanding how the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacts with biomechanical forces to drive changes to ovarian cancer cell behaviors could elucidate novel treatment strategies for this patient population. Additionally, limitations in current preclinical models of the ovarian TME do not permit investigation of crosstalk between signaling pathways and mechanical forces. Our study focused on uncovering how strains and hyaluronic acid (HA) interact to signal through the CD44 receptor to alter ovarian cancer cell growth, migration, and response to a commonly used chemotherapy, paclitaxel.

This study evaluated early myocardial dysfunction using two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography in breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines. METHODOLOGY: Sixty-two patients with anthracycline naïve breast cancer and 62 controls were studied. All patients were treated with standard regimens containing epirubicin. Echocardiography was done at three time points (baseline, one month and three months). Left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain were measured. RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 47.6±10.46 years, obesity was the most common co-morbidity (27.4%) followed by hypertension (14.5%). Over the three month-follow-up period, the left atrial volume increased from 21.4±6.90mls/m2 at baseline to 24.8±6.38mls/m2, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 62.4±9.35% at baseline to 54.8±7.22%, and the average left ventricular global longitudinal strain decreased from -19.0±5.91% at baseline to -16.1±3.70% by three month-follow-up.

This study aimed to investigate the association between COVID-19 mortality and underlying disease in Tehran. METHODS: The retrospective, epidemiological study was conducted from January 1, 2019, to May 31, 2021, in hospitals in Tehran, Iran based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Data concerning coronary cases with underlying disease (8018) and related demographic and clinical characteristics are collected by hospitals. Additionally, logistic regression was examined to determine the association between COVID-19 mortality and underlying disease. RESULTS: The result shows that incurable diseases (47.3%) and cancer (67.7%) had the lowest while; pulmonary disease showed the highest recovery day (80.7%) between various underlying conditions. In addition, cancer and pulmonary disease show 10.41 and 7.3 hospitalization days, respectively. The logistic regression analysis revealed that mortality in cases with cancer as an underlying disease is 4.72 times higher than in cases without cancer (95% CI: 4.08-5.46). Moreover, the adjusted regression analysis showed that the mortality in multiple underlying conditions such as cancer, respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and diabetes are 5.48, 2.75, 4.081, and 3.162 times higher, respectively (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide valuable insights into how specific underlying health conditions can increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality, hospitalization, and recovery time.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Ovarian/Tubal Pathology in Premenopausal Women with Breast Cancer: A Prospective Study.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is most common cancer among women and hereditary mutations account for 5-10%. HBOC syndrome is most common hereditary mutation affecting breast & ovary. The prevalence of STIC lesions in these women ranges from 2 to 12% and that in general population is unknown. Role of risk reduction salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is well established among these women. Surgical ovarian ablation also plays role in hormone positive breast cancers in prolonging their survival by permanent hormone suppression. The role of oophorectomy has different impacts in breast cancer. METHODOLOGY: The study aimed to determine the different indications for oophorectomy and their histologies among premenopausal breast cancer women. This was a prospective cross sectional study of breast cancer women diagnosed ≤ 50 years of age. All these women underwent genetic counselling, gynaecology examination, transvaginal scan &CA 125 testing. Surgery was offered to women with BRCA mutations (RRSO) and also for hormone receptor positive women (surgical ovarian ablation). Histopathologies of these women were analysed using SEE-FIM protocol. RESULTS: A total of 98 breast cancer women were identified. The median age was 41.5 years (SD 5.7) & median CA 125 was 9.3 (IQR 6-20.5). The genetic acceptance rate was 18%. Four patients were germline BRCA 1/2 positive, 1 VUS, 13 negative and 80 didn't opt for test. Ultrasound imaging showed cystic ovaries among 12 patients. Most of them had benign features. Twenty two patients underwent surgery (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy)-3 BRCA positive and rest for hormone positive breast cancer. Histopathologies were normal except for Krukenberg's mets in one hormone positive breast cancer patient. CONCLUSION: The incidence of germline mutations in our study was 5%. STIC lesions were not detected in our study, attributing to low acceptance of genetic testing. The value of screening for ovarian cancer was limited. Incorporation of genetics into routine gynaecology oncology clinic needs further addressal. Our study opened the doors for the genetic awareness among these young women.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence of lymphedema in patients undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer and to see whether sentinel node mapping and biopsy results in reduced rates of lymphedema compared to PLND. METHODS: A retrospective single institution analysis including all patients who underwent surgery with nodal assessment for proven or suspected endometrial cancer between January 2010 and July 2021. Patients without 1-year postoperative follow-up were excluded from analysis. Data were obtained from electronic medical records. Each hemipelvis was considered a unit of study. SPSS v.20 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 816 hemipelvises in 408 patients, 486 underwent SLNB and 330 PLND.Mean age of SLNB group was younger (57 y and 59.8 y, P < 0.001). Both the groups had similar confounding comorbidities. A mean of 2 (0-8) nodes were obtained in SLNB group and 7 (range 1-26) in PLND group. Average duration of surgery was 123.3 and 197.4min (p < 0.001), and blood loss was 41 and 221.8 ml (p < 0.001) with SLNB and PLND, respectively.Side-specific lymphedema occurred in 6.37% with PLND and 1.23% with SLNB (p < 0.001). Additionally, 1.7% patients in the PLND group and none in SLNB group reported heaviness of the lower limb without clinically obvious edema (p = 0.005). Two patients with edema after SLNB had varicose veins ipsilaterally. Pelvic Lymphocele was seen in 2.33% patients after PLND and 0.19% after SLNB (p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: The present study shows that SLNB is associated with substantially reduced incidence of lymphedema with significantly lower operative time and blood loss.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide with gradually increasing incidence and mortality rate. The most recent classification of endometrial carcinoma (EC) with diagnostic flowchart includes both immunohistochemical and molecular markers for prognostic purpose and better management of endometrial cancer. In this study, we want to analyze various immunohistochemical (IHC) markers in EC and their prognostic significance. METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted from August 2016 to February 2024. We studied 168 cases of EC for histopathological subtypes, grading and various IHC markers such as Estrogen Receptor (ER), Her 2 Neu, Cytokeratin 5/6, Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) and p53. RESULTS: In our study, most common histological subtype was endometrioid (132) followed by serous (17), mucinous (8), clear cell (7) and carcinosarcoma (4). ER expression was mostly seen in endometrioid type. Loss of ER expression and Her 2 expression along with p53 over expression was not only associated with high grade EC but also with advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical markers play a definite role in risk stratification and specific individual oriented therapy in endometrial cancer patients.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: In India, the incidence of uterine cancer is 17,420 per year. Presence of mismatch repair genes is one of the risk factors which can cause microsatellite instability in DNA leading to hereditary syndromes as well as sporadic cancer. In the present study, we aim to determine the prevalence of MMR gene mutations by IHC staining for MMR proteins in endometrial cancer. We further aim to corelate various clinic-pathological features with mismatch repair gene defect (MMRd) cancers and to determine its effects recurrence and survival in endometrial cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an ambispective study of a retrospectively selected cohort followed up prospectively. It was conducted in the Department of Gynaecological Oncology, AIMS. The cohort was evaluated for the four MMR proteins via IHC staining, and their various clinic-pathological factors were studied. Also, the factors affecting their recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed. RESULTS: The prevalence of MMR loss in endometrial cancer patients was 31.34%. Most common loss of MMR gene was MLH1 and PMS 2 (57.14%). We did not find any significant differences pertaining to age, BMI, menstrual status, family history and second malignancies in both groups of endometrial cancers. While comparing the histopathological characteristics, no significant difference was found regarding to histopathology, stage, type, grade, P53 status, tumour size, lymph node involvement and LVSI status. No significant difference was seen between two groups in RFS and OS. CONCLUSION: We found a significant proportion of endometrial cancers with defective MMR genes in Indian population. We did not find any correlation of MMR to the various clinical and histopathological factors that we analysed. MMRd did not significantly affect the RFS and OS in endometrial cancers.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Anti-apoptotic Role of Bcl-2-Associated Athanogene-3 Protein Overexpression in the Pathogenesis of Endometrial Cancers: An Aid for New Therapeutic Targets.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Bcl-2-associated athanogene-3 (BAG-3) is a cytoplasmic multidomain protein member that belongs to the BAG family of co-chaperones that are known to be involved in several cellular processes, including control of apoptosis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Normal tissues show weak to negligible expression as it is downregulated. However, its expression is upregulated in various epithelial and hematological malignancies, including endometrial, cervical, and chronic lymphoid leukemia. It plays a vital role in tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and therapy resistance; thus, its expression has been determined to be a valuable tool in developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Endometrial cancers are one of the most common female genital tract malignancies with high mortality. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the BAG-3 protein immunoexpression in 33 cases of endometrial cancer and correlated its expression with prognostic determiners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of BAG-3 immunoexpression in 33 cases of endometrial carcinoma. Cytoplasmic and membranous staining was considered positive and its correlations with prognostic factors such as myometrial invasion, LVSI, and ovarian involvement were analyzed. RESULTS: BAG-3 immunopositivity was seen in 31 (93.9%) cases and two cases were found to be negative. Twenty-two (66.6%) showed strong (3 +) intensity, seven (21.2%) showed moderate, and two (6.1%) showed weak BAG-3 immunostaining. No significant correlation was seen between grade and intensity. CONCLUSION: Inhibiting BAG-3 expression can induce apoptosis, thus promoting a new therapeutic target for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the one of the most constantly diagnosed and leading cause of cancer death in women, with an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide. One woman dies of cervical cancer every 9 min in India. Despite its high incidence, the knowledge and awareness regarding cervical cancer and its screening is limited. This study aims to estimate the proportion of preinvasive lesions of cervix among healthy and immunocompromised individuals. METHODS: An observative cross-sectional study done in a tertiary care centre from January 2021 to June 2022 among 250 normal and 250 immunocompromised individual's attending tertiary care centre. Coloscopy guided biopsy was taken for histopathological examination after informed and written consent. RESULTS: The proportion of preinvasive lesion of cervix among 500 individuals is 8.2% (41). The proportion of preinvasive lesion among normal individuals is 5.2% (13) and among immunocompromised individual is 11.2% (28). Most of the positive cases, 46% (19) were seen in women with more than two children. 75% (31) of positive cases were seen in women who had their first coitus at age less than 21 yrs. 87.8% of positive cases were seen in women not using any method of contraception. CONCLUSION: Preinvasive lesions are more common in immune compromised and it is precisely clear that all women must undergo cervical cancer screening as cervical cancer is the most common among women. \"Prevention is better than cure\"-Screening and early treatment of preinvasive lesion is cost-effective way to prevent cancer cervix.",

Our objective was to understand the survival outcome in stage IV EOC patients treated with curative intent. METHODS: Data of 895 patients were retrospectively reviewed from the medical records department from the period of January 2014 to December 2018 at Malabar Cancer Centre in India. Patients with stage IV disease were selected for further analysis. Five-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were examined. RESULTS: There were a total of 60 patients with stage IV EOC of which only 41 who underwent primary/interval cytoreductive surgery and 11 underwent only chemotherapy. The median follow-up period was 71 months. The overall survival (OS) rates at 2, 3, and 5 years were 69.2%, 47.9%, and 22.5%, respectively. The median OS was 34.5 months (95% CI 18.17-50.82), and median RFS was 12 months (95% CI 10.3-13.7). Patients not operated had worse overall survival compared to those who went surgical debulking (p < 0.013). Ascites (HR 0.383 95% CI 0.16-0.88) and optimal cytoreduction (HR 3.004 95% CI 1.20-7.50) were the only variables found to be significant predictors of overall survival.

The goal of this study is to assess the potential prognostic effect of associated peritoneal carcinomatosis and PCI in stage II and III EOC patients after undergoing complete cytoreduction (CC score 0 or 1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study including 50 high-grade serous EOC cases treated and followed up from 2012 and 2016. Twenty-three cases had peritoneal nodules at the time of exploration. PCI was assessed intraoperatively in each case. Twenty-seven cases had no peritoneal nodules (were given PCI 0). RESULTS: The presence of peritoneal nodules, presence of ascites, and stage of the disease had statistically significant impact on overall survival, but with multivariate analysis, only presence of peritoneal nodules was associated with a statistically significant reduced overall survival (HR 6.192; 95% CI 1.248-30.720; P value 0.026). The presence of peritoneal nodules was associated with a statistically significant higher incidence of postoperative death (P value 0.038). PCI had no statistically significant impact on overall survival, disease-free survival, or incidence of postoperative death (within 30 days after surgery).

METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included women operated for gynaecological carcinoma following a previous treated malignancy, in the gynaecologic oncology department of a tertiary care hospital, between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2021. Demographic details, clinical and pathological characteristics of the current malignancy and previous malignancy were obtained from medical records and analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During this period, 2370 women with gynaecological malignancies were operated, of whom 27 (1.1%) patients had gynaecological malignancy as a second malignancy. This included 19 (70.3%) endometrial and 8 (29.6%) ovarian cancer patients following a median period of 48 (24-144 months) from the index malignancy. Their median age and BMI were 60 years (37-67) and 27 (17-39.1), respectively. Endometrioid endometrial cancer was most common and was preceded by breast carcinoma in 19 (70.37%) and colorectal in 5 (18.5%). Four patients had previous microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer. Two patients were found to have mismatch repair deficient endometrial cancer on somatic testing. High-grade serous carcinoma was the most common ovarian histology and was preceded by breast cancer in 6 (75%). Four patients underwent germline testing, and one was found to have a (breast cancer gene) BRCA pathogenic mutation. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer and colon cancer can precede gynaecologic cancer. Individualization of somatic and genetic testing in colorectal and breast cancers will allow screening and prevention of second gynaecologic malignancies.",

Asymptomatic postmenopausal women often display endometrial thickening, and research has shown associations between endometrial thicknesses of 5 mm or more and certain pathologies. However, it remains unclear whether specific pathologies are related to different diameters of thickened endometrium. AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the diameters of endometrial thickness its histopathology, and the related symptoms in postmenopausal women who have incidental endometrial thickening and are not experiencing vaginal bleeding. METHODS: This study was conducted in Alzahra Teaching Hospital of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. The inclusion criteria for the study comprised of postmenopausal women who had visited the clinics with symptoms other than vaginal bleeding and exhibited an endometrial thickness of more than 5 mm in ultrasound imaging. A total of eighty-four women were included in the final analysis. The participants were scheduled to undergo a Pap smear and endometrial biopsy (Pipelle biopsy). The histopathology of the endometrial samples was examined to test the research hypothesis. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant association between endometrial histopathologic findings and endometrial diameter (p-value = 0.12) or participants' chief complaints (p-value = 0.21).

No studies have been reported on the differences in the clinical profiles of patients based on EUS examination. We aim to study the variations in clinicopathological characteristics between two distinct endoscopic ultrasonographic manifestations of GSRCC. METHODS: A total of 302 patients with GSRCC confirmed by pathological examination who underwent EUS were enrolled in the study. Based on the endoscopic ultrasonographic features, patients were categorized into two groups: type 1, where the entire layer structure disappeared, and type 2, where the layer structure was still present and appeared lymphomatoid. Clinicopathologic features were collected retrospectively and analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with type 2 patients, type 1 patients tended to develop GSRCC at an older age (P = 0.033) and had higher serum levels of tumor markers and were more likely to experience anemia (P < 0.001) and weight loss (P < 0.001) during the disease progression. Significant increases in the tumor size (P < 0.001), thickness of the affected gastric wall (P < 0.001), and depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.001) were observed in type 1 patients. Furthermore, type 1 patients had higher prevalence of affected blood vessels (P < 0.001), nerves (P < 0.001), lymph nodes (P < 0.001), and peritoneal metastasis (P < 0.001). However, no difference was found in the duration of disease between the two groups, and all deficient mismatch repairs were observed in type 1 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The two distinct endoscopic ultrasonographic manifestations of GSRCC exhibited different clinicopathological characteristics, suggesting that they may represent different subtypes of the disease that require special attention in management strategies.",

This work aims to develop a deep learning (DL)-based image-guide framework to enable fast volumetric image reconstruction for accurate target localization for treating lung cancer patients with gating, and it is presented in the context of FLASH which leverages ultra-high dose-rate radiation to enhance the sparing of organs at risk without compromising tumor control probability. The proposed framework comprises four modules, including orthogonal kV x-ray projection acquisition, DL-based volumetric image generation, image quality analyses, and proton water equivalent thickness (WET) evaluation. We investigated volumetric image reconstruction using kV projection pairs with four different source angles. Thirty patients with lung targets were identified from an institutional database, each patient having a four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) dataset with ten respiratory phases. Considering all evaluation metrics, the kV projections with source angles of 135° and 225° yielded the optimal volumetric images. The patient-averaged mean absolute error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, and WET error were 75±22 HU, 19±3.7 dB, 0.938±0.044, and -1.3%±4.1%.

    "AbstractText": "Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models offer a more physiologically relevant and complex environment compared to traditional two-dimensional cultures, making them a promising tool for studying tumor biology and drug response. However, these models often face challenges in real-time monitoring of drug diffusion, penetration, and target engagement, limiting their predictive power for in vivo and clinical outcomes. This study introduces a novel approach for real-time tracking of drug permeability using small molecule drugs with GFP/RFP-disrupting properties that correlate with their efficacy. We developed a reproducible 3D spheroid model with various cancer cell lines expressing GFP/RFP for efficient drug screening. Through screening over 20 FDA-approved enzyme inhibitors, we identified three covalent kinase inhibitors-osimertinib, afatinib, and neratinib-that irreversibly disrupt GFP and RFP fluorescence. Our results reveal distinct drug diffusion and penetration profiles within GFP/RFP-expressing spheroids, varying with drug concentration and formulation, and correlating with clinical volume of distribution (Vd) values. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach is useful for evaluating different drug formulations as well as screening penetration enhancers for solid tumors. These findings offer a valuable 3D model for studying kinetics of drug permeability and efficacy in tumor-like environments, with potential implications for drug delivery research and formulation development.",

METHODS: In total, 114 patients with BC performed 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set (n = 79, 55 cases of Ki67 + and 24 cases of Ki67-) and a validation set (n = 35, 24 cases of Ki67 + and 11 cases of Ki67-). Thirteen clinical characteristics and 704 radiomics features were extracted, and 4 clinical and 8 radiomics features were selected. Three models were developed, including the clinical model, the radiomics model, and the combined model. Model performance was evaluated using the ROC curve, and clinical utility was assessed through decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The N stage, tumor morphology, SUVmax, and the longest diameter significantly differed between Ki67 + and Ki67- groups (all P < 0.05). Eight radiomics features were selected for the radiomics model. The area under the curve of the combined model in the training and test group was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82∼0.97) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.64∼0.99), respectively. The combined model significantly outperformed both the radiomics model and the clinical model alone (P < 0.05). The DCA curve demonstrated the superior clinical utility of the combined model compared to the clinical model and radiomics model.

Using the Japanese National Clinical Database (NCD), we added 2022 data to the 2018-2021 data to analyze the impacts of expansion of the COVID-19 infection and its spread on laparoscopic surgery (including robot-assisted surgery). METHODS: Data on patients who underwent LDG and LLAR for cancer were extracted from the NCD between 2018 and 2022. The numbers of LDG and LLAR were obtained, and morbidity and mortality rates were evaluated using a standardized morbidity/mortality ratio (SMR), i.e. the ratio of the observed number of incidences to expected number of incidences calculated by the risk calculator previously developed by the NCD. RESULTS: The numbers of LDG and LLAR cases declined in 2020, the first pandemic year, and continued to decline in 2022 to the same level as 2021, but with no further decline and no recovery trend in the number of cases. Numbers of robot-assisted LDG and LLAR cases increased but at a rate lower than the prepandemic increase. Mortality and anastomotic leakage, two very important complications assessed in SMR, did not worsen during the pandemic compared to prepandemic levels. CONCLUSION: In Japan, laparoscopic surgery was safe and unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, even in 2022, when the epidemic spread.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Novel body component score predicts long-term survival in patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer following radical resection.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: In gastrointestinal cancer, the relationship among skeletal muscle, subcutaneous and visceral fat mass, and prognosis is gaining attention. Herein, we developed a body component score (BCS) to comprehensively evaluate total body composition in patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer (CRC) and examined its relationship with long-term prognosis. METHODS: This retrospective study included 300 patients with CRC who underwent curative colorectal resection in 2010-2019. The BCS included skeletal muscle index (SMI), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), visceral fat area (VFA), fatty liver, and pancreatic fatty replacement, measured by preoperative computed tomography. The BCS was calculated as the sum of each score from 0 to 5; patients were grouped into low (score 0-1), medium (score 2-3), and high (score 4-5) BCS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed disease-free (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in these patients. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that T3 or T4 tumors (p = 0.038), pathological stage III (p < 0.001), and low BCS [p = 0.016; hazard ratio (HR), 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-3.35] were independently associated with DFS, whereas pathological stage III (p < 0.001) and low BCS (p = 0.001; HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.57-6.27) were independent prognostic factors for CSS. Patients with a low BCS had significantly worse DFS (p < 0.001) and CSS (p < 0.001), according to the log-rank test for trends. CONCLUSIONS: The BCS may effectively predict prognosis in patients with CRC.",

    "AbstractText": "AIM: To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on short-term outcomes of low anterior resection (LAR) across hospitals classified by surgical volume. METHODS: Data of patients who underwent elective LAR for rectal cancer between 2018 and 2022 were obtained from the National Clinical Database of Japan. Hospitals were categorized into high-, medium-, and low-volume groups. Each group was constituted to represent approximately one-third of all surgeries performed between 2018 and 2019. The standardized morbidity/mortality ratios (SMRs) of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 (CD ≥ 3) complications were the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, and surgical mortality. RESULTS: This study analyzed 91 800 cases of elective LAR, with 10.5% experiencing CD ≥ 3 complications, 8.8% anastomotic leakage, 0.9% pneumonia, and 0.5% surgical mortality. Despite COVID-19, SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications decreased from 2018 to 2022 across all groups. However, increases in the rates and SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications were observed in low-volume hospitals around mid-2020, followed by a decline. Anastomotic leakage showed similar trends. The rates and SMRs of pneumonia and surgical mortality remained unchanged. Notably, anastomotic leakage rates were 7.6%, 8.9%, and 10.0% in high-, medium-, and low-volume hospitals, respectively, indicating superior outcomes in high-volume hospitals. CONCLUSION: Early COVID-19 waves may have disproportionately affected low-volume hospitals. However, the decline in SMRs of CD ≥ 3 complications from 2018 to 2022 across all three groups suggests the robustness and resilience of surgical services for rectal cancer in Japan. The potential disparity in short-term outcomes among hospitals is a new concern.",

    "AbstractText": "AIM: We investigated whether autonomic nervous system resection during robotic rectal surgery contributes to urinary dysfunction and to what extent. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent rectal surgery for primary rectal cancer between December 2011 and April 2021. We identified urinary dysfunction risk factors and examined the effect of autonomic nervous system resection extent on urinary dysfunction occurrence, with urinary dysfunction defined as a residual urine volume of >50 mL. Urinary dysfunction with no improvement over 1 y was defined as permanent urinary dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 1017 eligible patients, 78 (7.7%) required autonomic nervous system resection. Lateral lymph node dissection was performed in 357 patients (35.1%). Urinary dysfunction was observed in 102 patients (10.0%). We studied 32 (41.0%) of 78 patients who underwent autonomic nervous system resection and 82 (23.0%) of 357 patients who underwent lateral lymph node dissection presented with urinary dysfunction. Multivariate analysis revealed that lateral lymph node dissection and autonomic nervous system resection were significant predictors of urinary dysfunction. The urinary dysfunction incidence was notably higher in patients with autonomic nervous system unilateral total resection of at least one side than in those with bilateral preservation (65.4% vs. 28.8%, p < 0.01), and permanent urinary dysfunction exclusively occurred in these patients. CONCLUSION: In robotic surgery, autonomic nervous system resection and lateral lymph node dissection were independent risk factors for urinary dysfunction. Furthermore, the extent of autonomic nervous system resection may increase the risk of permanent urinary dysfunction.",

Although many patients receiving SLC have undergone gastrectomy, the impact of gastrectomy on SLC remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The objective was to evaluate the impact of gastrectomy on SLC for AGC. A total of 290 eligible patients registered in two randomized phase III trials evaluating SLC for patients with AGC was classified into the prior gastrectomy group (PGG; n = 187) or the no gastrectomy group (NGG; n = 103). We compared overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety between these two groups. Adjusted OS and adjusted PFS were estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: The PGG had better performance status (p = 0.001), more prior platinum agent (p < 0.001), and more frequent peritoneal metastasis (p = 0.006) than the NGG. The PGG had significantly better OS (13.8 vs. 9.3 mo; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59; p < 0.001) and PFS (4.7 vs. 2.8 mo; HR: 0.58; p < 0.001) than the NGG.

No significant differences were observed in ORR and DCR. The incidence of Grade 3 or worse adverse events did not differ between the two groups except for a high incidence of anemia and diarrhea in the NGG.

Therefore, the present study examined the effects of skeletal muscle mass on the short- and long-term outcomes of rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 787 Stage I-IV rectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection between 2003 and 2021 at The University of Tokyo Hospital were included. We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis to mitigate confounding bias. The third lumber psoas muscle mass was measured to define sarcopenia. RESULTS: Among 787 patients, 350 (44.5%) were classified as having sarcopenia. After matching, 532 patients were analyzed. Patient characteristics in the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups were similar; however, the body mass index differed. The sarcopenia group had significantly higher rates of postoperative complications of all grades (33.1% vs 24.8%; p = 0.035), of grade ≥2 (29.3% vs 21.8%; p = 0.047), and anastomotic leakage (1.9% vs 0%; p = 0.0082) than the nonsarcopenia group. The 5-y overall survival rate was significantly lower in the sarcopenia group than in the nonsarcopenia group (85.3% vs 91.8%, p = 0.019). Disease-free survival was similar between the groups (p = 0.40). In the total cohort analysis, sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for total postoperative complications (odds ratio 1.41, p = 0.042).

METHODS: A Japanese medical claims database was used to identify patients who had gastroenterological cancer surgery from 2011 to 2022. Patients were divided into groups based on the surgical sites, and postoperative feeding routes and timing of initiation of oral intake for groups were assessed. For the subset of patients fasting postoperatively for ≥7 d, the proportion of patients prescribed target doses of energy (20 kcal/kg) and amino acids (0.8 g/kg) on postoperative d 7 were assessed. RESULTS: Surgical sites of 360 296 study patients were: esophagus, 14 784; stomach, 103 339; colon/rectum, 194 049; liver, 19 277; gallbladder/bile duct, 8279; pancreas, 20 568. The median postoperative day of oral intake initiation was: esophagus, seven; stomach and pancreas, four; colon/rectum and gallbladder/bile duct, three; liver, two. The proportions of fasting patients prescribed target doses of energy and amino acids on postoperative d 7 were: esophagus, 42.6% and 34.4%; stomach, 21.8% and 28.0%; colon/rectum, 20.9% and 29.1%; liver, 21.2% and 22.5%; gallbladder/bile duct, 31.0% and 33.4%; pancreas, 28.2% and 37.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Oral intake after gastroenterological cancer surgery was started earliest in patients undergoing liver surgery and latest in patients undergoing esophageal surgery. Target parenteral energy and amino acid doses were prescribed to less than half of fasting patients. Education is needed to promote early initiation of oral intake and the use of guidelines-based parenteral nutrition dosing in patients after gastroenterological cancer surgery.",

This study aimed to evaluate the combined role of frailty and sarcopenia in predicting postoperative complications in older adults with hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer undergoing surgery. METHODS: This retrospective study included 107 Japanese patients who underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) at the geriatric oncology service before cancer treatment decisions and subsequent curative surgery for hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer. Frailty status was measured using the validated 10-item frailty index based on a CGA (FI-CGA-10) and categorized as fit, prefrail, or frail. Sarcopenia was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and grip strength. The primary outcome was postoperative complications, defined as Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ III, within 1 month of surgery. RESULTS: The median age of the 107 patients was 79 (range, 75-89) years. Patients were categorized as fit (n = 36, 33.7%), prefrail (n = 57, 53.2%), or frail (n = 14, 13.1%). Of these, 21 patients (20%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia; 16 patients (15%) experienced postoperative complications. Patients classified as prefrail or frail had a higher incidence of postoperative complications compared with those classified as fit (19.7% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.08). Patients with both prefrail or frail and sarcopenia had a significantly higher risk of postoperative complications. This association remained significant in the multivariable model (OR 4.74; 95% CI, 1.10-20.29; p = 0.04).

Additionally, the short-term outcomes of MTG compared to open total gastrectomy (OTG) for locally advanced gastric cancer have yet to be demonstrated. METHODS: We retrospectively compared short-term outcomes between MTG and OTG for locally advanced gastric and esophago-gastric junctional cancer, performed at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, during the period from January 2017 to March 2024. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: In total, 359 patients were included, with 190 remaining after PSM, resulting in 95 in each group. The MTG group experienced a significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo classification (C-D) ≥3 than the OTG group (3.2% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.026). Moreover, the rate of postoperative intra-abdominal infectious complications (IAIC) was significantly lower in the MTG than in the OTG group (C-D ≥ 2; 7.4% vs. 17.9%, p = 0.029 and C-D ≥ 3; 2.1% vs. 9.5%, p = 0.030, respectively). Subgroup analyses showed the odds ratios for IAIC with C-D ≥ 2 to be more favorable for the MTG than the OTG group in male patients, those ≥70 years of age, patients without esophageal invasion, those without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those diagnosed with cT≥3, and patients not undergoing combined resection of other organs except for the gallbladder or spleen. CONCLUSIONS: MTG for locally advanced gastric cancer may provide improved short-term outcomes compared to OTG, when performed or supervised by surgeons with high proficiency in laparoscopic techniques.",

METHODS: A total of 1086 patients diagnosed with UAC between 1980 and 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Data were collected through the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum project. The patients were divided into two groups: 248 elderly patients in the E-UAC group and 838 nonelderly patients in the NE-UAC group. Patients aged >65 y at cancer diagnosis were considered elderly. RESULTS: The recurrence rate did not differ between the two groups. Segmental resection was the only common independent risk factor for recurrence in both the E-UAC and the NE-UAC groups. The E-UAC patients had significantly better 5-y disease-specific survival (DSS) than the NE-UAC patients (94.7% vs 91.0%, p = 0.04).

The E-UAC patients who underwent segmental resection had poorer RFS than those who underwent total proctocolectomy, but there were no significant differences in DSS or OS. CONCLUSION: Despite the elevated risk of cancer recurrence observed in the UAC patients who underwent segmental resection in both the E-UAC the NE-UAC groups, our findings suggested that segmental resection may be a viable alternative to total proctocolectomy in terms of survival rate for the E-UAC patients.",

However, it remains unclear whether surgical volumes and medical resource use have recovered postpandemic. This study examines pre- and postpandemic trends in upper gastrointestinal surgeries, including esophagectomy and gastrectomy, and their short-term outcomes. METHODS: Data from the Japan's National Clinical Database (NCD) were analyzed for patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer and gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2018 and December 2023. We evaluated changes in surgical volume, intensive care unit (ICU) use, morbidity, mortality rates, and the standardized morbidity and mortality ratio (SMR)-a comparison of observed versus expected outcomes using an NCD-established risk calculator. Key metrics included 30d mortality, surgical mortality, and four major morbidities like pneumonia and anastomotic leakage. RESULTS: Esophagectomy volumes remained stable from 2018 to 2023, while gastrectomy volumes decreased notably over the past 6 y. The proportion of patients over 70 increased significantly in both surgery types. Morbidity and mortality rates showed no significant deterioration postpandemic, as indicated by SMR values.

Patients with severe urinary incontinence are most commonly treated with artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) placement. AIM: To evaluate the functional results of AUS implantation in patients with severe urinary incontinence at long-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2023, the AUS was implanted in 62 patients with severe stress urinary incontinence. Urinary losses were assessed using a bladder diary. No need to use pads or use of no more than 1 safety pad per day (\"social continence\") was considered a success, while use of no more than 2 pads, or a reduction in urine loss of more than 50% was regarded as an improvement. RESULTS: The mean patient age at the time of AUS implantation was 67.4+/-8 years. Urinary incontinence was most often a complication of radical prostatectomy (61.3%). A history of radiation therapy, previous treatment of urethral stricture, and surgical procedures for urinary incontinence were noted in 14.5%, 48.4%, and 19.4% of patients, respectively. The median follow-up was 73.5 months (IQR 14.8-118.3 months). There was a significant decrease in median urine loss from 900 mL (IQR 700-1100 mL) to 7 mL (IQR 0-35 mL; p<0.05), and a decrease in the number of pads used per day from 7 (IQR 6-8) to 1 (IQR 0-2; p<0.05). The criterion for successful implantation was met in 69.4% of patients, while 43.5% of patients did not use pads. According to the correlation analysis, concomitant diabetes mellitus, history of radiation therapy, surgical treatment of the urethral stricture or urinary incontinence did not have any significant effect on functional results. In addition, there were no cases of AUS revision. CONCLUSIONS: AUS placement in patients with severe stress urinary incontinence allows to achieve satisfactory functional results during long-term follow-up.",

Questionnaires allow to evaluate sexual function in men during the last month before the treatment. At the same time, the sexual life of a man who has developed PCa is still not studied. The experience of assessing the sexual constitution of men with newly diagnosed PCa is presented in the article. AIM: To determine male sexuality from its first manifestations to the moment of PCa diagnosis, i.e. throughout the entire period of sexual activity, as well as to evaluate the relationship between sexuality and serum testosterone levels at the time of PCa diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 87 patients aged 47-75 years diagnosed with PCa pf T1C-3bN0-1M0-1a, who independently answered the questions of the questionnaire \"Integral assessment of male sexuality\" (2009), were included in the study. All men underwent an examination for serum total testosterone. RESULTS: From the whole cohort, 90.8% of men were defined as hyposexual, and 9.2% had normal sexuality. Weak sexual constitution was found throughout the entire period of sexual life, but by the time of PCa diagnosis, it was even lower. 70.1% of patients had a total testosterone deficiency at the time of PCa detection. No reliable relationship was found between the reduced and normal sexual constitution and serum testosterone levels. CONCLUSION: Most men with PCa have low sexual activity throughout their lives, a high incidence of testosterone deficiency at the time of cancer diagnosis. In addition, there is no relationship between serum testosterone levels and male sexuality.",

AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficiency of PCA of RCC (cT1a) under ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) guidance, as well as overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After receiving approval from the local ethics committee, a total of 59 patients with RCC was undergone to PCI at the Institute of Urology and Human Reproductive Health of the First Moscow State Medical University named after I.M. Sechenov. In the period from 2015 to 2017, PCI under ultrasound guidance was performed in 27 patients. The average age of the patients was 66 years (48-83), the average tumor size was 29 mm (14-36). The Charlson comorbidity index was 7 (5-10). In the period from 2018 to 2022, PCI for RCC was performed in 32 patients. The average age was 68 years (46-89), while the average tumor size was 24 mm (8-38). The Charlson comorbidity index was 7 (4-12). The study included patients with histologically confirmed RCC with a tumor size of up to 4 cm. RESULTS: There were four recurrences diagnosed by ultrasound. Two patients underwent repeated PCI, while in the remaining cases laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was done. Six-year overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival was 96%, 85% and 100%, respectively. On CT, four relapses were diagnosed. Repeat PCI was done in two patients, and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed in other two cases. In one patient, intraoperative bleeding was noted during the insertion of cryoneedles, due to which the procedure was aborted. Bleeding was stopped conservatively. Three- overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival was 97%, 88% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PCI under ultrasound and CT guidance showed comparable efficacy in the treatment of RCC, however, to reduce the radiation dose, it is reasonable to use a combination of imaging methods.",

    "AbstractText": "AIM: to explore the development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on deep learning (DL) neural networks aimed at minimizing human error in PI-RADS grading and supporting medical decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included a cohort of 136 patients, comprising 108 cases of PCa (PI-RADS score 4-5) and 28 cases of benign conditions (PI-RADS score 1-2). The 3D U-Net architecture was applied to process T2-weighted images (T2W), diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced images (DCE). Statistical analysis was conducted using Python libraries to assess diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, Dice similarity coefficients, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The DL-CAD system achieved an average accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 60%, and specificity of 84% for detecting lesions in the prostate. The Dice similarity coefficient for prostate segmentation was 0.71, and the AUC was 81.16%. The system demonstrated high specificity in reducing false-positive results, which, after further optimization, could help minimize unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment. CONCLUSION: The DL-CAD system shows potential in supporting clinical decision-making for patients with clinically significant PCa by improving diagnostic accuracy, particularly in minimizing intra- and inter-observer variability. Despite its high specificity, improvements in sensitivity and segmentation accuracy are needed, which could be achieved by using larger datasets and advanced deep learning techniques. Further multicenter validation is required for accelerated integration of this system into clinical practice.",

    "AbstractText": "This case study demonstrates a single-position supine approach for robotic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (R-RPLDN) for the treatment of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and residual masses after chemotherapy. We performed a bilateral R-RPLDN in a 33-year-old man with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and residual postchemotherapy masses. For this approach, the patient was placed in a steep Trendelenburg position, and a 5-port transperitoneal technique was used, with the robot docked so that the arms were oriented cephalad. This approach allowed simultaneous access to both sides of the retroperitoneum, thereby eliminating the need for bilateral lymphadenectomy and patient repositioning. Bilateral R-RPLDN was performed using a single-position supine approach. This versatile approach offers a less invasive, more efficient, and safer solution for removing residual postchemotherapy testicular cancer masses.",

    "AbstractText": "Penile cancer accounts for about 1% of all male cancer diagnoses in the United States. Regional lymph node involvement is strongly correlated with overall outcomes, and as such the procedure of inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) is imperative to the diagnostic and oncologic outcomes for these patients. The current gold standard of open ILND presents challenges in mitigating detrimental postoperative sequalae such as wound complications and lymphedema, without compromising oncologic outcomes. There has been a growing interest and shift in minimally invasive (MIS) approaches to tackle the challenges seen in the open approach to ILND. Several different minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopic video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (VEIL) and robotic-assisted VEIL approaches have been explored and described in the literature. A systematic literature search of PubMed and Medline (OVID) literature review was performed to assess outcomes in MIS approaches to ILND in comparison to traditional open approach. Key words included penile cancer/penile neoplasms, minimally-invasive procedures, robotics, video-endoscopic, robotic-assisted, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and inguinal lymph node dissections. Studies show that MIS approaches to ILND have potential to reduce high-grade postoperative complications, operative time, and hospital stay while ensuring oncologic outcomes. Despite the learning curve associated with MIS ILND, preliminary data does suggest favorable outcomes. Prospective, randomized trials are needed to reveal the full benefit of MIS ILND compared to open ILND.",

Understanding the regulatory landscape governing their approval is crucial as their development accelerates. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of recent patents, regulatory considerations, emerging concerns, and future perspectives of PROTACs in cancer management. EXPERT OPINION: From a regulatory perspective, PROTACs present unique challenges and opportunities. Their dual-functional nature requires a nuanced approach to classification and approval, blending small-molecule and biologic regulatory frameworks. Specific guidelines addressing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are needed. Comprehensive preclinical evaluation and robust clinical trial designs are essential to manage off-target effects and immunogenic responses. The collaboration between regulatory bodies, academia, and industry is crucial for establishing a clear pathway for PROTAC approval.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer, next to cardiovascular diseases, remains the primary concern of modern medicine in developed countries. Despite the unprecedented progress in targeted therapies and personalised medicine, including immunotherapy and gene therapy, we are still unable to efficiently treat many malignancies. One of the major obstacles to treating cancer is its ability to metastasise. Hence, a better understanding of cancer biology with emphasis on the metastasis formation may hold the key to further ameliorating cancer treatment. Nowadays, there is a growing body of evidence for the common denominator of neoplasia, which seems to be universal - cancer stem cells which are being found in a growing number of cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a Web of Science and Medline database search using the terms \"cancer stem cells\", \"carcinogenesis\", and \"stem cells\" in conjunction with \"metastasis\", without setting time limits. RESULTS: The existence of cancer stem cells was proven both in animal models and in humans. We know beyond doubt that cancer stem cells may be found in bladder cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer, among others. The cancer stem cells in the aforementioned cancers may initiate tumour formation ex vivo and thus theoretically lead to tumour recurrence. Their role in the formation of metastases, however, is still under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Although their exact role is yet to be identified, it is now obvious that cancer stem cells give rise to primary mass in solid tumours and differentiated cancer cells in leukaemias. However, the role of cancer stem cells in metastasis is still obscure.",

Moreover, the impact of these complications is not well qualified. The primary purpose of this study is to qualify complications after RC and quantify rates of emergency department (ED) utilisation and readmissions to the hospital. The secondary purpose is to associate risk factors for ED visits and hospital readmission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were retrospectively analysed, who underwent RC for bladder cancer. ED visits within 90 days of discharge from RC and readmission at both 30 and 31-90 days of discharge were collected. Complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo system and classified using the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center complication system. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-six patients were included. The in-house complication rate before discharge was 36%, and the 90-day complication rate after discharge was 54.8%. 33.7% of patients had ≥1 ED visit postoperatively, 18.7% were readmitted within 30 days, and 17.3% within 31-90 days of discharge. The primary reason for ED presentation, readmission at 30 and 31-90 days was infection. Cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) was associated with greater likelihood of presentation to the ED and readmission 31-90 days postoperatively (p <0.01). Overall survival (OS) was worse in patients who presented to the ED and/or were readmitted at both the 30- and 31-90-day marks (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ED utilisation and readmission rates after RC are high. The most common complication is infection. Patients with a CU are at higher risk for healthcare utilisation. OS is worse in patients with an ED visit or readmission to the hospital, and these patients may require closer monitoring.",

    "AbstractText": "Lung cancer is responsible for highest mortality rates among both men and women globally. There is a need of effective and safe treatment modality that specifically targets cancer cells and doesn't not harm healthy cells. Procyanidolic oligomers (PCOs) is a natural antioxidant found in grape seed, acts as medicament for the treatment of various disease which are linked with oxidative stress specifically cancer. The aim of the current study was to synthesize highly stable gliadin encapsulated PCOs nanoformulation (PCO-NF). The PCOs nanoformulation (PCO-NF) showed spherical morphology (17.18-76.56 nm) with an average particle size 49.37 ± 22.17 nm diameter in electron microscopy and stable zeta potential i.e. - 23.1 mV and low polydispersity index i.e. 0.246 in dynamic light scattering (DLS). The therapeutic efficacy of PCO-NF has been evaluated through antioxidative, anticancer as well as antimicrobial studies. Antioxidant potency was assessed using DPPH scavenging assay and it was observed that IC50 of PCO-NF (9.02 µg/ml) was even lower than that of Vitamin C (10.22 µg/ml) as well as pure PCOs. The MTT assay was performed for the comparative anticancer activity of pure PCOs and PCO-NF against SK-MES-1 lung cancer cell line. It was found that PCO-NF significantly inhibited the lung cancer cells at all tested concentration. Moreover at 125 µg/ml concentration the PCO-NF showed 31.54% cell viability which was even lesser than the standard anticancer drug. The antimicrobial efficacy of PCO-NF was assessed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Point-of-care devices that can be utilized for mass screening of the population may improve patient survival through early diagnosis. In this context, we report an ultrasensitive DNA-based nano-biosensor for the quantification of cancer biomarker miRNA-21 using a label-free sensing technique. Magnetite selenium (  Fe 3 O 4 - Se  ) nanocomposite was prepared by co-precipitation method followed by characterization using TEM, EDX, FTIR, VSM, and XRD. The average size of the nanomaterial was found to be 20 nm with a low polydispersity index of 0.2. The biosensor was fabricated by immobilizing a single-stranded DNA probe specific to miRNA-21 onto the  Fe 3 O 4 - Se  nanocomposite modified electrode surface. At the working electrode/electrolyte interface, the binding of the DNA probe results in decreased charge transfer impedance. The developed magnetite-based impedimetric biosensor demonstrated a linear variation of resistance to charge transfer with miRNA-21 concentration (75 zM to 0.751 pM). The ultrasensitive low limits of detection (75 zM), the sensitivity of 1774.34 Ω / μ g/ μ L/ cm 2  and high selectivity over other biomarkers (miRNAs-miRNA-30e, miRNA-143, miRNA-204, DNA, protein, and cocktail of all makes it suitable for early diagnosis.

Here, we discovered that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) rewired glucose metabolism from glycolysis to PPP in breast cancer (BC) cells by activating G6PD to keep intracellular redox homeostasis under oxidative stress. Mechanistically, CDK5-phosphorylated G6PD at Thr-91 facilitated the assembly of inactive monomers of G6PD into active dimers. More importantly, CDK5-induced pho-G6PD was explicitly observed specifically in tumor tissues in human BC specimens. Pharmacological inhibition of CDK5 remarkably abrogated G6PD phosphorylation, attenuated tumor growth and metastasis, and synergistically sensitized BC cells to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor Olaparib, in xenograft mouse models.

Aiming at them, a lipid-based pharmaceutical loaded with CaO2 and glucose oxidase (GOx) (LipoCaO2/GOx, LCG) has been obtained to disrupt calcium homeostasis and interfere with glycometabolism. The loaded GOx can decompose glucose into H2O2 and gluconic acid, thus competing with anaerobic glycolysis to hamper lactic acid (LA) secretion. The obtained gluconic acid further deprives CaO2 to produce H2O2 and release Ca2+, disrupting Ca2+ homeostasis, which synergizes with GOx-mediated glycometabolism interference to deplete glutathione (GSH) and yield reactive oxygen species (ROS). Systematical experiments reveal that these sequential multifaceted events unlocked by Ca2+ homeostasis disruption and glycometabolism interference, ROS production and LA inhibition, successfully enhance cancer immunogenic deaths of breast cancer cells, hamper regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltration and promote CD8+ T recruitment, which receives a considerably-inhibited outcome against breast cancer progression.

Consequently, a nanoformulation containing metal sulfide of FeS and GSDMD plasmid (NPFeS/GD) had been developed to effectively augment antitumor immune responses through dual activation of immunogenic PANoptosis and ferroptosis, as well as reprogramming immunosuppressive effects via H2S amplification. The bioactive NPFeS/GD exhibited controlled release of GSDMD plasmid, H2S, and Fe2+ in response to the tumor microenvironment. Fe2+, H2S, and the expression of GSDMD protein could effectively elicit highly immunogenic PANoptosis and ferroptosis. Furthermore, releasing H2S could mitigate the overexpression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase1 (IDO1) induced by immunogenic PANoptotic and ferroptotic cell death and disrupt the activity of IDO1. Consequently, NPFeS/GD effectively triggered the antitumor innate and adaptive immune responses through induction of PANoptotic and ferroptotic cell death and reshaped the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to enhance antitumor immunotherapy for metastasis inhibition. This study unveiled the significant potential of immunogenic PANoptosis and ferroptosis in H2S gas therapy for enhancing tumor immunotherapy, offering novel insights and ideas for the rational design of nanomedicine to enhance tumor immunogenicity while reprogramming the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

    "AbstractText": "Although cancer immunotherapy has made great strides in the clinic, it is still hindered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway which can modulate TIME effectively has emerged as a promising therapeutic recently. However, the delivery of most STING agonists, specifically cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), is performed intratumorally due to their insufficient pharmacological properties, such as weak permeability across cell membranes and vulnerability to nuclease degradation. To expand the clinical applicability of CDNs, a novel pH-sensitive polycationic polymer-modified lipid nanoparticle (LNP-B) system was developed for intravenous delivery of CDNs. LNP-B significantly extended the circulation of CDNs and enhanced the accumulation of CDNs within the tumor, spleen, and tumor-draining lymph nodes compared with free CDNs thereby triggering the STING pathway of dendritic cells and repolarizing pro-tumor macrophages. These events subsequently gave rise to potent anti-tumor immune reactions and substantial inhibition of tumors in CT26 colon cancer-bearing mouse models. In addition, due to the acid-sensitive property of the polycationic polymer, the delivery system of LNP-B was more biocompatible and safer compared with lipid nanoparticles formulated with an indissociable cationic DOTAP (LNP-D). These findings suggest that LNP-B has great potential in the intravenous delivery of CDNs for tumor immunotherapy.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. While cigarette smoking is the major preventable factor for cancers in general and lung cancer in particular, old age is also a major risk factor. Aging-related chronic, low-level inflammation, termed inflammaging, has been widely documented; however, it remains unclear how inflammaging contributes to increased lung cancer incidence. AIM: The aim of this study was to establish connections between aging-associated changes in the lungs and cancer risk. METHODS: We analyzed public databases of gene expression for normal and cancerous human lungs and used mouse models to understand which changes were dependent on inflammation, as well as to assess the impact on oncogenesis. RESULTS: Analyses of GTEx and TCGA databases comparing gene expression profiles from normal lungs, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma of subjects across age groups revealed upregulated pathways such as inflammatory response, TNFA signaling via NFκB, and interferon-gamma response. Similar pathways were identified comparing the gene expression profiles of young and old mouse lungs. Transgenic expression of alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) partially reverses increases in markers of aging-associated inflammation and immune deregulation. Using an orthotopic model of lung cancer using cells derived from EML4-ALK fusion-induced adenomas, we demonstrated an increased tumor outgrowth in lungs of old mice while NLRP3 knockout in old mice decreased tumor volumes, suggesting that inflammation contributes to increased lung cancer development in aging organisms. CONCLUSIONS: These studies reveal how expression of an anti-inflammatory mediator (AAT) can reduce some but not all aging-associated changes in mRNA and protein expression in the lungs. We further show that aging is associated with increased tumor outgrowth in the lungs, which may relate to an increased inflammatory microenvironment.",

    "AbstractText": "As local regions in the tumor outstrip their oxygen supply, hypoxia can develop, affecting not only the cancer cells, but also other cells in the microenvironment, including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Hypoxia is also not necessarily stable over time, and can fluctuate or oscillate. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 is the master regulator of cellular response to hypoxia, and can also exhibit oscillations in its activity. To understand how stable, and fluctuating hypoxia influence breast CAFs, we measured changes in gene expression in CAFs in normoxia, hypoxia, and oscillatory hypoxia, as well as measured change in their capacity to resist, or assist breast cancer invasion. We show that hypoxia has a profound effect on breast CAFs causing activation of key pathways associated with fibroblast activation, but reduce myofibroblast activation and traction force generation. We also found that oscillatory hypoxia, while expectedly resulted in a \"sub-hypoxic\" response in gene expression, it resulted in specific activation of pathways associated with actin polymerization and actomyosin maturation. Using traction force microscopy, and a nanopatterned stromal invasion assay, we show that oscillatory hypoxia increases contractile force generation vs stable hypoxia, and increases heterogeneity in force generation response, while also additively enhancing invasibility of CAFs to MDA-MB-231 invasion. Our data show that stable and unstable hypoxia can regulate many mechnobiological characteristics of CAFs, and can contribute to transformation of CAFs to assist cancer dissemination and onset of metastasis.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women, and its incidence is increasing in Iran. HER-2-positive breast cancer is invasive and often associated with poorer outcomes. Patients with this type of breast cancer can develop resistance to medications like trastuzumab. Trastuzumab-emtansine (TDM1) is a medication developed to reduce cancer cell resistance to trastuzumab. The TDM1 has been shown to decrease the incidence of death and recurrence in breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and calculate the budget impact of TDM1 versus trastuzumab for the treatment of residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer. METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed, incorporating four health states. Women aged 45 with residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer entered the model. The study adopted a healthcare system perspective, with costs reported in 2021 US dollars. Discount rates of 7% for costs and 3% for utility values were applied. Utility values and transition probabilities were derived from published literature. Costs were estimated based on guidelines, expert opinions, and Iranian tariffs. Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold of 1085$ was used for comparison. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and budget impact of TDM1 were calculated, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The model indicated that treatment with TDM1 resulted in a 1.59 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) increase, with an additional cost of 1408$. This was deemed cost-effective, considering Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold of 1085$ (calculated ICER: 886$ per QALY gained). One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the model was sensitive to the costs of TDM1 and trastuzumab, the discount rates for utility values and costs, and the probability of achieving invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 59.61% of simulations fell below Iran's pharmacoeconomic threshold, supporting the model's robustness. The budget impact analysis revealed that the additional budget required for TDM1 treatment over a three-year period was 1,120,546$ compared to trastuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: Although TDM1 imposes higher costs, it is more cost-effective than trastuzumab for the treatment of residual invasive HER-2-positive breast cancer in Iran.",

Although discoveries related to the potential anticancer effects of bee venom are increasing, the unstable nature of venom biomolecules remains a limiting factor for their usage. In this study, we employed mesoporous silica nanocarriers (MSNs) to provide precise dosing and prevent carriers from biomolecule degradation thanks to the outstanding loading capacity provided by the pores, excellent chemical and biological robustness, and ability to improve bioavailability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSNs were synthesized and physicochemical characterizations were carried out. The cytotoxicity of Apis mellifera anatoliaca bee venom and venom-complexed MSNs (MSNs@Venom) were determined for the MDA-MB 231, PC3, and HeLa cancer cell lines and the cytotoxicity of pristine MSNs was investigated for the HEK-293 and CCD34-Lu cell lines. The cellular uptake of MSNs@Venom by PC3 and MDA-MB 231 cells was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The apoptotic effect on cancer cells was examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The MSNs exhibited significant cellular uptake of MSN by the PC3 and MDA-MB 231 cell lines, resulting in a 1.5-fold enhancement in the apoptotic effect of venom on the PC3 cell line when combined with MSNs, compared to cells exposed alone to venom. CONCLUSION: MSNs could effectively be taken up by MDA-MB 231 and PC3 cancer cells, enhancing the action of bee venom by the particle-mediated delivery. MSNs@Venom have the potential to offer cost-effective complementary and innovative cancer treatment options.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Health care provider (HCP) implicit bias can impact health outcomes for youth with sickle cell disease (SCD). AIMS: : The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an individuation and perspective-taking (IPT) intervention to decrease implicit bias and improve pain treatment clinical decision making in pediatric SCD HCPs. METHODS: This mixed methods pilot randomly assigned HCPs (N = 36) to an intervention (n = 17) or control condition (n = 19). Implicit and explicit bias measures were administered pretreatment and 3 months postintervention. Differences were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance. HCP ratings of virtual patient vignettes depicting Black and White youth with SCD or cancer pain were used to assess differential clinical decision making based on race and diagnosis and analyzed using hierarchical linear mixed model analysis. Focus groups with intervention participants were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences in scores on bias measures across time, condition, or the Condition × Time interaction were found (all P < 0.05). Significant differences in HCP ratings were found between types of HCPs (P < 0.001), but no effects were attributable to condition, time, virtual patient race, or diagnosis. Ten themes were extracted regarding the intervention's format, structure, and content. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate an IPT intervention in pediatric SCD HCPs. HCPs deemed the intervention feasible, acceptable, and impactful and suggested areas for improvement. Future research should refine the intervention to incorporate greater patient involvement and skills practice to improve health outcomes for this underserved population.",

    "AbstractText": "Breast cancer subtypes can be categorized based on their gene expression profiles using immunohistochemistry into Luminal A, Luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. However, immunohistochemistry has certain limitations that can lead to misclassification. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification, and changes in the promoter region can alter gene expression and the quantity of functional protein synthesized, disrupting gene function. The aim of this study was to identify DNA methylation biomarkers for subtype classification in breast cancer using microarray and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) methods. DNA samples were extracted, subjected to bisulfite conversion and then used for both the microarray and MSP methods. This study successfully identified differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) as biomarker for each subtype classification of breast cancer: Luminal A (hypermethylation of ADAMTSL2 gene; cg14397888), Luminal B (hypomethylation of ADAMTSL2 gene; cg14397888), HER2+ (hypermethylation of PTPRN2 gene; cg25910261), and TNBC (hypomethylation of LCLATl gene; cg15652532). The DMC biomarker found for the HER2+ subtype, hypermethylation in the PTPRN2 gene (cg25910261), has the potential to be used by healthcare providers to identify HER2+ patients and provide the HER2-targeted therapy to improve the patient's survival. In addition, our developed MSP method could produce an effective diagnostic tool for classifying the Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes, with accuracies of 75% and 76%, respectively.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The relationship between social support, coping strategies, spirituality, and psychological well-being in breast cancer survivors is crucial in psycho-oncology. Survivors face complex challenges, and the interplay of these factors affects their recovery. Social support, encompassing emotional, informational, and practical assistance, is pivotal, offering belonging and resilience. Coping strategies, whether adaptive (like problemsolving) or maladaptive (like denial), significantly impact psychological outcomes. Spirituality, irrespective of ties to organized religion, significantly impacts the psychological well-being of breast cancer survivors. It provides a framework for understanding and coping, offering hope and meaning. Psychological status encompasses emotional well-being, mental health, and quality of life, influenced by cancer severity, personality traits, social support, coping strategies, and fear of recurrence. Methodology for literature review: The literature review employed a systematic approach, utilizing various databases and search terms to identify recent research on the relationship between social support, coping strategies, spirituality, and psychological status among breast cancer survivors. Inclusion criteria focused on relevance and rigor, with a thematic emphasis on the interplay between these factors. Both qualitative and quantitative studies from peer-reviewed journals were considered within a specific time frame (2010-2023) to capture recent advancements. The screening process involved two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. Data extraction and synthesis involved carefully analyzing study characteristics, key findings, and implications for survivorship. The analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview and identify future research directions. CONCLUSION: Understanding the dynamics of social support, coping strategies, spirituality and psychological status among breast cancer survivors is essential for developing effective interventions and support systems. By addressing and challenging societal attitudes, promoting awareness and education, and fostering supportive environments, Healthcare professionals can help breast cancer survivors overcome they face, enhance their coping mechanisms, bolster their social support networks, and ultimately improve their psychological status.",

    "AbstractText": "Aim & Objectives: Although NCRT (Neoadjuvant Chemo Radiation Therapy) followed by surgery demonstrates an increase in overall survival (OS) in locally advanced operable esophageal cancer, there is a lack of a reliable predictive factor to identify patients who are more likely to be affected by treatment toxicities or natural history of the disease. In this study, we have studied various indices like pre-treatment serum albumin, hemoglobin, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), Platelet to Albumin Ratio (PAR), Systemic Immune Index (SII) as independent prognostic factors in esophageal cancer, with respect to the outcomes and tumor response. Material & Methods: A total of 83 patients of esophageal cancer who were treated with Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation from 2016-2021 were evaluated in this study. All the patients were treated with 41.4 Gy / 23 # External Beam Radiation Therapy with concurrent weekly Paclitaxel & Carboplatin (CROSS Protocol). Baseline hematological parameters like PLR, NLR, PAR, SII, Serum Albumin and Hemoglobin were obtained from laboratory records. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Chi square test was used to analyze the association with pathological complete response after NCRT. Results: The median follow-up time of the study was 42.50 months, and the median age of patients was 55 years (IQR - 45-63). The majority of the patients were squamous cell carcinoma (92.8%), and 7.2% of the patients were adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Amongst this study group, 41 patients (49.4%) underwent surgery following chemoradiation, the rest of the patients couldn't undergo surgery. Amongst the 41 operated patients, 21 (51.2%) had pathological complete response, 13 (31.7%) had partial response, 7 (17.1%) had poor/no response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The median OS of a group of patients who underwent surgery (44.7 Months) was found to be significantly higher (p<0.001) than that of patients who were not operated (17.8 Months). Kaplan Meir analysis and log-rank test revealed that high pretreatment albumin and hemoglobin had statistically significant association with better OS. High PLR, low NLR, low PAR and high SII had a correlation trend with better OS. However, statistical significance couldn't be demonstrated owing to our smaller sample size. Patients with high PLR (> 180) were found to have a higher rate of pathologic complete response compared to the patients with low PLR (< 180). Conclusion: NCRT when offered to a selected subgroup of patients having operable carcinoma esophagus can give excellent survival outcomes. Patient selection should incorporate factors that look into the biology, systemic inflammatory response and baseline status of these patients. The evaluation of these factors on a larger scale prospective multicentric trials is warranted.",

AIM: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the immunoexpression and interrelationship of cyclin D1 (CD1) and HER2/neu in histopathologically diagnosed cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC) and its association with other clinicopathological parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 120 cases of cervical lesions; out of which 10 cases were of negative for malignancy/dysplasia (NED), 15 cases of CIN I, 9 cases of CIN II and 21 cases of CIN III and 65 cases of invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC). A technique of manual tissue array was employed to study the expression pattern of CD1 and HER2/neu in all the cases. Results were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: CD1 immunoexpression was statistically significantly higher in normal + LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) (CIN I) cases than HSIL (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) (CIN II+III) + ICC. As the severity of the cervical lesions increased, CD1 immunoexpression statistically significantly shifted from nucleus to cytoplasm. Statistically significant inverse relationship was noted between CD1 expression and grade of ICC cases. CD1 IHC marker showed 63.64% sensitivity, 0% specificity, 87.5% PPV and 0% NPV. The overall agreement of CD1 staining with H&E diagnosis was 58.33% (κ=0.1538 i.e. poor). HER2/neu immunoexpression increased statistically significantly with increasing severity of lesion from CIN-I to CIN-III to ICC. None of the NED cases in present study showed HER2/neu positivity. With increasing stage and grade of ICC, the percentage of cases expressing HER2/neu statistically significantly increased. Her2/neu IHC marker showed 56.63% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV and 17.24% NPV. The overall agreement of HER2/ neu staining with H&E diagnosis was 60% (κ=0.1771 i.e. poor). The agreement between HER2/neu and CD1 immunostaining was 40%. CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 and HER2/neu IHC marker panel could be used as prognostic markers and could be routinely incorporated into the surgical pathology report which could aid in understanding the biology of the tumor and better patient management.

The present retrospective cohort study examines clinical characteristics, prevalence, and mortality risk across alcoholic intake spectrum in SLD individuals. METHODS: Data between 1999 to 2018 were extracted from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey registries and analysed. Population baseline characteristics were evaluated across classifications of SLD. SLD was confirmed using either fatty liver index (FLI) or United States FLI (US-FLI). Multivariate analyses were used to study mortality-related outcomes. RESULTS: The 20,510 individuals with SLD included were classified into MASLD predominant (69.00%), MetALD (18.77%), and ALD predominant (12.23%) groups. Temporal analysis revealed significant decreases in MASLD prevalence in the SLD population from 1999-2018 in general [average annual percentage change (AAPC) -4.802%, P=0.001], as well as in females, Mexican Americans, and Non-Hispanic Blacks. MetALD prevalence in the SLD population increased from 1999-2018 in general (AAPC +1.635%, P<0.001), and in males, females, Mexican Americans, Non-Hispanic Blacks and other ethnicities. No significant change in ALD prevalence was found. Compared to MASLD predominant individuals, ALD predominant individuals had higher risks of all-cause [hazard ratio (HR): 1.189, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.026 to 1.378, P=0.02] and cancer-related mortality (subdistribution HR: 1.277, 95% CI: 1.032 to 1.579, P=0.02). No significant difference was observed for all-cause, cancer-related, or cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality in MetALD and CVD-related mortality in ALD predominant individuals, relative to MASLD predominant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: ALD predominant patients have higher all-cause and cancer-related mortality risks than MASLD predominant patients but not CVD-related mortality. SLD is highly heterogeneous in clinical characteristics, prevalence, and mortality risks which healthcare professionals must account for to avert adverse health outcomes.",

The current research aims to address the extent of delay in presentation to the hospital and the factors that contribute to delayed presentation among breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 138 primary breast cancer patients aged 18 to 60 years, with a time lag of more than 2 weeks between the initial recognition of symptoms and the first medical interaction. These patients were attending the oncology Outpatient Department (OPD) of tertiary care center in Central India, where female breast cancer patients receive treatment and follow-up care. The analysis employed binary logistic regression to assess the factors significantly affecting the delayed presentation to the hospital. RESULTS: Most of the participants were aged between 40 and 50 years and did not have a family history of breast cancer. The median delay in presentation to the hospital was 2 months. Women having breast lump as initial breast symptom tend to present late (> 3 months) to the hospital (p=0.037) and if the breast lump was smaller, they are more likely to delay seeking medical attention compared to those with larger breast lump (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: The study indicates that many patients delayed seeking help due to small breast lumps. Improved screening services are needed for early detection. Future awareness campaigns should emphasize the link between breast lumps and cancer to reduce delays and improve patient quality of life.",

    "AbstractText": "The Zika virus has been shown to infect glioblastoma stem cells via the membrane receptor  α v β 5   , which is activated by the stem-specific transcription factor SOX2. Since the expression level of SOX2 is an important predictive marker for successful virotherapy, it is important to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the role of SOX2 in the dynamics of cancer stem cells and Zika viruses. In this paper, we develop a mathematical ODE model to investigate the effects of SOX2 expression levels on Zika virotherapy against glioblastoma stem cells. Our study aimed to identify the conditions under which SOX2 expression level, viral infection, and replication can reduce or eradicate the glioblastoma stem cells. Analytic work on the existence and stability conditions of equilibrium points with respect to the basic reproduction number are provided. Numerical results were in good agreement with analytic solutions. Our results show that critical threshold levels of both SOX2 and viral replication, which change the stability of equilibrium points through population dynamics such as transcritical and Hopf bifurcations, were observed. These critical thresholds provide the optimal conditions for SOX2 expression levels and viral bursting sizes to enhance therapeutic efficacy of Zika virotherapy against glioblastoma stem cells. This study provides critical insights into optimizing Zika virus-based treatment for glioblastoma by highlighting the essential role of SOX2 in viral infection and replication.",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data of 95,444 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer between 2010 and 2017 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT), and surgery alone was compared in patients with stage II esophageal cancer. Patients with stage III disease were divided into \"local invasive type\" group (type I, T3N1M0, T4N0-1M0) and \"regional metastatic type\" group (type II, T1-2N2-3M0) according to the tumor invasion pattern. The effectiveness of nCRT and nCT in different patterns was compared. RESULTS: In 2,706 patients with stage II disease, a statistical difference was observed in the overall survival (OS) between nCRT (85.1%), nCT (3.0%), and surgery alone (11.9%, P<0.001, median OS (mOS): 54 vs 41 vs 24 months). Meanwhile, 3,303 patients with stage III disease who received nCRT were included in the propensity score matching. A statistical difference was observed in the OS between \"Type I\" (n = 217) and \"Type II\" (n = 217, P = 0.023, mOS: 45 VS 28 months). Among 93 patients with stage III receiving nCT, those with \"Type II\" (23.7%) showed a greater potential benefit from nCT than those with \"Type I\" (76.3%, P = 0.686, mOS: 51 vs 40 months). CONCLUSIONS: nCRT is recommended for stage II esophageal cancer. In patients with stage III, those with \"local invasive type\" may greatly benefit from nCRT, while those with \"regional metastatic type\" may greatly benefit from nCT.",

    "AbstractText": "A 47-year-old woman underwent [18F]-FDG and [18F]-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT to assess the staging of suspected axillary lymph node enlargement following breast-conserving surgery. The imaging with these two PET agents revealed starkly contrasting results. Significant [18F]-FDG uptake in the right axillary fossa, intrathoracic muscles, and clavicle lymph nodes led nuclear medicine physicians to suspect metastasis. However, no uptake of [18F]-NOTA-FAPI-04 was observed. Subsequently, the patient underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the enlarged axillary lymph nodes, which pathologically confirmed the diagnosis as inflammation. After a multidisciplinary discussion, the patient received radiotherapy for the right breast and 2.15Gy/F×28F for the tumor bed. She was discharged following the completion of her radiotherapy. Accurate diagnosis and staging are pivotal in selecting the optimal clinical treatment for breast cancer patients. Notably, [18F]-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT downgraded this patient's staging, significantly influencing the treatment strategy.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The number of women surviving after breast cancer is increasing, along with the length of time they are living with the after-effects of treatment. Although the treatment's effects are known to impact occupational participation, little is known about how breast cancer could affect occupational identity. This study aims to illuminate the lived experience of women long-term after breast cancer treatment through an occupational perspective in order to explore how they perceive their occupational identity. METHODS: A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted with six women, who had all received a diagnosis of breast cancer and treatment for longer than a year. Reflexive Thematic Analysis was used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Three intertwined themes describe the participants' experience. (1) 'Disruptions in daily life and Environmental support', (2) 'Be able to do' and identity, and (3) 'Doing what matters and is possible'. Findings revealed that the occupational identities of the participants were maintained. Cancer treatment effects appear to impact occupational competence that corresponded to participants' occupational identities, suggesting difficulties in the order of occupational adaptation. CONCLUSION: Our findings contribute to understanding the challenges to occupational participation related to the occupational identity of women following breast cancer and treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "After receiving the pathology report for breast cancer, the first question most patients ask their doctor is about their journey ahead. The type of cancer and how it spreads can give us an idea of what to expect during follow-up. Unfortunately, there is a lack of reporting, management, and documentation of breast cancer cases in India, resulting in a shortage of information on the different types of breast cancer. To address this issue, a study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the pattern of breast carcinoma in Northwestern India. A total of 2619 breast cancer pathology reports were gathered from four major diagnostic centres in Northwest India. Out of all breast cancer patients, 97.74% (2560) were women, while men accounted for only 2.25% (59) of the sample. At the time of diagnosis, 72% of patients were in stages III and IV, while only 28% of patients were in the early stages of cancer (stages I and II). The most common type of breast cancer was infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC), which constituted 80.71% (2114/2619) of all malignant lesions. infiltrating lobular carcinoma was the second most common pathology, accounting for 5.38% (141/2619) of all cases. The rarer pathologies had a presentation rate below 10%. Our study revealed the most common symptom as a painless lump. Significant majority presented in advanced stages. An alarming 20% presented with foul-smelling ulceration or fungation of the skin. Varied presentations of breast cancer subtypes were evident. As the age-old saying goes-the 'most common' is often ignored as a large portion of the researcher's attention is focused on 'rarer stuff'. Similarly, IDC being the commonest deserves most of our attention. Not just the histology but its grades too. The lack of awareness regarding the risk factors and early detection methods of breast cancer is unfortunately even prevalent in 49% of healthcare workers. What India needs are more data reporting, timely diagnostic strategies, standardized reporting for pathology, and guideline-based management strategies. Increasing data collection electronically in the coming years will help India in displaying more data.",

    "AbstractText": "Testicular cancer is notorious for its myriad presentations. In this case report, we present a 28-year-old gentleman diagnosed with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT). After receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he was found to have a large paracaval conglomerate nodal mass infiltrating the inferior vena cava (IVC), with a contiguous thrombus extending from the vena cava to the right atrium. The pre-operative imaging was ambiguous, with the cavo-atrial thrombus appearing to float within the vascular lumen at some places and infiltrating the caval wall at others. Hence, arrangements were made for cardiopulmonary bypass, sternotomy, and vascular surgeon backup. Intraoperatively, the vena cava was palpated in its entirety up to the mediastinum, and the thrombus was found to be freely floating. Hence, the thrombus was milked out in its entirety from the right atrium up to the vena cava, and the paracaval mass was resected en bloc with the tumor thrombus. The IVC was reconstructed with a Dacron graft. A review of the literature revealed no previously documented cases of contiguous cavo-atrial tumor thrombus. Approaching cases requires an assessment of the nature of the thrombus and the need to prepare for the worst. It is worth remembering that going the extra mile concerning obtaining a complete tumor clearance is worth it in NSGCTs, given the highly gratifying outcomes.",

    "AbstractText": "Current standard guidelines do not recommend a routine staging workup in early operable breast cancer (OBC) as the incidence of de novo metastasis is only 1-2%. Some of these patients are at high risk for relapse based on the higher axillary nodal burden. This prospective study evaluated the presence of de novo asymptomatic distant metastases in HROBC with pT1/2 N2a/N3 on upfront surgery. A single-centre study was carried out in upfront operated OBC patients with four or more axillary nodes positive after definitive surgery. Comprehensive metastatic workup was carried out, including an ultrasound abdomen, bone scan, and CT scan (thorax-abdomen-pelvis) or PET scan before initiating adjuvant treatment. If a distant disease was detected, the adjuvant treatment intent was tailored accordingly. The study accrued a prospective consecutive cohort of 97 women with pT1-2 N2a-3 during 2015-2018 operated upfront for OBC with cT1-2 N0-1. Forty percent of women were premenopausal, 54 (55.6%) had pN2a, and 43 (44.3%) had pN3 disease. Distant disease was seen in 8 of 97 women (8.24%) of these high-risk early cancers, 5 had oligometastatic denovo disease (5.15%), and 3 had polymetastatic (3.09%). Between the 2 groups, the pickup rate of distant disease was higher in pN3 (11.4%) as against pN2a (5.6%), p = NS. Only 3.09% of patients with extensive metastases were treated with palliative intent. The study shows potential to optimize the management of HROBC with heavy nodal disease identified post-primary surgery by selective staging investigations, adequate resource stratification, and thereby improved management, including modifying treatment plans early.",

We describe the methodology of a consensus CRS and HIPEC for peritoneal malignancies carried out under the aegis of the two national societies for peritoneal oncology-INDEPSO and ISPSM. The modified Delphi technique was used with two rounds of voting. Eight key topics were selected by a working group of 29 members. Questionnaires comprising of closed-ended questions were disseminated through the online SurveyMonkey (http://www.surveymonkey.com) platform. A panel of 56 surgical, gastrointestinal, and gynecologic oncologists with a minimum of 5 years of experience with CRS-HIPEC voted on 260 questions. A consensus was reached if any of the options received 70% or more votes (> 90% = strong consensus). The response rate was 98.2% in round I and 94.6% in round II. A consensus was achieved on 80.7% questions after two rounds (43.0% after round I; 36.9% after round II).

The surgical treatment should aim at fertility preservation by retaining the uterus and remaining ovarian function with comprehensive staging to rule out occult disease.

The use of indocyanine green fluoroscence angiography (ICG-FA) intra-operatively to ensure optimal perfusion is being increasingly used. This prospective study aimed to assess the role of ICG-FA in robot-assisted surgery for rectal cancer. This was a prospective cohort study carried out between July 2019 and July 2023, comprising patients undergoing elective robot-assisted rectal resection. The primary objective was to determine the role of ICG-FA in assessing bowel vascularity and in deciding the transection point of the bowel. The secondary objective was to assess the effect of ICG-FA on the post-operative outcomes, and also the effect of the various variables on the ICG staining grade. A total of 50 patients were included. Sixty percent of the patients received pre-operative radiotherapy, including short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) and long-course concurrent chemoradiation (LCRT). A change in transection line based on a less than normal ICG-FA grade was done in 11 patients (22%). Post-operatively, AL was present in 8 patients, out of whom 5 underwent re-operation. Administration of pre-operative RT was the only factor significantly associated with post-operative AL (p < 0.05). The present study showed that a change in the transection point based on the intra-operative ICG-FA was made in 22% of the patients. ICG-FA could hence be used as a potential adjunct to the operative surgeon in assessing the bowel vascularity in a minimally invasive approach like robotic or laparoscopic surgery.",

    "AbstractText": "Oral cancer is one of most common noncommunicable diseases that imposed significant burden on healthcare around the globe including India. Several molecular markers have been extensively researched for their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for oral cancer. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) found to play a crucial role in cytoskeleton dynamics and thus tumor growth and metastasis. The present study aims to analyze the MMP (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13) and TIMP (TIMP-1 and TIMP-3) expression in the oral cancer patients as compared to healthy controls. We also aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy of MMPs and TIMPs on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with respect to the immunohistochemistry (IHC). A total of 15 oral cancer patients and 14 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Blood sample from oral cancer patients and healthy controls was obtained to analyze the MMP and TIMP expression levels in serum sample using ELISA. Tumor tissue sample from patients for IHC analysis was obtained by biopsy under local anesthesia. Data were compared between ELISA and IHC for sensitivity and specificity analysis. The mean age of the patients was 47.07 ± 15.74 years with the highest incidence of disease found in male gender (86.7%). MMPs and TIMPs exhibited higher expression in oral cancer patients as compared to healthy controls and the difference was statistically significant in case of MMP-13. MMPs and TIMPs showed stronger expression at advanced stages of cancer on IHC with MMP-9 exhibiting the highest expression level. The highest sensitivity and specificity on ELISA with respect to IHC were exhibited by the MMP-3 followed by MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-3, and MMP-1. MMP-3 and MMP-13 were found to be reliable in terms of diagnostic marker for oral cancer as they found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity on ELISA with respect to IHC. MMP-9 was found to be reliable as a prognostic marker as it expresses highest on IHC at advanced stages of oral cancer.",

Therefore, a mutation in peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ can produce carcinogenesis. This present study aims to assess the expression of PPAR γ by immunohistochemistry in colorectal carcinoma and its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. Most of the cases were elderly males, and pelvic pain and bleeding were the predominant symptoms. Colon carcinoma was more common than rectal carcinoma. The adenocarcinoma NOS and mucinous carcinoma were the common histological types, and 40% cases showed lymph node metastasis. The PPAR γ expression was present in 61.8% of the patients, and it showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis and tumor location (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04). The overall survival was slightly higher but non-significant in patients with positive PPAR γ expression than negative ones (p = 0.7). The multivariate analysis revealed that nodal metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were the independent prognostic factors for colorectal carcinoma. The PPAR γ expression showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis and tumor location. Thus, we hypothesized that the PPAR γ expression might affect the overall survival in colorectal cancer. However, more studies with larger sample size are required to understand the nature of colorectal cancer expressing PPAR γ which might benefit the patient therapeutically in future.",

A prospectively maintained database of patients with right colon cancers managed between 2013 and 2019 was screened to identify those patients who underwent index surgery in a non-oncological setup. They were managed with adjuvant chemotherapy followed by observation, with surgery being reserved for recurrent disease. Of the 155 patients identified after the screening, 97 were included in the study. They were stratified depending upon the number of lymph nodes harvested at primary surgery-Group A (less than 12 nodes) (n = 49), Group B (12 to 27 nodes) (n = 39) and Group C (28 and more nodes) (n = 9). Patients with lymph node metastases had inferior survival at 2 years than node-negative patients and this survival difference increased progressively from Group A towards Group C. Patients who had radiological locoregional residual disease upon restaging (at presentation) had significantly inferior survival. At the end of 2 years, overall survival and disease-free survival of the cohort were 71.5% and 45.8%, respectively. Fifty-eight patients had disease relapse, with peritoneal recurrence seen in 37 patients (63.8%). Of these, only 15.5% recurrences were surgically salvageable. Treatment of patients who have undergone inadequate index colectomy with chemotherapy alone has shown inferior survival outcomes with high rates of peritoneal relapse in comparison to historical cohorts.

Advances in cancer treatment have significantly improved survival rates, highlighting survivorship issues, particularly fertility concerns in younger patients. Chemotherapy, while a crucial treatment for cancer, often brings with it unintended consequences, particularly regarding fertility. Chemotherapy induces gonadotoxicity through mechanisms such as DNA damage, follicular apoptosis, and hormonal disruption, compromising ovarian function and fertility. The risk of infertility may be low, intermediate, or high depending upon the drug used, the dose, and the duration of use. Quantifying chemotherapy's impact is challenging due to diverse agents and variable effects. Guidelines recommend discussing fertility preservation options with WCBP before treatment, using biomarkers like anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) to assess ovarian reserve. Strategies include cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, embryos, and oocytes, each with distinct advantages and considerations. Pharmacological interventions like GnRH agonists aim to mitigate gonadotoxic effects, although their efficacy is debated. Surgical approaches like oophoropexy protect ovaries during pelvic radiation but pose logistical challenges. Fertility preservation involves ethical and psychosocial dimensions, including informed consent, financial considerations, and ethical dilemmas, necessitating comprehensive patient counselling. Future research focuses on enhancing techniques such as in vitro maturation, developing artificial ovaries, and refining cryopreservation methods to optimize outcomes.",

Between November 2014 and December 2019, data on PCa patients treated with robot-assisted RP at a single tertiary referral center were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline ET levels were coded as abnormal (≤ 350 ng/dL) vs. normal (> 350 ng/dL) according to a standard consensus. In the surgical specimen, the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups 3 and 4/5 were classified as unfavorable tumor grades. Disease progression was defined as biochemical recurrence/persistence and/or local recurrence and/or distant metastases. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were used. Overall, 460 patients were included. In the surgical specimen, adverse tumor grades were detected in 198 (43.0%) patients of whom 60 (13.0%) harbored ISUP grade group 4/5. Disease progression occurred in 62 (13.5%) patients. In multivariable regression models that adjusted for other available clinical and pathological factors, patients with abnormal baseline ET levels were less likely to associate with unfavorable tumor grades, as well as to experience PCa progression (hazard ratio: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26-0.92; p = 0.026). In pathological organ-confined PCa, baseline ET levels predicted disease progression after discriminating unfavorable tumor grades.

Due to the obscure criteria available for diagnosing IBC, in this review, we gathered all the reliable information in the literature about the definition of IBC in the last decade to identify important features that should be considered in the diagnosis. We conducted this systematic review on MEDLINE and PUBMED by searching for the keywords \"inflammatory breast cancer,\" \"diagnosis,\" \"criteria,\" or \"definition.\" The time limit of this study was 13 years, from 2010 to 2023. Our basic search revealed 158 articles and finally 24 studies were approved and evaluated. The prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms and imaging and pathologic features were analyzed. The clinical criteria for the definition and diagnosis of IBC were mentioned in 100% of the studies, with the most common being skin changes (erythema, edema, and peau d'orange) in all 24 articles, rapid onset (< 6 months) in 66.6% of the studies, and involvement of at least one-third of the breasts in 41.6% of the studies. The imaging criteria for IBC diagnosis were discussed in 11 studies (45.8%), with the most common imaging sign being diffuse involvement of the breast and skin thickening (72.7%). Five studies (20.8%) evaluated the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of IBC and reported the following findings: heterogeneous enhancement, edema on T2-weighted images, asymmetrical enhancement, diffuse non-mass enhancement, skin enhancement, and Cooper's ligament enhancement. Pathology-specific findings were common in 10 articles (41.6%), which included dermal/non-dermal lymphatic tumor emboli. This study suggested that IBC should be suspected in the presence of rapid-onset (at least less than 6 months) erythema and edema, regardless of its extent, and when suspected, mammography and ultrasound should be performed to search for diffuse skin or parenchymal involvement, multicentric disease, and suspicious regional lymph nodes. MRI and skin biopsy could be helpful when the diagnosis is not clear (e.g., no underlying mass).",

The objective of the current study was to investigate the prognostic impact of novel histopathological features (TIL, TB, TBC, TSR) and a new combined risk score (CRS) in primary CRC. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides of 65 primary CRC cases. Stromal TIL was categorized into 3 groups: low (0 to 10%), intermediate (15 to 50%), and high (55 to 100%). Tumor budding was counted in 10 HPFs and graded as follows: 0-4 buds-low TB, 5-9 buds-intermediate TB, and 10 or more buds-high TB. TBC was labeled as either pushing or infiltrative. TSR was scored into two groups as high TSR (low stroma as ≤ 50%) and low TSR (high stroma > 50%). A novel CRS was constructed based on TBC, TB, and TSR: Infiltrating TBC, TB score > 5 (median), and low TSR were categorized as risk items. Final categories were as follows: low-risk tumors with ≤ 1 risk item and high-risk tumors with > 1 risk items. TIL showed a significant correlation with histological tumor type; TB was significantly associated with tumor location, grade, T stage, and perineural invasion, while TBC significantly correlated with tumor location only. TSR showed significant association with tumor location and perineural invasion, while the combined risk score significantly correlated with tumor location and grade. Tumor border configuration, tumor budding, tumor stroma ratio, and the newly formed combined risk score are simple, cost-effective, potential markers in colorectal cancer patients, suggesting that their incorporation in the routine histopathological evaluation could be useful in determining the prognosis of colorectal cancer cases.",

Primary outcome analysis indicated a shorter hospital stay with laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (S.M.D. =  - 0.18, 95% CI - 0.63 - 0.28, P = 0.45) and reduced blood loss (S.M.D. =  - 1.96, 95% CI - 3.05, 0.88, P = 0.0004), but increased operative time (S.M.D. = 1.74, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.53, P < 0.0001). The secondary outcomes showed no significant differences in morbidity, mortality, resection, fistula, gastric emptying, hemorrhage, bile leak, reoperation, readmission, and surgical site infection between the two procedures. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) offers marginal benefits over open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD), including reduced blood loss and shorter hospital stays. However, LPD requires a significantly longer operative time, and no substantial differences have been observed in terms of mortality or other complications. Additional studies with lower heterogeneity are needed to thoroughly evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of LPD and OPD.",

This study analyses the surgical outcomes and survival after surgery for pancreatic cancers from a single centre in south India. This is a retrospective analysis of pancreatic and periampullary cancer patients who were treated in our institute between January 2014 and November 2022 (n = 71). The median age at diagnosis was 55 years. In about 2/3rd of cases, tumour was located in periampullary region and 62 out of 71 patients underwent curative resection. The most common histopathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (87%). Nodal metastasis were detected in 13% of specimens. The predominant morbidity was delayed gastric emptying (DGE 12.7%) and clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF 11%) with a combined overall morbidity of 35.2% and 30-day mortality of 7.3%. Pre-op nutritional status had a strong association with postoperative morbidity. The median time of survival was 20 months, with a median follow-up of 22 months. Age less than 60 years (P value = 0.0264) and receiving all 6 or more cycles of chemo were significantly associated with improved survival (P value = 0.0297). Lower-stage cancers (T1, T2, and N0) were associated with better survival. The patient characteristics, histological factors, and perioperative outcomes were similar to the reports from other Indian studies. The 3-year survival rate was 30%. There was an increasing trend of survival in patients with age less than 60 years and in patients who received 6 or more cycles of chemotherapy.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of the number of NLNs removed on OC patients' survival and recurrence rate after primary surgery. In this multi-center cohort study, the medical profile of 504 OC patients (mean age 55.21 years and mean follow-up 78.5 ± 28.4 months) who underwent primary surgery between 2011 and 2021 in gynecological tumor surgery centers affiliated with Iran and Shahid Beheshti Universities of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, was retrospectively examined. Based on the number of NLNs removed, patients were divided into four groups, including 0-9, 10-19, 20-30, and > 30 NLNs, including 152, 169, 124, and 59 OC patients, respectively. The 5-year survival was 49.1%. The median survival was 61 months. The RFS and OS were significantly better in patients with more than 30 NLNs removed compared to other groups. The multivariable analysis showed that the OS rate was significantly better in patients with the number of NLNs removed ≥ 20 compared to < 20 (HR, 1.88; 95% CI 1.15-2.62; p, 0.001). Also, age, FIGO stage, presence of metastasis, adjuvant therapy, and tumor pathological differentiation were significantly related to the OS of OC patients (p < 0.05).

Fifteen patients who underwent oesophagectomy from 2020 to 2023 were analysed. The most common histology was squamous cell carcinoma. The mean age was 55 years and the majority were male. The common approaches used were open transhiatal and transthoracic oesophagectomy. The mean operative time was 9.5 h, and the mean hospital stay was 15.92 days. There were no perioperative deaths, but complications included pulmonary issues, vocal cord paralysis, anastomotic leaks, chyle leaks and wound infections. Higher volume centres tend to have better outcomes after oesophagectomy. However, factors other than volume like patient selection, ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocols, specialized critical care and trained multidisciplinary teams also impact outcomes. At our centre, though a low-volume hospital, proper patient selection, prehabilitation and a collaborative team approach helped achieve acceptable results. We recommend developing consensus on defining low- and high-volume centres for oesophagectomy in the Indian context, based on disease burden, resources and constraints.

There has been a trend towards worse prognosis in this group. This study compares the oncological and surgical outcomes of patients with and without pre-operative oligometastasis who underwent ISR. The outcomes compared include prognostic factors like margin positivity, recurrence rates, stoma reversal rate, and surgical failure rate (defined as a combination of one or more of the aforestated factors). The demographic pattern, American Society of Anaesthesia grade (ASA), treatment received, clinical and histopathological T and N stage, grade, type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach, neoadjuvant therapy, and pathological high-risk features are also studied. Patients who underwent minimally invasive ISR over 10 years at a high-volume tertiary cancer center were selected for the study. Factors used for the assessment of oncological outcomes were margin positivity (circumferential resection and distal margin), recurrence (both local and systemic), and stoma reversal rate. A descriptive and comparative analyses were performed. Four hundred and eight patients underwent minimally invasive ISR of which 25 (6.12%) patients were oligometastatic. While R0 resection was similar in both groups, higher overall recurrence (24% versus 18.5%) and low stoma reversal rate (36.8% versus 67.3%) were observed in the oligometastatic group with statistically significant differences. No local recurrence was seen in the oligometastatic group, and the difference compared to non-metastatic group was not statistically different. This study indicates that oligometastatic patients who underwent ISR experienced lower stoma reversal rates, maintaining similar local control but facing higher rates of systemic recurrence.

    "AbstractText": "Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is a precision medicine approach that involves the targeted delivery of radioactive atoms to tumor cells, representing a breakthrough strategy for cancer treatment. Radiopharmaceuticals typically consist of a small amount of radioactive material, a radionuclide, paired with a chemical that specifically targets the cell. Some radionuclides naturally target specific cells or biological processes without the need for modification. RPT is a novel cancer treatment method that offers various advantages over current traditional treatment approaches. One of the primary advantages of RPT is its ability to target cancer cells, including those in metastatic areas. Another key advantage of RPT is that radiation can be delivered systemically, locally, or physiologically to specific cells internally rather than being applied externally. Moreover, radiotracer imaging can be utilized to determine radiopharmaceutical absorption in target tissues before providing a therapeutic dose. Compared to all other cancer treatment approaches, RPT has demonstrated high efficacy with minimal toxicity. The recent approval of multiple RPT medicines by the US Food and Drug Administration highlights the tremendous potential of this treatment. This article provides a detailed review of RPT, including insights into manufacturing procedures, safety measures, and its applications in cancer therapy.",

Imaging commonly used for diagnostic workup includes computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scans can be used for investigating equivocal findings on radiographic imaging. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is known to be highly expressed in prostate adenocarcinoma, allowing it to be leveraged as a target for both imaging and radioligand therapy in prostate cancer. However, PSMA is also commonly expressed in other malignancies such as breast cancer, thyroid carcinomas, and head and neck malignancies, which increase the chances of their incidental diagnosis on PSMA PET scans. Biliary tract cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma, are not commonly expected to be incidentally diagnosed on PSMA PET imaging. Here, we describe the case of a patient with known prostate adenocarcinoma who was later incidentally diagnosed with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma on PSMA PET/computed tomography (CT). This case highlights the unexpected finding of cholangiocarcinoma on PSMA PET/CT and suggests further investigation into the role of PSMA PET in diagnosing ambiguous cases of cholangiocarcinoma and its potential theranostic applications.",

This study aimed to understand how glucose metabolic activity can be shown with less statistical noise using a quality assessment phantom modeled after cancer lesions with a two-layer structure and a Clear adaptive Low-noise Method (CaLM) filter. Materials and Methods  A National Electrical Manufacturers Association phantom with two spheres with a two-layer structure filled with 2-deoxy-2[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (inner and outer diameters of the spheres were 13/22 and 22/37 mm, respectively; radioactivity ratio of the background [BG] to outer sphere layer was 1:4; and BG-to-inner sphere layer ratios were 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) was evaluated. The acquisition time was set at 120 seconds, and imaging was repeated five times. The image data in photomultiplier tube (PMT)-PET were reconstructed using a time-of-flight (TOF) ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm (point spread function [PSF] - , iteration: 3, subset: 10) with a 4-mm Gaussian filter (GF) for normal images. Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-PET data were reconstructed using a TOF OSEM algorithm (PSF - , iteration: 2, subset: 12) and a 3-mm GF for normal images. The target images were reconstructed using three CaLM parameters (mild, standard, and strong). All the obtained images were investigated quantitatively, with calculation of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), coefficient of variation (CV), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), after setting regions of interest on the lesions. Statistical analysis using the Dunnett's test compared normal images (control group) and target images (treatment group). Statistical significance was considered at p  < 0.05. Results  Quantitative assessment revealed that the SUVmax of target images (standard and strong) was equivalent to that of normal images in PMT-PET, with SUVmax of 3 to 3.5 for both layers. The SUVmax in SiPM-PET was similar across all CaLM types, ranging from 3 to 4 for all spheres. The target images (standard and strong) had a significantly reduced CV and improved CNR compared with normal images. Conclusion  The boundary of the 22/37-mm spheres was visible with CaLM (strong) at radioactivity ratios of 1:4:1 and 1:4:2 on both scanners. For the 13/22-mm sphere boundary, visibility with CaLM (strong) was observed only with SiPM-PET, with the SUVmax equivalent to normal images. CaLM (strong) was deemed the optimal postprocessing filter for PMT-PET due to significant improvements in CV and CNR, while CaLM (standard) was suggested as the optimal filter for SiPM-PET due to excessive BG smoothing.",

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an effective treatment option, with an efficacy comparable to that of surgical resection. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements and controversial issues regarding SBRT for lung oligometastases. It focuses on four crucial perspectives: efficacy of SBRT, optimal patient selection criteria, technological innovations, and synergistic effects of SBRT combined with systemic therapy. Relevant clinical trials investigating SBRT for lung oligometastases have been conducted, with median 1- and 5-year local control rates of 90% and 79%, respectively. The origin of the primary tumor, size and number of lesions, and biomarker profiles were highlighted as pivotal considerations in patient selection. The precise dose delivery was enhanced using robotic SBRT and optimized dose fractionation schemes. Evidence suggests that dose escalation above 100 Gy biologically effective dose may improve tumor control. Combined immunotherapy and SBRT have demonstrated synergistic effects in prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival. This review provides valuable insights into the precise treatment of oligometastatic lung diseases using SBRT. Further multicenter randomized trials are warranted to develop definitive patient selection criteria and optimize the integration with systemic therapies.",

The current photon-based radiotherapy modalities and procedures have increased the incidence of treatment-related cardiac and pulmonary complications. Additionally, anatomical changes in the esophagus resulting from diaphragmatic movement, weight loss, and tumor progression present challenges for radiotherapy. These challenges have spurred interest in particle therapies, such as proton beam therapy (PBT) and heavy-ion therapy, for esophageal cancer. This paper comprehensively reviews the dosimetric advantages, clinical efficacy, and limitations of PBT and heavy-ion therapy for esophageal cancer and discusses their prospects. This highlights the unique dosimetric benefits of these therapies, particularly their ability to deliver high-dose radiation precisely to the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal organs and tissues. Although PBT and heavy-ion therapy demonstrate superior clinical efficacy compared to photon therapy, they are not without limitations. Multiple studies are needed to further validate and supplement the existing clinical and preclinical data to better exploit the benefits of PBT and thereby provide improved survival advantages to these patients.",

So, in this research a novel BC Detection using Transfer learning network (BCD-TransNet) is introduced to identify and classify BC stages. Initially, the histopathological images from BreakHis dataset are pre-processed using stationary wavelet based Retinex (SWR) for eliminating the noise and progress the image quality. The noise-free images are segmented using the Hybrid Greedy Snake-Krill Herd Optimization (HGS-KHO) algorithm. The BCD-TransNet model that incorporates with five different pre-trained networks in which the knowledge attained by each model is transfer to next network for extracting the most relevant features. This detection model has two different phases namely first level classification for identifying benign and malignant cells and the second level classification for identifying the different types in benign and malignant. Finally, the ML-based Decision tree is used to detect the stages of breast tumour. From the simulation analysis, the BCD-TransNet present well accuracy of 99.31% for the classification of breast tumour.

Antioxidants, like curcumin (Cur), can inhibit these factors. In this research, the effect of curcumin on the expression and activity of two MMP enzymes, MMP-14 and MMP-17, which are involved in the carcinogenesis of mice after chronic exposure to thioacetamide, is investigated. METHODS: In this study, 30 mice were divided into six groups and studied for 4 months. The first group, control; the second group, curcumin; the third group, TAA; the fourth group, TAA and curcumin simultaneously; the fifth group, first treated with TAA for 2 months and then curcumin; and finally, the sixth group, first treated with curcumin for 2 months and then TAA. Afterward, the mice were euthanized, and their liver tissues were transferred to the laboratory for analysis of gene and protein expression. RESULTS: The averages of gene expression were calculated using SigmaPlot software and showed that the expression of MMP-17 and MMP-24 genes and the levels of their proteins were significantly increased by thioacetamide (****p < 0001) compared to the control group. Pathological observations indicated necrosis and dysplastic foci in the TAA group. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the crucial roles of MMPs in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, the regulation of their gene expression and enzymatic activity is significant in preventing tumor progression.

It was suggested that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) are a powerful inducer of inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells. This research aimed to determine the anticancer potential of E. coli-derived OMVs using a colorectal cancer model. METHODS: Five distinct E. coli strains were collected for this study. Their OMVs were then isolated and characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of E. coli-derived OMVs on colorectal cancer were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using a colorectal tumor model in nude mice. RESULTS: Obtained results showed that E. coli probiotic strains released spherical-shaped vesicles ranging from 5 to 200 nm. E. coli-derived OMVs showed that in the untreated group, a large portion of the tumor tissue continued to grow, with only a few cells undergoing apoptosis. Conversely, the OMV-treated group exhibited a higher number of apoptotic cells, highlighting the anticancer effects of E. coli-derived OMVs in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that E. coli-derived OMVs can be employed as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer with minimal adverse effects. Mechanistic studies indicate that these vesicles may promote apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, supporting their therapeutic potential.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Pan-cancer analysis of MET mutation and its association with the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade.",
    "AbstractText": "The mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) proto-oncogene plays important roles during tumor development. Recently, evidence has revealed MET signaling may impact tumor immunogenicity and regulate the immune response. Here we conducted a comprehensive bioinformatic and clinical analysis to explore the characteristics of MET mutation and its association with the outcomes in pan-cancer immunotherapy. In 4149 patients with 12 tumor types treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, MET mutation indicated favorable overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.50-0.74; P < 0.001), progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.92; P = 0.01), and objective response rate (40.3% vs. 28.1%; P = 0.003). Moreover, we developed a nomogram to estimate the 12-month and 24-month survival probabilities after the initiation of immunotherapy. Further multi-omics analysis on both intrinsic and extrinsic immune landscapes revealed that MET mutation enhanced tumor immunogenicity, enriched infiltration of immune cells, and improved immune responses. In summary, MET mutation improves cancer immunity and is an independent biomarker for favorable outcomes in pan-cancer immunotherapy. These results may influence clinical practices, guide treatment decision-making, and develop immunotherapy for personalized care.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Acoustofluidics-Based Intracellular Nanoparticle Delivery.",
    "AbstractText": "Controlled intracellular delivery of biomolecular cargo is critical for developing targeted therapeutics and cell reprogramming. Conventional delivery approaches (e.g., endocytosis of nano-vectors, microinjection, and electroporation) usually require time-consuming uptake processes, labor-intensive operations, and/or costly specialized equipment. Here, we present an acoustofluidics-based intracellular delivery approach capable of effectively delivering various functional nanomaterials to multiple cell types (e.g., adherent and suspension cancer cells). By tuning the standing acoustic waves in a glass capillary, our approach can push cells in flow to the capillary wall and enhance membrane permeability by increasing membrane stress to deform cells via acoustic radiation forces. Moreover, by coating the capillary with cargo-encapsulated nanoparticles, our approach can achieve controllable cell-nanoparticle contact and facilitate nanomaterial delivery beyond Brownian movement. Based on these mechanisms, we have successfully delivered nanoparticles loaded with small molecules or protein-based cargo to U937 and HeLa cells. Our results demonstrate enhanced delivery efficiency compared to attempts made without the use of acoustofluidics. Moreover, compared to conventional sonoporation methods, our approach does not require special contrast agents with microbubbles. This acoustofluidics-based approach creates exciting opportunities to achieve controllable intracellular delivery of various biomolecular cargoes to diverse cell types for potential therapeutic applications and biophysical studies.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: With advances in rectal cancer management and improved prognosis, there is a growing number of rectal cancer survivors with unique needs. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that a significant proportion of our rectal cancer survivors lack regular access to a primary care physician. Our study aimed to examine the association between access to a primary care physician and survivorship-related emergency department visits. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of rectal cancer survivors who have finished all treatment. PATIENTS: Patients with rectal cancer who underwent proctectomy and completed treatment from 2005 to 2021. SETTING: Single tertiary care center in Quebec, Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survivorship-related emergency department visits. RESULTS: In total, 432 rectal cancer survivors were included. The median age was 72 (interquartile range, 63-82) years, 190 (44.0%) were women, and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 5 (interquartile range, 4-6). There were 153 individuals (35.4%) not registered with a primary care physician. Sixty individuals visited the emergency department due to survivorship-related concerns. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, lack of registration to primary care physicians was associated with a higher probability of having survivorship-related emergency department visits. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by observational design. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of regular access to primary care physicians may contribute to increased emergency department visits among rectal cancer survivors. Efforts to improve access to a primary care physician and coordinate interdisciplinary care are needed to improve care for survivors. See Video Abstract.

    "ArticleTitle": "Adverse events associated with the use of radiopharmaceuticals: A prospective study from a tertiary care institute.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Radiopharmaceuticals (RPs) are used in the diagnosis and management of various cancer and noncancerous conditions. Like those of conventional drugs, the use of RPs may also be associated with the development of various adverse events (AEs). The information obtained from patients about these AEs may empower medical professionals to identify, evaluate, and manage them more efficiently to ensure the safe use of RPs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the type, timing, and frequency of the reported AEs associated with the use of RPs and to establish their causal association as well as to evaluate the outcome of these AEs from the perspective of patients. METHODS: This study was a prospective cohort study conducted on 315 patients who underwent nuclear medicine examination in a tertiary care center for various indications. Relevant data were collected from the participants regarding suspected AEs associated with the use of various RPs. The collected data were objectively analyzed and assessed. RESULTS: Of 315 patients, 39 (12.3%) developed 59 AEs. All the reported AEs were mild in nature and neither required hospitalization nor caused death of any participants. 37.2% of the reported AEs occurred within 1 h of administration of the RPs and spontaneously resolved within a few hours. Of these 59 AEs, 10 had causal associations (possible or probable) with RPs and were considered adverse drug reaction (ADR). The incidence of ADR in our study was 2.2%. CONCLUSION: RPs can cause ADRs though it is less in comparison to conventional drugs. We expect that our study will increase the awareness of AEs associated with the use of RPs among patients and health-care professionals and encourage its reporting.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to share our experience with patients with heart disease requiring open heart surgery who also had a concomitant lung mass. METHODS: This retrospective study included 22 patients (20 males, 2 females; mean age: 63.6 years; range, 43 to 79 years) who required open heart surgery and had a detected lung mass during preoperative evaluation. All the patients were discussed between cardiac and thoracic surgery teams, and different approaches according to patient and mass characters were chosen. Thoracic computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans and, when needed, biopsies were used to determine mass characters. RESULTS: Seven patients were deemed to have small benign nodules, and it was decided not to intervene on the mass. A biopsy before surgery was performed in two patients, and an intervention was not deemed necessary in these patients. One patient was evaluated as having late-stage lung cancer, and no cardiac surgical intervention was performed. Ten patients underwent cardiac surgery and lung resections or lobectomies in a simultaneous operation. Two of the patients subsequently underwent a separate thoracic surgery after the cardiac surgery. There was no perioperative mortality or myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Managing patients with both cardiac disease requiring surgery and a lung mass is complex and necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. The decision to perform combined surgery or staged procedures should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, the nature of the lung mass, and the urgency of the cardiac condition. While outcomes for combined procedures are generally favorable in well-selected patients, they require meticulous perioperative planning and long-term follow-up.",

POLEmut usually correlates with a favorable outcome. Hence, we reviewed the research since the TCGA molecular subtypes developed in 2013 and summarized the characteristics and prognosis of POLEmut EC patients. In summary, we found POLEmut occurs in 7.3%-9.6% of EC in the previous studies. POLEmut EC consistently exhibits favorable patient outcomes, regardless of adjuvant therapy. The research of POLEmut in EC is absent in Taiwan, and the underlying mechanisms and cost-effectiveness need further investigation.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Smoking is a major lung cancer risk factor. Studies show that smoking after lung cancer diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of developing other cancers and shorter survival. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between postdiagnosis smoking cessation and survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Data were collected between January 2014 and December 2019 in three hospitals in Southern Taiwan. Patient data were collected from the hospitals' databases, and the correlation between smoking status and patient survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS: A total of 681 patients with advanced NSCLC were included in this study. The numbers (percentage) of ex-smokers and current smokers were 334 (49%) and 347 (51%), respectively. More than half of the patients in this study continued to smoke postdiagnosis advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, ex-smokers had lower mortality risk, even though this was not statistically significant (P = 0.212). The results of this study suggest that older than 65 years, men, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 3 and higher, history of chronic disease, receive chemotherapy, and targeted therapy are correlated with and have predictive effects on advanced NSCLC survival. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference between postdiagnosis smoking cessation and survival in patients with advanced NSCLC. The reason for this finding may be due to lower survival rates after diagnosis with advanced NSCLC, and the benefits of smoking cessation cannot be seen immediately.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Associations of Helicobacter pylori with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and related conditions: cross-sectional results from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Hispanic/Latino populations have been reported to have high rates of both metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and Helicobacter pylori infection. Several observational studies, predominantly from Asian populations, have suggested a link between these conditions. Thus, the primary objective of the current study was to examine the association between H. pylori and MASLD and secondarily, to assess its association with related conditions in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 16,144 participants with baseline data on H. pylori serology were included. Based on weighted statistics, the median age was 40 years [interquartile range (IQR): 28, 52]; 52.2% women (n = 9661) and 47.8% men (n = 6483). Participants' Hispanic/Latino heritage included 37.6% Mexicans (n = 6397), 20.1% Cubans (n = 2307), 15.8% Puerto Ricans (n = 2663), 10.0% Dominicans (n = 1447), 7.4% Central Americans (n = 1710), 4.9% South Americans (1052). MASLD was estimated using the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI). Other conditions examined were obesity, central obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate the ratios of (adjusted) prevalences (RP) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the overall association of H. pylori seropositivity with MASLD and related conditions. Analyses were also stratified by Hispanic/Latino heritage. FINDINGS: The overall prevalence of MASLD ranged from 47% (FLI) to 65% (HSI). After accounting for age, sex, education, and other key variables, the analysis found a modest association between H. pylori seropositivity and MASLD as determined by HSI (RP: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10) overall, and among individuals of Puerto Rican and Mexican heritages. Furthermore, an overall association between H. pylori seropositivity and obesity was observed (RP: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16). INTERPRETATION: This study provides support for a positive association of H. pylori seropositivity with MASLD and obesity among Hispanic/Latino populations. However, given the exploratory nature of these findings, caution is warranted in their interpretation. Further research is necessary to establish causality and examine potential mechanisms of these associations. FUNDING: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos was carried out as a collaborative study supported by contracts from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to the University of North Carolina (N01-HC65233), University of Miami (N01-HC65234), Albert Einstein College of Medicine (N01-HC65235), Northwestern University (N01-HC65236), San Diego State University (N01-HC65237), and University of Illinois at Chicago (HHSN268201300003I).

Our approach incorporates a utility function to balance the trade-off between risk and benefit and directly models the utility of each dose by constructing a quasi-beta-binomial model. A key advantage of our design is the simplification of decision-making during interim periods by considering all possible outcomes and pre-including the decision rule in the protocol. Additionally, we present a time-to-event (TITE) version of our design, employing an approximate likelihood approach to mitigate potential late-onset effects.

However, there have been few studies on ILL's antitumor role and no reports on its role in bladder cancer (BC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human BC cell lines T24 and EJ-1 were treated with different concentrations of ILL (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μmol/L), and the cell proliferation inhibition rate was analyzed using the CCK-8 assay. The effect of ILL on T24 and EJ-1 cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry. Immunoblotting was used to detect the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, BAX, BAK1, and CYCS, in BC cells of the control and ILL-treated groups, and quantitative PCR experiments were performed to detect the apoptosis-related gene expression of CASP10, CYCS, BAX, BCL-2, CASP8, and BAK1. T24 and EJ-1 tumor-bearing mouse models were established and divided into vehicle control, low-dose (10 mg/kg) and high-dose (20 mg/kg) groups, with 5 mice in each group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry were used to detect changes in apoptosis-related proteins in vivo. RESULTS: The CCK-8 assay showed that in vitro, ILL significantly inhibited the proliferation of the T24 and EJ-1 BC cell lines. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting results showed that ILL increased mitochondrial permeability by upregulating proapoptotic proteins BAK1 and BAX, promoting CYCS release and significantly inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In vivo, on day 25 of administration, tumor inhibition rates in T24 and EJ-1 tumor-bearing mice were up to 75.24% and 47.43%, respectively, in the ILL high-dose-treated and 71.58% and 43.89%, respectively, in the ILL low-dose-treated groups.

Radiogenomics is an extension of radiomics and involves a combination of conventional radiomics techniques with molecular analysis in the form of genomic and transcriptomic data. In the field of bladder cancer, studies have investigated the development, implementation, and efficacy of radiomic and radiogenomic nomograms in predicting tumor grade, gene expression, and oncological outcomes, with variable results. We aimed to perform a systematic review of the current literature to investigate the development of a radiomics-based nomogram to predict oncological outcomes in bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to February 17, 2023. Gray literature was also searched to further identify other suitable publications. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and Radiomics Quality Score.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival (OS), and locoregional recurrence-free survival of young surgical patients with non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Retrospective review of an institutional database of patients aged 50 years or younger undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer between January 1995 and March 2022. A control group of patients older than age 50 years was selected by stratified random sampling. Relevant characteristics were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum,χ,2 and Fisher exact tests. Propensity-score weighting was used to control for confounders. OS and locoregional recurrence-free survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: We identified 196 patients aged 50 years or younger and 232 patients older than age 50 years. Median age was 46 years (interquartile range, 43-49 years) in the younger group and 69 years (interquartile range, 63-74 years) in the older group. Younger patients were more often women, non-White, and with fewer comorbidities. They more often presented with symptoms, stage III or IV disease, and more often received neoadjuvant therapy. In unweighted analysis, younger patients showed superior OS (log-rank P < .0001). After propensity score weighting for procedure type, histologic type, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and smoking status, there was no significant difference in OS at 5 years between younger and older groups (70.62% vs 72.99%; weighted log-rank P = .084). Younger patients showed superior OS (weighted log-rank P = .0006) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (weighted log-rank P = .017) for clinical stage I, but not any other stage. lymphovascular invasion was an independent risk factor for worsened OS and locoregional recurrence-free survival across ages. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing lung cancer as a differential diagnosis for patients aged 50 years or younger is crucial because this group shows superior outcomes for stage I disease. Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic risk factor across age groups.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Individual-Level Factors that Contribute to Delayed Cervical Cancer Diagnosis among Patients in Kenya; A Hospital-Based Assessment.",
    "AbstractText": "Cervical cancer ranks 4th as the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide. In Kenya, it is the 2nd most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Globally, more than 50% of Cervical Cancer diagnoses are made late, with this proportion rising to over 80% in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the individual-level factors contributing to delayed cervical cancer diagnosis. A cross-sectional hospital-based study was adopted to collect data on; Socio-demographics, affordability and use of health insurance, Cervical cancer and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening awareness, Prior HPV screening, Diagnosis circumstances, Time taken to seek medical attention, Fears and social support experiences, from 139 cervical cancer patients systematically sampled at the Kenyatta National Hospital, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Additionally, 8 Key Informants were purposively selected, to provide in-depth information. Associations between stage at diagnosis and individual-level factors were tested using logistic regression at 95% Confidence Interval. The mean age was 51 years and all participants were African and Christians. Majority (63.31%) were married and educated up to primary level, and more than half (61.15%) were unemployed. The prevalence of delayed diagnosis was 86(61.9%). The Risk Factors for delayed diagnosis were; Older age; 50-59 (p-value=0.049) & 60-69 years (0.013), Lack of HPV screening awareness (P-value=0.017), and Seeking medical attention only due to a symptomatic trigger (P-value=0.030). In corroboration, qualitative information reported that, inability to afford diagnosis costs, lack of awareness and poor medical care seeking habits, contribute to delayed diagnosis. The study identified gaps in awareness of Cervical Cancer and HPV screening among women and affordability of diagnosis costs. More community-level awareness should be created and, increase of centers and resources for diagnosis and free screening. Women should also be encouraged to pay for the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), so as to lessen their financial burden of diagnosis.",

    "AbstractText": "The discovery and development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionised the management of human cancers. However, only a subset of patients responds to ICI therapy, even though immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Initially, treatment was administered to patients on the basis of expression levels of one of the targets of ICI therapy, programmed cell death ligand 1. In clinical trials, the high response rate of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients to ICI therapy supported the basic premise of cancer immunotherapy, that tumour-specific mutated proteins trigger an immune response. Tumour mutational burden subsequently emerged as a potential biomarker for response to ICI therapy. This review summarises the evidence supporting the scientific rationale for TMB as a biomarker for ICI therapy and focuses on some of the major challenges associated with incorporation of TMB into routine clinical practice.",

    "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint blockade therapy targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis has shown remarkable clinical impact in multiple cancer types. Nonetheless, despite the recent success of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, such response rates in cancer patients have been limited to tumors encompassing specific tumor microenvironment characteristics. The altered metabolic activity of cancer cells shapes the anti-tumor immune response by affecting the activity of immune cells. However, it remains mostly unknown how the altered metabolic activity of cancer cells impacts their resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. Here, we found that tumor cell-derived lactic acid renders the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistant tumors by inhibiting the interaction between the PD-L1 protein and anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, we showed that the combination therapy of targeting PD-L1 with our PD-L1 antibody-drug conjugate (PD-L1-ADC) and reducing lactic acid with the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) inhibitor, AZD3965, can effectively treat the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistant tumors. The findings of this study provide a new mechanism of how lactic acid induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and suggest a potential combination treatment to overcome the tumor resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy.",

METHODS: Information reported on death certificates is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision . Beginning in 2018, all states and the District of Columbia were using the 2003 revised certificate of death for the entire year, which includes the 1997 Office of Management and Budget revised standards for race. Data based on these revised standards are not completely comparable to previous years. RESULTS: In 2021, a total of 3,464,231 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 879.7 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, an increase of 5.3% from the 2020 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years, a decrease of 0.6 year from 2020. Age-specific death rates increased from 2020 to 2021 for every age group. In 2021, 9 of the 10 leading causes of death remained the same as in 2020. Heart disease remained the top leading cause, followed by cancer and COVID-19. The infant mortality rate of 5.44 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021 did not change significantly from the rate in 2020 (5.42). CONCLUSIONS: In 2021, the age-adjusted death rate increased and life expectancy at birth decreased for the total, male, and female populations, primarily due to the influence of deaths from COVID-19.",

While the penetration of UV radiation through vehicle windows is well-documented, the potential transmission of IR radiation remains less recognized. METHODS: A total of 1,293 participants participated in a survey to assess awareness of solar radiation risks and protective behaviors, revealing a notable lack of attention to protective measures despite widespread knowledge of the risks associated with solar exposure. This study investigates UV and IR radiation exposure inside and outside vehicles in the Middle East, a region known for its extreme temperatures exceeding 52°C. Radiation levels were measured using a PMA2100 data logger radiometer in 20 vehicles. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated the ability of both UV and IR radiation to transmit through vehicle windows. For instance, the highest UV transmission through the side and front windows were recorded at 1.70 and 0.80 mW/cm2, respectively, while the IR transmission through the side and front windows were 84.17 and 98.27 mW/cm2, respectively. These findings highlight the need for improved protective measures against both UV and IR radiation, especially in hot climates where prolonged exposure to solar radiation is common. The study also identifies a gap in public awareness of IR radiation and calls for further research into effective strategies for mitigating these risks.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Fast model calibration for predicting the response of breast cancer to chemotherapy using proper orthogonal decomposition.",
    "AbstractText": "Constructing digital twins for predictive tumor treatment response models can have a high computational demand that presents a practical barrier for their clinical adoption. In this work, we demonstrate that proper orthogonal decomposition, by which a low-dimensional representation of the full model is constructed, can be used to dramatically reduce the computational time required to calibrate a partial differential equation model to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for rapid predictions of tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. In the proposed formulation, the reduction basis is based on each patient's own MRI data and controls the overall size of the \"reduced order model\". Using the full model as the reference, we validate that the reduced order mathematical model can accurately predict response in 50 triple negative breast cancer patients receiving standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The concordance correlation coefficient between the full and reduced order models was 0.986 ± 0.012 (mean ± standard deviation) for predicting changes in both tumor volume and cellularity across the entire model family, with a corresponding median local error (inter-quartile range) of 4.36% (1.22%, 15.04%). The total time to estimate parameters and to predict response dramatically improves with the reduced framework. Specifically, the reduced order model accelerates our calibration by a factor of (mean ± standard deviation) 378.4 ± 279.8 when compared to the full order model for a non-mechanically coupled model. This enormous reduction in computational time can directly help realize the practical construction of digital twins when the access to computational resources is limited.",

    "AbstractText": "Exosomes encompass a great deal of valuable biological information and play a critical role in tumor development. However, the mechanism of exosomal lncRNAs remains poorly elucidated in bladder cancer (BCa). In this study, we identified exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1 as a novel biomarker in BCa diagnosis and aimed to investigate the underlying biological function. Dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pulldown assays, and xenograft mouse model were used to verify the competitive endogenous RNA mechanism of lnc-TAF12-2:1. We found exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1 up-regulated in urinary exosomes, tumor tissues of patients, and BCa cells. Down-regulation of lnc-TAF12-2:1 impaired BCa cell proliferation and migration, and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis. The opposite effects were also observed when lnc-TAF12-2:1 was overexpressed. lnc-TAF12-2:1 was transferred by intercellular exosomes to modulate malignant biological behavior. Mechanistically, lnc-TAF12-2:1 packaged in the exosomes relieved the miRNA-mediated silence effect on ASB12 via serving as a sponger of miR-7847-3p to accelerate progression in BCa. ASB12 was also first proved as an oncogene to promote cell proliferation and migration and depress cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in our data. In conclusion, exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1, located in the cytoplasm of BCa, might act as a competitive endogenous RNA to competitively bind to miR-7847-3p, and then be involved in miR-7847-3p/ASB12 regulatory axis to promote tumorigenesis, which provided a deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of BCa.",

Aims  This article assesses the Ultracor Twirl clip for safety and imaging artifacts in a 7T MRI scanner. Setting and Design  This study can be categorized as a phantom study. Materials and Methods  Tests for magnetic susceptibility (translational attraction and torque), MRI-related heating, and artifacts were conducted based on the American Society for Testing and Materials standards. The magnetic susceptibility tests evaluated the scanner's magnetic force that can cause clip movement and rotation. The heating test was conducted with customized MRI parameters of short TR and maximum echo-train length, designed to induce temperature change. The artifact test, using T1-weighted spin and gradient echo imaging sequences, evaluated potential image misrepresentations (localized signal loss) caused by the clip's metallic properties. Statistical Tests  None. Results and Conclusion  The magnetic susceptibility tests indicated no noticeable translational or rotational force exerted by the MRI scanner. The heating test indicated no significant temperature change (<0.3°C) in the testing gel when the clip was absent/present, both within the safety threshold (<1°C). The artifact test's clip images all contained an artifact (largest radius = 10.7 mm). These cumulative results indicate that this clip is safe in 7T scanners. Scanning at least 10.7 mm away from the clip avoids potential signal loss in the region of interest.",

    "AbstractText": "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with dismal prognosis. GBC is characterized by marked geographic predilection. GBC has distinct morphological types that pose unique challenges in diagnosis and differentiation from benign lesions. There are no specific clinical or serological markers of GBC. Imaging plays a key role not only in diagnosis and staging but also in prognostication. Ultrasound (US) is the initial test of choice that allows risk stratification in wall thickening and polypoidal type of gallbladder lesions. US findings guide further investigations and management. Computed tomography (CT) is the test of choice for staging GBC as it allows comprehensive evaluation of the gallbladder lesion, liver involvement, lymph nodes, peritoneum, and other distant sites for potential metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography allow better delineation of the biliary system involvement. Contrast-enhanced US and advanced MRI techniques including diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI are used as problem-solving tools in cases where distinction from benign lesion is challenging at US and CT. Positron emission tomography is also used in selected cases for accurate staging of the disease.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nodules (PNs) are frequently detected by chest CT scan, which is increasingly used in clinical practice. Accurately identifying malignant nodules can pose a diagnostic challenge; therefore, a high-specificity biomarker could help clinicians identify malignant nodules and ideally lead to the earlier diagnosis of lung cancer. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the performance characteristics of a blood-based biomarker for identifying malignancy in patients with a CT-detected PN? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Banked plasma samples from 2 independent prospective observational cohorts of patients presenting with benign or malignant PNs 8 to 30 mm in size were tested using a 7-autoantibody panel. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the autoantibody test (AAT) to identify cancer were calculated for the individual and combined cohorts. RESULTS: Overall, 447 patients (263 and 184 from each cohort) were included in the analysis with a prevalence of malignancy of 55%. The performance of the AAT between the 2 cohorts was similar. The AAT demonstrated a specificity of 90% (95% CI, 85%-93%), a positive predictive value of 66% (95% CI, 52%-77%), sensitivity of 16% (95% CI, 12%-22%), and false-positive rate of 10% in the combined cohort. Using a pretest probability of cancer cutoff of 20% improved the positive predictive value to 76% (95% CI, 61%-88%) and resulted in a 52% decrease in the number of false-positive test results. In the subset of patients who had 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging performed for clinical purposes (n = 222), specificity of the AAT was higher (93% vs 58%, P < .001), but the sensitivity was lower than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan (17% vs 75%, P < .001). INTERPRETATION: This study validates the specificity of a blood-based autoantibody biomarker for identifying malignancy in patients with indeterminate PNs. This rule-in biomarker may help to expedite workup of malignant nodules.

The authors hypothesized that the implant foreign body response could induce a local protective anticancer immunosurveillance. The authors expanded on their previous finding, which showed that women with breast implants have elevated antibody responses to certain breast cancer proteins. METHODS: Blood samples and breast tissue were collected from women undergoing first time breast augmentation (implant-naive [IN]) and revision breast augmentation (implant-exposed [IE]). Sera were collected and antibody levels to common breast cancer proteins were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed on breast tissue samples to quantify immune-related gene expression levels between IN and IE patients. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes and altered signaling pathways in the breasts of IN patients versus IE patients. RESULTS: In total, 188 patients were recruited (IN, n = 117; IE, n = 71). Data demonstrated that IE patients had higher levels of antibodies to mucin-1, estrogen receptor-α, and mammaglobin A compared with IN patients. Mucin-1 expression was found to be higher in IE compared with IN breast tissue. RNA- sequencing analysis demonstrated up-regulated pathways in IE breast tissue for B-cell activation and development, T-helper cell type 2-related genes, T-cell activation, chemotactic factors, and responses to estrogen. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that periimplant inflammation extends beyond the implant capsule to the breast parenchyma. Women with breast implants have more activated B cells in the breast parenchyma and elevated antibody responses to breast cancer antigen. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, V.",

    "AbstractText": "Five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients has increased to 12.8% afterthe initial diagnosis, still making it one of the deadliest cancertypes. This disease is known as the \"silent killer\" because early detection is challenging due to the location of the pancreas in the body and the nonspecific clinical symptoms. The Bossmann group has developed ultrasensitive nanobiosensors for protease/arginase detection comprised of Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, cyanine 5.5, and designer peptide sequences linked to TCPP. Initial data obtained from both gene expression analysis and protease/arginase activity detection in serum indicated the feasibility of early pancreatic cancer detection. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, -1, -3, and -9), cathepsins (CTS) B and E, neutrophil elastase, and urokinase plaminogen activator (uPA) have been identified as candidates for proximal biomarkers. In this study, we have confirmed our initial results from 2018 performing serum sample analysis assays using a larger group sample size (n = 159), which included localized (n=33) and metastatic pancreatic cancer (n=50), pancreatitis (n=26), and an age-matched healthy control group (n=50). The data obtained from the eight nanobiosensors capable of ultrasensitive protease and arginase activity measurements were analyzed by means of an optimized information fusion-based hierarchical decision structure. This permits the modeling of early-stage detection of pancreatic cancer as a multi-class classification problem. The most striking result is that this methodology permits the detection of localized pancreatic cancers from serum analyses with around 96% accuracy.",

    "AbstractText": "It is well established that Helicobacter pylori infection is a primary cause of gastritis. There is an alarming potential for this infection to progress into gastric cancer if left unaddressed. However, the efficacy of conventional treatments is undermined by the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance and the necessity for complex multidrug and high-dose therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, the presence of factors such as biofilm formation, efflux pumps, and gene mutations significantly elevates the risk of treatment failure. In view of these significant challenges, contemporary drug delivery systems represent a vital adjunct in the battle against H. pylori. These advanced and sophisticated systems offer significant advantages, including enhanced drug protection, controlled release, and targeted delivery to specific tissues. Nanoparticles, in particular, show promise in combating H. pylori infection through a variety of mechanisms, including direct drug delivery into the bacteria and the destruction of bacterial walls, as well as generation of free radicals. This review provides an overview of the current therapeutic landscape, including both existing and evolving treatment options. It delves into the transformative potential of novel drug delivery systems, including micro- and nanoparticles, to play a transformative role in the complex field of H. pylori infection treatment. By examining the complex relationship between infection dynamics and cutting-edge delivery technologies, this review seeks to identify avenues for more effective and targeted interventions against this persistent threat. As our understanding of H. pylori infection advances, new treatments and enhanced drug delivery methods offer the prospect of a more effective and personalized approach to combating this persistent health problem. This dynamic intersection of microbiology and nanotechnology exemplifies the relentless pursuit of innovative solutions to safeguard against the formidable challenges posed by H. pylori.

    "AbstractText": "The process of carcinogenesis is initiated by an excessive proliferation of tumor cells, accompanied by a reduction in the rate of apoptosis. A number of molecules are involved in this process, with Survivin being one such molecule that is known to control it. The expression of Survivin has been observed in a range of embryonic and adult tissues with a high rate of turnover, as well as in tissue sections of oral precancerous and cancerous lesions. However, data regarding the detection of Survivin in saliva are scarce. The aim of this study is to estimate and compare salivary Survivin levels (SSL) in normal oral mucosa (NOM), oral leukoplakia (OL), and squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in order to demonstrate its potential as a predictive biomarker. Whole saliva samples were collected from all subjects and assessed for salivary Survivin levels using the ELISA technique. A Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to ascertain any significant differences in SSL. The mean SSL in the control group was found to be 301.9±180.35 ng/dl, while the study groups of OL and OSCC exhibited mean values of 285±140.4 and 316.5±176.72 ng/dl, respectively. In the OL group, the highest value was observed in cases of severe dysplasia (407.4 ng/dl), while in the OSCC group, the highest value was noted in WDSCC (311.5 ng/dl). Due to the inconsistency in the distribution of the sample, our findings were found to be non-significant (p = 0.796). This study is the first to detect Survivin in normal oral mucosa (NOM). The results suggest that Survivin plays a definitive role in maintaining the normal homeostasis of oral mucosa. The gradual upregulation and downregulation of SSL in OL and OSCC can be used to predict the aggressive nature of the malignancy. Therefore, the detection of Survivin in saliva can be utilized as a predictive marker for the progression of oral precancerous and cancerous lesions.",

Clinical management presents unique considerations, including challenges in early detection and treatment strategies tailored to younger patients. Addressing EO-CRC requires a multidisciplinary approach integrating epidemiological, molecular, and clinical insights to improve prevention, diagnosis, and therapeutic outcomes. Emerging research avenues explore novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, offering promise for advancing understanding and management of this disease in contemporary oncology practice.",

    "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease accounts for ∼5% of all cases of CRC. Although it only accounts for a fraction of CRC cases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related CRC is a serious consequence of chronic inflammation that needs attention. There is a better understanding today about the pathogenesis contributing to IBD-CRC and the role of genetics and gut microbiota. Guidelines recommend timely screening and surveillance of UC and Crohn's patients, and it is usually timed from the initial diagnosis. This helps with early detection of dysplasia and CRC in this subset of patients, thus allowing for earlier intervention. However, dysplasia is not always easy to discern and management of CRC in each patient may differ. A multidisciplinary approach should be adopted in managing CRC in IBD. Although the oncologic principles of managing sporadic CRC and IBD-CRC are the same, surgical resection should be tailored to each patient.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The 2015 American Thyroid Association pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) guidelines recommend posttherapy whole body scan (PTS) 4-7 days after (Iodine-131) I-131 activity administration. There is no recommendation of timing of performing a diagnostic whole-body scan (Dx-WBS). However, this 4-7 day time frame for PTS lacks a solid basis and is essentially arbitrary. This is especially crucial as it has the potential to significantly impact patient management. Our primary goal in this study was to establish the optimal timing for both Dx-WBS and PTS in pediatric and young adult patients with DTC. METHODS: The DTC patients aged ≤21 years underwent serial whole-body scan (WBS) at 24 h, 48 h, and/or 72 h or more after the administration of diagnostic and therapeutic activities of I-131. The utility of Dx-WBS and PTS was assessed based on the identification of new lesions that could potentially influence the prescribed therapeutic activity of I-131. The optimal timing for acquiring Dx-WBS and PTS was determined based on when the first lesion appeared in the I-131 WBS. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (27 males and 68 females) with an average age of 17.9 ± 3 years received a 74 MBq I-131 for Dx-WBS. Ten patients (10.5%) showed no uptake in Dx-WBS, thus, no I-131 therapy was given. The remaining 85 patients received a therapeutic activity of 1.11-5.55 GBq I-131 based on the extent of their disease. The serial Dx-WBS or PTS showed no additional lesions in patients with thyroid remnants. However, additional nodes were detected in 2/32 patients in the ≥48 h Dx-WBS, and 1/32 patients in the known nodal disease patients, which were not clinically relevant. Importantly, 72 h PTS picked up pulmonary metastases in 17.6% (3 out of 17) of patients, which were missed in serial Dx-WBS. However, >72 h PTS did not have additional value. CONCLUSION: I-131 Dx-WBS is best to be performed at 48 h, and PTS at 72 h in pediatric and young adult patients with DTC.",

As a result, treatment strategies for this disease have received considerable attention. Research has highlighted the crucial role of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in the initiation and progression of BC, particularly in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, molecular targets within this pathway represent promising opportunities for the development of novel BC therapies. This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms by which natural compounds modulate the Hh signaling pathway in BC. By conducting a comprehensive review of various natural compounds, including polyphenols, terpenes, and alkaloids, we reveal both common and unique regulatory mechanisms that influence this pathway. This investigation represents the first comprehensive analysis of five distinct mechanisms through which natural compounds modulate key molecules within the Hh pathway and their impact on the aggressive behaviors of BC. Furthermore, by exploring the structure-activity relationships between these compounds and their molecular targets, we shed light on the specific structural features that enable natural compounds to interact with various components of the Hh pathway. These novel insights contribute to advancing the development and clinical application of natural compound-based therapeutics.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep learning-based classification of gallbladder lesions on US images in patients with non-diagnostic US secondary to gallbladder factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with non-diagnostic US due to calculi within the gallbladder lumen, obscuring the detailed evaluation, were identified by a research fellow from a prospective database of patients with gallbladder lesions. The US reports and images were evaluated by a radiologist blinded to the final diagnosis. Patients who had the final pathological diagnosis based on fine-needle aspiration cytology, percutaneous or endoscopic biopsy, or surgical histopathology were included. Convolution neural networks (ResNet50, GBCNet), transformer models (vision transformer [ViT], RadFormer), and a hybrid model (MedViT) were trained on a public gallbladder dataset (GBCU dataset). The performance of these models for classifying gallbladder lesions into benign and malignant was tested on non-diagnostic (GB-RADS 0) US images. RESULTS: Training and validation cohorts (GBCU dataset) comprised 1004 and 251 images, respectively. The testing data (26 patients, mean age [SD]: 57.5 ±8.07 years, 17 female) comprised 304 images. The best performance for detection of GBC was achieved with GBCNet (sensitivity 51.1%, specificity 83.3%, area under the curve [AUC] 0.709) and MedViT (sensitivity 92.8%, specificity 50%, AUC 0.714). MedViT had the best accuracy (73.1%) for detecting benign gallbladder lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that deep learning models can potentially stratify patients with non-diagnostic US.

    "AbstractText": "Solute carrier family 27 member 5 (SLC27A5/FATP5) is a liver-specific metabolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid transport and bile acid metabolism. Deficiency of SLC27A5 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. SLC27A5 exhibits noncanonical functions beyond its metabolic role; however, its specific mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis remain elusive and are therefore investigated in this study. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis showed that SLC27A5-interacting proteins were significantly enriched in alternative polyadenylation (APA). RNA-sequencing data provided evidence that SLC27A5 plays a global role in regulating APA events in HCC. Mechanistically, SLC27A5 facilitates the usage of the proximal polyadenylation site of METTL14 by downregulating the expression of the APA-associated factor PABPC1, resulting in the shortening of the METTL14-3'UTR and the conversion of METTL14-UL to METTL14-US. In contrast to METTL14-UL, METTL14-US escapes the inhibitory effect of miRNA targeting, leading to increased METTL14 expression. METTL14-US upregulation by SLC27A5 suppressed the stemness of HCC. Therefore, low levels of SLC27A5 and METTL14 may serve as reliable biomarkers for identifying poor prognosis in patients with HCC. In conclusion, SLC27A5/PABPC1 inhibits HCC stemness via APA-regulated expression of METTL14, providing potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

MYC plays a central role in carcinogenesis and is a key regulator of tumor development and drug resistance. Therefore, MYC is one of the most alluring therapeutic targets for developing cancer drugs. Although the search for direct inhibitors of MYC is challenging, MYC cannot simply be assumed to be undruggable. Targeting the MYC-MAX complex has been an effective method for directly targeting MYC. Alternatively, indirect targeting of MYC represents a more pragmatic therapeutic approach, mainly including inhibition of the transcriptional or translational processes of MYC, destabilization of the MYC protein, and blocking genes that are synthetically lethal with MYC overexpression. In this review, we delineate the multifaceted roles of MYC in cancer progression, highlighting a spectrum of therapeutic strategies and inhibitors for cancer therapy that target MYC, either directly or indirectly.",

Thus, it is of great significance to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HCC and seek biomarkers for early diagnosis. Neddylation, one of the most conserved post-translational modification types in eukaryotes, plays vital roles in the progression of HCC. During the process of neddylation, NEDD8 is covalently conjugated to its substrate proteins, thereby modulating multiple necessary biological processes. Currently, increasing evidence shows that the aberrant activation of neddylation is positively correlated with the occurrence and development of tumors and the poor clinical prognosis of HCC patients. Based on the current investigations, neddylation modification has been reported to target both the cullins and non-cullin substrates and subsequently affect HCC progression, including the virus infection, malignant transformation, tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability, and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, inhibitors targeting the neddylation cascade have been developed and entered clinical trials, indicating satisfactory anti-HCC treatment effects. This review aims to summarize the latest progress in the molecular mechanism of pathologically aberrant neddylation in HCC, as well as the advances of neddylation-targeted inhibitors as potential drugs for HCC treatment.",

The intricate balance of detoxification processes regulated by GSTs is pivotal in cellular homeostasis, whereby dysregulation in these mechanisms can have profound implications for human health. Certain GSTs neutralize carcinogens, shielding cells and potentially preventing tumorigenesis. Polymorphisms in specific GSTs may result in the accumulation of toxic metabolites, exacerbating oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, notably observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. They can also modulate signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, with aberrant activity potentially contributing to uncontrolled cell growth and resistance to cell death, thus promoting cancer development.

METHODS: This study used data from patients who used opioids during anticancer therapy at the Oita University Hospital between September 2014 and October 2023. The primary outcome measure was the amount of change in morphine mg equivalent opioid dose during the period of anticancer therapy. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce confounding effects. RESULTS: The study enrolled 235 patients; 101 received ICI and 134 received no ICI. Before propensity score matching, there were significant differences between the ICI and non-ICI groups in lines of anticancer therapy, type of primary cancer, body mass index, maximum opioid dose and the amount of change in opioid dose. Following propensity score matching, 73 patients each were included in the ICI and non-ICI groups. Analysis of the propensity score-matched cohort showed a significant increase in the median amount of change in opioid dose in ICI group vs non-ICI group (22.5 vs. 15.0 morphine mg equivalents, interquartile range; 0.0, 40.0 vs. 0.0, 30.0, P = .044). Multiple regression analysis identified ICI administration and body mass index as significant independent factors associated with the amount of change in opioid dose (P = .014 and .027, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ICI administration significantly increased opioid dosage regardless of patient background. Our findings would provide valuable insight into future pain management strategies.",

    "AbstractText": "Metastasis is a lethal disease of cancer, spreading from primary tumors to the bloodstream as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which disseminate to distant organs at low efficiency for secondary tumor regeneration, thereby contributing to unfavorable patient outcomes. The detection of dynamic CTC alterations can be indicative of cancer progression (residual cancer, aggressiveness, therapy resistance) or regression (therapy response), serving as biomarkers for diagnoses and prognoses. CTC heterogeneity is impacted by both intrinsic oncogenic changes and extrinsic microenvironmental factors (e.g. the immune system and circadian rhythm), altering the genomic/genetic, epigenomic/epigenetic, proteomic, post-translational, and metabolomic landscapes. In addition to homeostatic dynamics, regenerative stemness, and metabolic plasticity, a newly discovered feature of CTCs that influences metastatic outcomes is its intercellular clustering. While the dogma suggests that CTCs play solo as single cells in the circulation, CTCs can orchestrate with other CTCs or white blood cells to form homotypic or heterotypic multi-cellular clusters, with 20-100 times enhanced metastatic potential than single CTCs. CTC clusters promote cell survival and stemness through DNA hypomethylation and signaling pathways activated by clustering-driving proteins (CD44, CD81, ICAM1, Podocalyxin, etc). Heterotypic CTC clusters may protect CTCs from immune cell attacks if not being cleared by cytotoxic immune cells. This chapter mainly focused on CTC biology related to multi-omic features and metastatic outcomes. We speculate that CTCs could guide therapeutic targeting and be targeted specifically by anti-CTC therapeutics to reduce or eliminate cancer and cancer metastasis.",

Epigenetic alterations and especially DNA methylation have a high potential to provide valuable and innovative cancer biomarkers. Liquid biopsy is a unique minimally invasive tool for the management of cancer patients based on the extraction of information through detailed molecular analysis of circulating genetic material in peripheral blood and allows us to characterize the evolution of a solid tumor in real time. DNA methylation in combination with liquid biopsy is very powerful when it comes to providing circulating epigenetic biomarkers of clinical importance. Numerous DNA methylation markers are now being tested in liquid biopsies as potential biomarkers in various types of cancer. DNA methylation is mostly being studied in ctDNA but there are also a small number of studies up to now performed in gDNA isolated from CTCs. A highly important dimension of the combination of liquid biopsy/DNA methylation analysis is its high potential for early cancer detection since alterations in DNA methylation in plasma can be detected very early during cancer pathogenesis. Methylated DNA, modified nucleosomes and noncoding RNAs can be used as blood circulating epigenetic biomarkers for real-time and minimally-invasive cancer monitoring.

While the prognostic value of CTC enumeration in metastatic prostate cancer is established, there is a compelling need for molecular CTC characterization for effective patient stratification and disease management. The clinical utility of CTCs has been advanced by the evolution of enrichment technologies and their molecular characterization. Enrichment technologies have evolved from strictly EpCAM-based enrichment to antigen-agnostic enrichment, while their clinical utility has evolved from enumeration to advanced downstream analyses including CTC proteomics, transcriptomics and genomics. This chapter offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in CTC enrichment and analytical technologies while highlighting pivotal clinical studies in prostate cancer, that utilize CTCs to determine the molecular basis of clinical response and resistance, to assist in disease management and treatment customization.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Circulating tumor cells in lung cancer: Integrating stemness and heterogeneity to improve clinical utility.",
    "AbstractText": "Circulating tumor cells (CTC), released by primary tumors into the bloodstream, represent a valuable source to inform on cancer heterogeneity, cancer progression, metastatic disease and therapy efficacy without the need of invasive tumor biopsies. However, the extreme rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs, occurring at genotypic, phenotypic and functional levels, poses a major challenge for the study of this population and explains the lack of standardized strategies of CTC isolation. Lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, is a paradigmatic example of how CTC heterogeneity can undermine the clinical utility of this biomarker, since contrasting data have been reported using different isolation technologies. Some evidences suggest that only a fraction of CTC, characterized by stem-like feature and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, can sustain metastasis initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the potential to maintain primary tumors, initiate metastasis and escape both chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. Moreover, a close connection has been reported in several tumor types among hybrid phenotype, characterized by retention of epithelial and mesenchymal traits, acquisition of CSC feature and increased metastatic potential. This review focuses on the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CTCs and the resulting implications for their isolation and clinical validation, especially in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we discuss the most relevant studies providing evidence for the presence and prognostic/predictive value of CTC subsets characterized by stem-like and hybrid EMT phenotype. Despite technical and conceptual issues, tracking circulating CSCs has the potential to improve the prognostic/predictive value of CTCs in NSCLC setting and could provide novel insights into the comprehension of the metastatic process and identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

    "AbstractText": "Comparative oncology has made great strides in identifying patterns of cancer prevalence and risk across the tree of life. Such studies have often centered on elucidating the evolution of mechanisms that prevent the development and progression of cancer, especially in large animals such as elephants. Conclusions from this approach, however, may have been exaggerated, given that the deep evolutionary origins of multicellularity suggest that the preeminent functions of the identified mechanisms may be unrelated to cancer. Instead, cancer suppression may have emerged as an evolutionary byproduct, or \"spandrel\". We propose a novel evolutionary perspective that highlights the importance of somatic maintenance as the underlying axis of natural selection. We argue that by shifting the focus of study from cancer suppression to somatic maintenance, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary pressures that shaped the mechanisms responsible for the observed variation in cancer prevalence across species.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The role of RNA binding proteins in cancer biology: A focus on FMRP.",
    "AbstractText": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) act as crucial regulators of gene expression within cells, exerting precise control over processes such as RNA splicing, transport, localization, stability, and translation through their specific binding to RNA molecules. The diversity and complexity of RBPs are particularly significant in cancer biology, as they directly impact a multitude of RNA metabolic events closely associated with tumor initiation and progression. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), as a member of the RBP family, is central to the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome and increasingly recognized in the modulation of cancer biology through its influence on RNA metabolism. The protein's versatility, stemming from its diverse RNA-binding domains, enables it to govern a wide array of transcript processing events. Modifications in FMRP's expression or localization have been associated with the regulation of mRNAs linked to various processes pertinent to cancer, including tumor proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular senescence, chemotherapy/radiotherapy resistance, and immunotherapy evasion. In this review, we emphasize recent findings and analyses that suggest contrasting functions of this protein family in tumorigenesis. Our knowledge of the proteins that are regulated by FMRP is rapidly growing, and this has led to the identification of multiple targets for therapeutic intervention of cancer, some of which have already moved into clinical trials or clinical practice.",

SUMOylation affects various cell cycle regulators, including oncogenes, suggesting its relevance in cancer. SUMO E3 ligases are pivotal in this process, exhibiting diverse functionalities through structural domains and subcellular localizations. A less-explored SUMO E3 ligase, RANBP2, a component of the vertebrate nuclear pore complex, emerges as a central player in cellular cycle processes, as well as in tumorigenesis. The current studies illuminate the importance of RANBP2 and underscore the need for more extensive studies to validate its clinical applicability in neoplastic interventions. Our review elucidates the significance of RANBP2 across various types of malignancies. Additionally, it delves into exploring RANBP2 as a prospective therapeutic target for cancer treatment, offering insights into the avenues that scholars should pursue in their subsequent research endeavors.

    "ArticleTitle": "The meaning of \"total pain\" in the context of living and dying with dementia.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Globally, there are 55 million people living with dementia (PLWD). PLWD have an uncertain prognosis. Most are approaching the end of life but are not overtly or immediately dying. Contemporary approaches to dementia care therefore promote the need to live and die well with dementia. Pain is highly prevalent but difficult to manage in PLWD. Originating in palliative care, \"total pain\" conceives of pain holistically, incorporating biological, psychological, social and spiritual elements. Pain management in dementia care tends to be pharmacologically focused. Total pain therefore offers an alternative approach-one consistent with person-centred philosophy underpinning contemporary dementia care. Due to important differences, concepts cannot simply be extrapolated from cancer-related to dementia-related palliative care however. Dementia-specific approaches are needed and require exploration. DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE OF THE ANALYSIS: The objective of this paper is to explore the meaning of total pain in the context of living and dying with dementia, and its utility and implications for person-centred dementia care. Using a palliative care framework and existing literature, we critically consider the bio-psycho-socio-spiritual impact of dementia, to explore how total pain might manifest and be experienced in this context. FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION: We highlight the complexity, nuance and socially contingent nature of the impact of living and dying with dementia. We challenge binary understandings of \"continuity or loss\" (e.g., of identity, relationships), and totalising \"loss\" discourses, demonstrating that more subtle, varied and hopeful outcomes are possible. The way that the impact of dementia is articulated and understood has implications for the experience and management of total pain. The deficit-orientation of \"total pain\" paradoxically risks its perpetuation. A balanced understanding of dementia's impact (acknowledging both continuity and loss, alternatives and socially constructed aspects) better reflects the realities of dementia and creates new possibilities for supportive care practices to improve pain management and quality of life. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Applied to dementia care, \"total pain\" should be located within a critical context, emphasising complexity, contingency and nuance. The holistic focus of \"total pain\" should be extended to incorporate balanced consideration of \"painful\" and \"functional\" experience. We introduce a balanced model of total pain incorporating a dual focus on \"pain\" and \"personhood\" within a critical context, to facilitate translation to practice. There is a need to develop evidence-based supportive interventions in each domain of total pain, to support a balanced approach to total pain management in dementia care.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A breast cancer patient with chemotherapy-induced chronic lymphocytic myocarditis successfully treated with steroid therapy.",
    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: A 63-year-old female patient with a history of postoperative recurrence of breast cancer after radiation therapy underwent chemotherapy with epirubicin (total 960 mg) and low-dose cyclophosphamide. She developed acute decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Despite initial treatment with diuretics and inotropic drugs, her condition worsened, leading to low-output syndrome and frequent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient underwent an endomyocardial biopsy and catheter ablation for AF. The endomyocardial biopsy revealed predominant lymphocyte invasion rather than cardiomyocyte injury, indicating drug-induced chronic lymphocytic myocarditis. The clinical course and biopsy findings indicated that other potential causes were unlikely, such as viral infection, collagen disease, and immune checkpoint inhibitor use. Following steroid pulse therapy, maintenance therapy with a starting dose of 80 mg of methylprednisolone (mPSL) led to a significant improvement in hemodynamics, resulting in her discharge on the 82nd day with an improved ejection fraction from 20 % to 42 %. A second endomyocardial biopsy under 20 mg of mPSL showed a marked improvement in lymphocytic infiltration. This case serves to illustrate the significance of endomyocardial biopsy in the context of refractory heart failure with an onco-cardiology case, whereby an appropriate diagnosis can be made and successful steroid therapy can be initiated. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Although heart failure after chemotherapy is frequently reported, reports of chronic lymphocytic myocarditis after chemotherapy are relatively uncommon. Endomyocardial biopsy has enabled the differential diagnosis of cardiac toxicity and has led to the diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis. Currently, the optimal treatment for chronic lymphocytic myocarditis remains unestablished. However, in this case, it was found that steroid therapy was effective.",

The secondary objective of the study was to investigate whether CLUE played a role in the treatment response and to examine its correlation with the other measures of lymphedema. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2019 and June 2019, a total of 40 patients (2 males, 38 females; mean age: 57.8±12.5 years; range, 45 to 70 years) who were diagnosed with unilateral Stage 2-3 BCRL and underwent treatment were included. The patients' upper extremity volumes were assessed and the patients were evaluated with the CLUE score, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Outcome Measure (QuickDASH) score, BIS, and hand grip strength before and after the complete decongestive therapy. RESULTS: Correlation analyses revealed that CLUE total score and BIS values were correlated with the reduction in the volumes (p=0.04 and p<0.001, respectively). The CLUE total score was also found to be positively correlated with the BIS values (p<0.001). Hand grip strength and QuickDASH scores were not found to be correlated with the changes in the volume and CLUE total scores. CONCLUSION: The development of a structured clinical assessment such as CLUE provides clinicians for a standardized evaluation for BCRL. The diagnosis of subclinical lymphedema can be detected earlier by using the BIS and CLUE scale and lymphedema comorbidity and treatment costs can be reduced.",

Sociodemographic information of the caregivers and information about the cancer diagnosis of the patients were recorded. The anxiety level of the caregivers was assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), hopelessness level with the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and quality of life with the Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CQOL-C). RESULTS: There was no statistically meaningful difference between the caregivers of patients with and without lymphedema and the control group regarding anxiety (p=0.818). The hopelessness level was higher in caregivers of patients with lymphedema compared to healthy controls (p=0.011). No statistically meaningful difference was found in CQOL-C burden, disruptiveness, positive adaptation, or financial concerns subscales in caregivers of patients with and without lymphedema (p=0.697, p=0.209, p=0.823, p=0.855, and p=0.257, respectively). Continuous caregiving was negatively associated with the total CQOL-C score in caregivers of patients with lymphedema (p=0.031). Complex decongestive therapy was negatively associated with high BAI and BHS scores (p=0.038 and p=0.034, respectively). CONCLUSION: Lymphedema has a negative impact on hopelessness, while complex decongestive therapy has positive effects on anxiety and depression. Continuous caregiving may be considered a risk factor for high total CQOL-C scores.",

    "AbstractText": "Ionic liquids (ILs), traditionally considered environmentally benign solvents, have shown potential toxicity to organisms, raising concerns about their safety. Among them, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium (M8OI) has been detected at high concentrations in soils and exhibits hepatotoxic properties. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this toxicity, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed, coupled with benchmark dose (BMD) modeling, to derive transcriptomic points-of-departure (tPOD) through dose-response analysis. The transcriptomic analysis identified 425, 667, and 567 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low (10 μmol/L), medium (50 μmol/L), and high (200 μmol/L) doses of M8OI exposure, respectively. Enrichment analysis revealed significant perturbations in pathways related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and IL-17 signaling. BMD modeling yielded tPOD values of 1.51 μmol/L (median of the 20 most sensitive genes, omicBMD20), 2.98 μmol/L (tenth percentile of all genes, omicBMD10th), 6.83 μmol/L (mode of the first peak of all gene BMDs, omicBMDmode), and 5.9 μmol/L for pathway-level analysis. These transcriptomics-derived tPODs were at least 105-fold lower than M8OI's hepatotoxic concentration, as indicated by its EC50 of 723.6 μmol/L in HepG2 cells. Functional analysis of the transcriptomic data identified legionellosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer as the most sensitive pathways affected by M8OI. These findings highlight the molecular mechanisms driving M8OI-induced hepatotoxicity and underscore the utility of transcriptomics in deriving sensitive and quantitative toxicity thresholds. The results provide critical insights for guideline-driven toxicological evaluations and regulatory decision-making, supporting a more comprehensive assessment of IL safety.",

This study was aimed at reporting esophageal cancer incidence trend in 2009-2019 and its prediction to 2030. METHODS: The burden of esophageal cancer in Jiangsu in 2019 was estimated using 54 cancer registries' data selected from Jiangsu Cancer Registry. Incident cases of 16 cancer registries were applied for the temporal trend from 2009 to 2019. The burden of esophageal cancer by 2030 was projected using the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model. RESULTS: About 24,886 new cases of esophageal cancer (17,233 males and 7,653 females) occurred in Jiangsu in 2019. Rural regions of Jiangsu had the highest incidence rate. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR, per 100,000 population) of esophageal cancer in Jiangsu decreased from 27.72 per 100,000 in 2009 to 14.18 per 100,000 in 2019. The BAPC model showed that the ASIR would decline from 13.01 per 100,000 in 2020 to 4.88 per 100,000 in 2030. CONCLUSIONS: According to the data, esophageal cancer incidence rates were predicted to decline until 2030, yet the disease burden is still significant in Jiangsu. The existing approaches to prevention and control are effective and need to be maintained.",

This study aimed to systematically summarize the global application of ctDNA in the prognostic management of solid tumor patients and to evaluate the quality of the current studies. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and clinical trials.gov databases were searched to collect cohort studies on ctDNA in the prognosis of solid tumor patients from January 2016 to May 2022. The language was limited to English. Information including general information, participants and cancer characteristics, ctDNA and outcome information were extracted. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist. RESULTS: A total of 214 studies were included in the final analysis, encompassing 21,076 patients. The number of studies has increased annually from 2016 to 2022. The most common types of solid tumors studied were colorectal cancer (27.10 %), lung cancer (20.09 %), pancreatic cancer (16.82 %), and breast cancer (14.02 %). The top three journals by number of publications had an impact factor in 2023 greater than 10. Of the studies, the median sample size was 69 (interquartile range: 41-111), 69.81 % had a sample size <100, 68.92 % had a median/mean age ≥60 years, and 74.05 % were from developed countries.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trend of major malignant tumor mortality in Shandong Province, eastern China from 1970 to 2021, and to provide the scientific basis for malignant tumor prevention and control. METHODS: Cancer mortality data were sourced from three nationwide cause-of-death surveys and the Shandong Death Registration System. Trends in overall mortality and major causes of death were elucidated through indicators such as mortality rates and age-adjusted death rates, by comparing findings from the three comprehensive mortality surveys and the Shandong Death Registration System. The difference decomposing method was employed to estimate the contributions of non-demographic and demographic factors to the observed changes in cancer mortality. RESULTS: From 1970 to 2021, the crude mortality rate of malignant tumors witnessed an overall increase in Shandong Province. The age-standardized mortality rate initially rose before subsequently declining. The proportion of cancer deaths among all causes of death increased initially and then stabilized at a high level of approximately 25 %. Both non-demographic and demographic factors played a role in the rise of the crude cancer mortality rate, with the proportion attributed to demographic factors gradually surpassing that of non-demographic factors. Despite the continuous increase in the crude mortality rate, the adjusted mortality rate exhibited a downward trend since 1990. Significant changes were observed in the ranking of the mortality rates of major cancers. For example, the mortality rate of lung cancer exhibited a continuous upward trajectory, ascending from the fifth to the first place and marking a 7.69-fold increase from 1970 to 2021. Conversely, digestive system tumors, including gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and liver cancer, displayed varying degrees of decline, particularly in the standardized rates, which demonstrated a notable downward trend since 1990. The crude mortality rate of colorectal cancer and breast cancer showed an obvious upward trend, but the standardized rate did not rise significantly. For cervical cancer, both the crude and adjusted mortality rates displayed a pattern of initially decreasing and then increasing. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant tumors remain a significant threat to the residents of Shandong Province. The changing trends in various malignant tumors are inconsistent, underscoring the need for tailored intervention strategies to effectively control different types of malignant tumors.",

Here, we aimed to examine whether IDO1 activity is correlated with OS in NSCLC patients with brain metastasis (Bramet) and has negative effect on modulating the anti-tumor functions of immune cells. METHODS: This study was a part of a prospective clinical trial in circulating biomarkers. Blood or tissues from eligible participants were collected for measurement of kynurenine, tryptophan, immune cell subtype, scRNA-seq analysis, and untargeted metabolomics analysis. RESULTS: A total of 195 patients were enrolled. The median kynurenine to tryptophan (K:T) ratio was 0.18, with consistent values observed among patients with NSCLC Bramet and those without (0.18 and 0.11, respectively). Notably, student's t-test analysis revealed significantly higher kynurenine concentrations in stage IV patients compared to those in stage I (2.3 vs 1.7 µM, P < 0.001). In patients with Bramet, both kynurenine concentrations and K:T ratios were significantly elevated in comparison with those of extra-cerebral metastasis (2.7 vs 1.9 µM, P < 0.001; 0.12 vs 0.095, P = 0.028; respectively). Single-cell analysis further validated a high level of IDO1 expression in stage IV tumors or Bramet lesions, particularly in macrophages, regulated by chemokines such as CXCL11. Additionally, K:T ratios exhibited significant associations with Treg cell percentages and OS in patients with Bramet (P = 0.039). Treatment with kynurenine led to the upregulation of immune-suppressive molecules, including PD-1, in T cells. Finally, untargeted metabolomics analysis further identified that, apart from the IDO1 metabolic pathway, other metabolites, such as those involved in phospholipid pathways, were also implicated in Bramet. CONCLUSION: IDO1 metabolites may play immune-suppressive roles in NSCLC patients with Bramet.",

METHODS: Lifetime risk was estimated using the Adjusted for Multiple Primaries (AMP) method, incorporating cancer incidence, mortality, and all-cause mortality data from 55 cancer registries in Henan Province, China. Estimates were calculated overall and stratified by gender and area. The annual percent change (APC) in lifetime risk from 2010 to 2020, stratified by gender and cancer site, was estimated using a log-linear model. RESULTS: In 2020, the lifetime risk of developing and dying from cancer was 30.19 % (95 % CI: 29.63 %-30.76 %) and 23.62 % (95 % CI: 23.28 %-23.95 %), respectively. These estimates were higher in men, with values of 31.22 % (95 % CI: 30.59 %-31.85 %) for developing cancer and 26.73 % (95 % CI: 26.29 %-27.16 %) for dying from cancer, compared with women, who had values of 29.02 % (95 % CI: 28.12 %-29.91 %) and 20.08 % (95 % CI: 19.51 %-20.64 %), respectively. There were also geographical differences, with higher estimates in urban areas compared with rural areas. Residents had the highest lifetime risk of developing lung cancer, with a rate of 6.94 %, followed by breast cancer (4.14 %), stomach cancer (3.95 %), esophageal cancer (3.75 %), and liver cancer (2.86 %). Similarly, the highest lifetime risk of dying from cancer was observed for the following sites: lung (5.99 %), stomach (3.60 %), esophagus (3.39 %), liver (2.78 %), and colorectum (1.55 %). Overall, the lifetime risk of developing cancer increased, with an APC of 0.75 % (P < 0.05). Varying trends were observed across different cancer sites. There were gradual decreases in nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, and liver cancers. Conversely, increasing trends were noted for most other sites, with the highest APCs observed in thyroid, prostate, lymphoma, kidney, and gallbladder cancers. CONCLUSION: The lifetime risks of developing and dying from cancer were 30.19 % and 23.62 %, respectively.

Observational studies and randomized clinical trials reporting on ctDNA and prognostic outcomes in CRC patients were included. Pooled hazard risk ratios (HRs) were calculated for the primary outcomes, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Random-effects models were preferred considering the potential heterogeneity. RESULTS: Sixty-five cohort studies were included. Association between ctDNA and shorter RFS or OS was significant, especially after the full-course treatment recommended by the guidelines (HR = 8.92 [ 95 % CI: 6.02-13.22], P < 0.001, I2 = 73 %; HR = 3.05 [ 95 % CI: 1.72-5.41], P < 0.001, I2 = 48 %) for all types of CRC patients. Despite the presence of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses showed that the cancer type and ctDNA detection assays may be the underlying cause. Besides, ctDNA may detect recurrence earlier than radiographic progression, but no uniform sampling time point between studies might bring bias. However, ctDNA detection did not appear to correlate with pathological complete response achievement in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. CONCLUSION: ctDNA detection was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. The potential applications in prognostic prediction are promising and remain to be evaluated in other fields.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to formulate Citrus limon fruit rind's essential oil (EO) and to analyze its impact on breast cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, the cytotoxicity of EO (0.09-9 µg/ml) and doxorubicin (0.5-5 µM) on MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was assessed using the MTT assay following 24-72 hr treatment. The cells were then treated with niosomes containing 4.5 µg/ml EO and 0.5 µM doxorubicin for 48 hr. Flow cytometry, migration assay, and RT-qPCR were used to study the cell behavior. RESULTS: MTT results indicated that both EO and doxorubicin alone exhibited severe cytotoxicity (viability ≤ 30%) towards all three cells after 48 hr . When treated with encapsulated EO, the apoptotic death rate in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells was substantially diminished to 14%, 28%, and 9%, respectively. Similarly, encapsulated doxorubicin induced mild apoptotic death in these cells. Encapsulated EO and doxorubicin significantly prevented the migration of all cells. Following treatment with the encapsulated EO, a notable reduction in the expression of VIM, SLUG, SNAIL, and JUN, which are promoters of cancer cell invasion, was seen. Conversely, the expression of the FAS receptor, an active participant in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, increased (p˂0.01). CONCLUSION: Lemon EO has apoptotic and anti-migratory effects on breast cancer cells, comparable to that of doxorubicin. Utilizing niosome as an efficient delivery modality effectively mitigates the adverse effects of EO and can be used for in vivo delivery of it to cancer cells.",

METHODS: A total of 75 male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups: normal control group (NC), model group (MODEL), low-dose BXD treatment group (L-BXD), high-dose BXD treatment (H-BXD) group and MS treatment group (MS). BXD and MS were used in CRC mice at the doses of 3.915 g/kg, 15.66 g/kg, 0.6 g/kg for 3 weeks consecutively. Histopathological changes in the colon were observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The content of inflammatory factors in serum was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the expression of mRNA and protein of genes related to immunity, apoptosis, inflammation, and inflammatory factors was evaluated. Changes in the intestinal flora of mouse fecal were determined based on high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA microbial gene. RESULTS: Compared to the model group, the low-dose BXD and high-dose BXD groups decreased the number of colon tumors, reversed weight loss, and shortened colon length of mice. The pathological examination showed that BXD alleviated the malignancy of intestinal tumors. It also suppressed signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) expression, while increasing the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in colon tissues. Additionally, the levels of key pathway proteins involved in inflammation (phosphorylated-STAT3, Bcl-2, COX-2) and cell cycle regulatory molecules (c-Myc and PCNA) were reduced. According to 16S rRNA sequence analysis, BXD enhanced the relative abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria, while that of cancer-related bacteria decreased. CONCLUSION: BXD plays a preventive role in developing colorectal cancer; its mechanisms are related to the inhibition of inflammation and tumor proliferation, as well as maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.",

Failure to take basic oral and dental hygiene measures not only damages the health of teeth and gums, but can also significantly increase the risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Entamoeba gingivalis and Trichomonas tenax are reported to be anaerobic parasites found in the human mouth. These parasites are transmitted through saliva, contaminated food containers, drinking water, and/or other utensils. Since the observance of personal hygiene and discipline in taking care of oral and dental health is less in children and this affects their performance in school and their future success, we aimed to evaluate a parasitological and molecular survey of E. gingivalis and T. tenax among children (2 to 15 years) in Lorestan Province, in western Iran. This descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted from October 2021 to October 2022 on 660 children (aged 2-15 years) referred to health centers of Lorestan Province, Iran. The total prevalence of the parasites was 108 (16.4%) and 117 (17.7%) by microscopy and PCR, respectively. No significant association was reported among age (P=0.716), gender (P=0.289), parental education (P=0.812), tooth brushing (P=0.170), and prevalence of these parasites in children. Conversely, a significant association was reported between settling in rural areas (P=0.002), mouthwash (P=0.001), and the prevalence of these parasites in children. By multivariate test, settling in rural districts (P=0.007) and mouthwash (P<0.001) were considerably associated with the rate of these parasites.

    "AbstractText": "Globally, skin cancer is a main public health challenge whose incidence is continuously increasing. Given the limitations of conventional t herapies, new research and novel therapies may be promising for reducing skin cancer morbidity and mortality. Phytochemicals are attractive resources for new therapy design in cancer research due to their cost-effectiveness and lower side effects. In the present study, the anti-cancer activity of Oliveria decumbens (O. decumbens) extract was investigated on the human skin cancer A431 cell line A431. The aqueous extract of the O. decumbens plant was prepared using the traditional method. Then IC50 was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay under different concentrations of O. decumbens. Cell apoptosis was investigated by Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Cell cycle was investigated by PI staining and flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was analyzed by DCFH-DA (2', 7' -dichlorofluorescein-diacetate) staining and flowcytometry.IC50 for cell viability was determined 475g/ml. Cell cycle analyses showed G1 arrest in treated cells compared to control cell. Results also confirmed significant increase of apoptotic cells (8.2%1, P<0.05) under IC50 concentration of the extract in comparison to the control group (2.50.99%). A significant increase in ROS level was observed in O.ecumbens treated cells compared to control cells (738 170 vs 31655 in the control group, P<0.05.).Overall, the present results indicate that O. decumbens extract can inhibit skin cancer cell proliferation via inhibition of cell cycle and apoptosis. It seems that ROS production plays a critical role in the anticancer effect of O. decumbens extract. Therefore, its potential option for future treatment of skin cancer should be considered.",

    "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor threatening women's health. Alteration in lipid metabolism plays an important role in the occurrence and development of many diseases, including breast cancer. The uptake, synthesis, and catabolism of lipids in breast cancer cells are significantly altered, among which the metabolism of fatty acids, cholesterols, sphingolipids, and glycolipids are most significantly changed. The growth, progression, metastasis, and drug resistance of breast cancer cells are tightly correlated with the increased uptake and biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterols and the up-regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Cholesterol and its metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol promote the progression of breast cancer in a variety of ways. The alteration of lipid metabolism could promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells and lead to changes in the tumor immune microenvironment that are conducive to the survival of cancer cells. While the accumulation of ceramide in cancer cells shows an inhibitory effect on breast cancer. This review focuses on lipid metabolism and elaborates on the research progress of the correlation between different lipid metabolism and the growth, progression, and drug resistance of breast cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Partial nephrectomy (PN) is considered the gold standard surgical treatment for renal masses < 7cm in size (T1 tumors). Since the introduction of the robotic-assisted laparoscopic PN (raPN) in high-volume centers, it has been increasingly adapted and standardized by urologists worldwide. There is growing evidence that the robot-assisted laparoscopic technique is associated with superior outcomes compared to those of open and conventional laparoscopic techniques. This study aimed to summarize the contemporary outcome data of raPN for renal tumors with varying degrees of complexity and to assess whether the outcomes reported from high-volume centers are reproducible in a limited caseload setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of a single surgeon's experience, including 123 consecutive patients undergoing raPN at our institution. Ultimately, 110 patients were included in the analysis. Basic characteristics, tumor complexity as described by the RENAL score, complications described by the Clavien-Dindo classification system, and functional and oncological outcomes were assessed and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 27 (24%), 61 (55%), and 23 (21%) had low, intermediate, and high degrees of complexity, respectively, according to the RENAL score. A cancer-negative surgical margin was achieved in 108 (97%) patients. A total of 70 (64%) patients had no loss of renal function, while 20 (27%) had minimal loss of renal function. Complications of > 3 Clavien-Dindo classification during the first 30 postoperative days occurred in 5 (5%) patients. The 3 complexity groups were found to have significantly different ischemia time: Low, 8 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 8-9.5); Intermediate, 12 minutes (IQR, 10-13); and High, 15.5 minutes (IQR, 11.25-18.75) (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary standards for raPN are safe and reproducible. Adherence to the technique reported by centers of excellence yielded comparable results with regard to tumor control, preservation of renal function, and complication rates in lower-volume settings.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 12,471 patients diagnosed with T1bN0M0 RCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2010 and 2019. Patients were divided into the PN and RN groups, and propensity score matching was conducted to balance the differences between the groups. We compared overall survival (OS), RCC cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and noncancer-specific mortality (NCSM) between the 2 groups. The risk factors for all-cause and RCC-related mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, there were 3817 patients in each group. After matching, OS and NCSM were significantly longer in the PN group (p < 0.001); however, there was no significant between-group difference in the RCC-CSM. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the PN group (HR, 0.671; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.579-0.778, p < 0.001), but PN was not associated with lower RCC-related mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that PN reduced the HR of all-cause mortality by 35% (HR, 0.647; 95% CI, 0.536-0.781; p < 0.001) in patients with 4.0- to 5.5-cm tumors compared with RN and by 29% (HR, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.559-0.899; p = 0.004) in those with larger tumors (5.6-7.0 cm). Multifactorial analysis showed that PN was an independent predictor of OS (HR, 0.671; 95% CI, 0.579-0.778; p < 0.001). In addition, multivariate analysis validated that age at diagnosis, sex, pathological grade, and tumor size were associated with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T1b RCC, PN resulted in better OS and NCSM outcomes than RN. The benefit of PN in all-cause mortality was pronounced in patients with 4.0-5.5 cm tumor loads.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the lethal cancers, indicating the need for the identification of novel biomarkers for the detection of patients in earlier stages. RNA and microRNA sequencing were analyzed using bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by validation in CRC patients. METHODS: The genome-wide RNA sequencing of 631 samples, comprising 398 patients and 233 normal cases was extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The DEGs were identified using DESeq package in R. Survival analysis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to identify prognostic biomarkers. Predictive biomarkers were determined by machine learning algorithms such as Deep learning, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. The biological pathways, protein-protein interaction (PPI), the co-expression of DEGs, and the correlation between DEGs and clinical data were evaluated. Additionally, the diagnostic markers were assessed with a combioROC package. Finally, the candidate tope score gene was validated by Real-time PCR in CRC patients. RESULTS: The survival analysis revealed five novel prognostic genes, including KCNK13, C1orf174, CLEC18A, SRRM5, and GPR89A. Thirty-nine upregulated, 40 downregulated genes, and 20 miRNAs were detected by SVM with high accuracy and AUC. The upregulation of KRT20 and FAM118A genes and the downregulation of LRAT and PROZ genes had the highest coefficient in the advanced stage. Furthermore, our findings showed that three miRNAs (mir-19b-1, mir-326, and mir-330) upregulated in the advanced stage. C1orf174, as a novel gene, was validated using RT-PCR in CRC patients. The combineROC curve analysis indicated that the combination of C1orf174-AKAP4-DIRC1-SKIL-Scan29A4 can be considered as diagnostic markers with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values of 0.90, 0.94, and 0.92, respectively. CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms can be used to Identify key dysregulated genes/miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of diseases, leading to the detection of patients in earlier stages.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The immunosuppressive context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a significant hurdle in breast cancer (BC) treatment. Combinational therapies targeting cancer core signaling pathways involved in the induction of TME immunosuppressive milieu have emerged as a potent strategy to overcome immunosuppression in TME and enhance patient therapeutic outcomes. This study presents compelling evidence that targeting hypoxia-inducible-factor-1 alpha (Hif-1α) alongside chemotherapy and immune-inducing factors leads to substantial anticancer effects through modulation of TME. METHODS: Chitosan (Cs)/Hif-1alpha siRNA nano-complex was synthesized by siRNA adsorption methods. Nanoparticles were fully characterized using dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscope. Cs/Hif-1α siRNA cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay. The anticancer effects of the combinational therapy were assessed in BALB/c bearing 4T1 tumors. qPCR and western blotting were applied to assess the expression of some key genes and proteins involved in the induction of immunosuppression in TME. RESULTS: Hif-1α siRNA was successfully loaded in chitosan nanoparticles. Hif-1α siRNA nanocomplexes significantly inhibited the expression of Hif-1α. Triple combination therapy (Paclitaxel (Ptx) + Imiquimod (Imq) + Cs/Hif-1α siRNA) inhibited tumor growth and downregulated cancer progression genes while upregulating cellular-immune-related cytokines. Mice without Cs/Hif-1α siRNA treatments revealed fewer cancer inhibitory effects and more TME immunosuppressive factors. These results suggest that the inhibition of Hif-1α effects synergize with Ptx and Imq to inhibit cancer progression more significantly than other combinational treatments. CONCLUSION: Combining Hif-1α siRNA with Ptx and Imq is promising as a multimodality treatment. It has the potential to attenuate TME inhibitory effects and significantly enhance the immune system's ability to combat tumor cell growth, offering an inspiration of hope in the fight against BC.",

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess the influence of Thalidomide therapy on the maturation and stimulation of monocyte-derived DCs, and subsequently examine the consequences of these treated DCs on the immune responses of autologous T cells. METHODS: The immature DCs derived from monocytes were subjected to exposure to Thalidomide and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the fifth day of differentiation, followed by a 24-hour incubation period. On the sixth day, the phenotypic features of the DCs in both the control and treatment groups were assessed using flow cytometry. Subsequently, the gene expression in both the DCs and autologous T cells co-cultured with the DCs was evaluated using the real-time PCR method. RESULTS: Thalidomide-treated DCs exhibited a significant augmentation in the expression of maturation and stimulatory surface markers CD11c, HLA-DR, and CD86 (P ≤ 0.01), as well as gene expression of TNF-α and IL-12 (P ≤ 0.01) when compared to the control group. Furthermore, co-culture of Thalidomide-treated DCs with T cells increased T-bet and IFN-γ (P ≤ 0.01) expression, while diminished FOXP3 and TGF-β (P ≤ 0.01) expression compared to T cells co-cultured with untreated DCs. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that in vitro Thalidomide treatment shifts DCs towards an immunogenic state and elevates their T helper 1 inducing capacity, which may be efficient in immunotherapy of various cancers.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The role of tumor microenvironment and self-organization in cancer progression: Key insights for therapeutic development.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, influencing tumor initiation, growth, invasion, metastasis, and response to therapies. This study explores the dynamic interactions within the TME, particularly focusing on self-organization-a process by which tumor cells and their microenvironment reciprocally shape one another, leading to cancer progression and resistance. Understanding these interactions can reveal new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets within the TME, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) components, immune cells, and cytokine signaling pathways. METHODS: A comprehensive search method was employed to investigate the current academic literature on TME, particularly focusing on self-organization in the context of cancer progression and resistance across the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. RESULTS: Recent studies suggest that therapies that disrupt TME self-organization could improve patient outcomes by defeating drug resistance and increasing the effectiveness of conventional therapy. Additionally, this research highlights the essential of understanding the biophysical properties of the TME, like cytoskeletal alterations, in the development of more effective malignancy therapy. CONCLUSION: This review indicated that targeting the ECM and immune cells within the TME can improve therapy effectiveness. Also, by focusing on TME self-organization, we can recognize new therapeutic plans to defeat drug resistance.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Is high AFP associated with liver diseases in ataxia-telangiectasia and ataxia-oculomotor apraxia?",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) are both autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias characterized by elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. However, the source and clinical implications of this increase, as well as its relationship with liver diseases are unknown. In this study, we investigated the frequency of liver diseases and their relationship with high AFP in patients with AT and AOA2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 19 adult patients (13 patients with AT and 6 patients with AOA2) who were followed between January 1992 and March 2023. The demographic and clinical characteristics, serum levels of liver enzymes and AFP, liver imaging, and survival data were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 26.8±5.1 years (11 men and 8 women).While 69% (9/13) of AT patients had elevated liver enzymes and 56% (5/9) had abnormal liver imaging, both were normal in all AOA2 patients.Liver enzyme elevation was associated with the presence of comorbid disease (p=0.007), but not with AFP level (p=0.33) in AT patients. Hepatosteatosis was not associated neither with comorbidity (p=0.524) nor AFP level (p=0.905) in this group. During a median follow-up of 17 (1-29) years, 5 AT patients passed away due to cancer (4 patients) and sepsis (1 patient). AFP level was not associated with the occurrence of cancer (p=0.382). CONCLUSION: This study found a high prevalence of liver disease (69%) in AT, unlike in AOA, independent of AFP levels. Since comorbid diseases, especially cancer, were associated with elevated liver enzymes, adult AT patients with abnormal liver functions should be screened for the development of cancers.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Despite its prognostic impact, nutritional status has not yet been integrated into the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated the association between geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC using a nationwide registry. METHODS: Data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry between 2008 and 2019 were analyzed. We explored the integration of the GNRI with the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade for prognostic stratification. Restricted cubic spline regression was used to assess the association between GNRI and survival, stratified by ALBI grade. RESULTS: Among the 16,416 treatment-naïve HCC patients, the ALBI grades were distributed as follows: grade 1, 7,409; grade 2, 7,445; and grade 3, 1,562. Patients were categorized according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages: 5,132 stage 0/A, 2,608 stage B, 5,289 stage C, and 968 stage D. The median OS for all patients was 3.1 years (95% CI: 3.0-3.2) and significantly differed with the inclusion of ALBI grade and GNRI (p < 0.001). The effect of combining ALBI grade and GNRI was further evaluated for each BCLC stage. This risk stratification showed a significant correlation with OS for each BCLC stage (all p < 0.001), except for stage D (p = 0.082). Multivariate analysis revealed that a combination of favorable ALBI grade and high GNRI score was independently associated with decreased mortality risk. CONCLUSION: The GNRI was significantly correlated with OS across ALBI grades and BCLC stages. Integrating the GNRI into the ALBI grade may enhance risk stratification for patients with HCC.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Transarterial radioembolisation (RE) using yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres is a widely used locoregional therapy for a broad spectrum of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) given its favourable safety profile. We evaluated the real-world outcomes of unresectable HCC treated with resin Y-90 RE and the relationship between tumour absorbed dose and subsequent curative therapy with survival. METHODS: Included were consecutive patients treated with Y-90 resin microspheres RE for unresectable HCC between January 2008 and May 2019 at the National Cancer Centre Singapore/Singapore General Hospital. The outcomes were stratified by tumour burden, distribution, presence of portal vein invasion (PVI) and liver function to improve prognostication. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) evaluated on 413 included patients was 20.9 months (95% CI: 18.2-24.0). More than half of the patients (214/413, 51.8%) had HCC beyond up-to-seven criteria, and 37.3% had portal vein invasion (154/413, 37.3%). Majority (71.7%) had dosimetry calculated based on the partition model. Patients who received ≥150 Gy to tumour had significantly better outcomes (OS 32.2 months, 95% CI: 18.3-46.4) than those who did not (OS 17.5 months, 95% CI: 13.7-22.7, p < 0.001). Seventy patients (17%) received curative therapies after tumour was downstaged by Y-90 RE and had better OS of 79.7 months (95% CI: 40.4 - NE) compared to those who did not receive curative therapies (OS 17.1 months; 95% CI: 13.5-20.4, p < 0.001). RE-induced liver injury was observed in 5.08% of the patients while 3.2% of the patients had possible radiation pneumonitis but none developed Grade 3-4 toxicity. For HCC without PVI, OS differed significantly with performance status, albumin-bilirubin grade, tumour distribution, and radiation dose; for HCC with PVI, Child-Pugh class and AFP were significant predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment outcomes for unresectable HCC using Y-90 RE were favourable. Incorporating tumour burden and distribution improved prognostication. Patients who received tumour absorbed dose above 150 Gy had better OS. Patients who subsequently received curative therapies after being downstaged by Y-90 RE had remarkable clinical outcomes.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Proteinuria presents a challenging complication during systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to identify risk factors for proteinuria in patients with HCC treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo/Bev) or lenvatinib (LEN) as first-line systemic treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 622 consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who received Atezo/Bev or LEN as first-line systemic treatment between October 2013 and October 2022. Cumulative incidence of proteinuria was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using log-rank tests. Risk factors for proteinuria were identified using Cox proportional-hazard models, along with propensity score-matched and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Among 367 patients treated with Atezo/Bev and 255 with LEN, the cumulative incidence of proteinuria at 12 months was 27.5%. In the multivariable analysis, Atezo/Bev treatment (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.03-2.42), diabetes (aHR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.03-2.61), hypertension (aHR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.04-4.97), Child-Pugh class B (aHR: 3.43; 95% CI: 1.34-8.78), macrovascular invasion (MVI; aHR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.04-2.38), and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (aHR: 3.21; 95% CI: 1.84-5.62) were identified as risk factors for proteinuria. A higher risk of proteinuria in Atezo/Bev patients compared with LEN was consistently observed in the PS-matched cohort, particularly pronounced in subgroups with MVI (HR: 2.84; 95% CI: 1.23-6.54) compared with those without MVI (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 0.69-2.47). CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with Atezo/Bev as first-line systemic treatment for HCC exhibited a higher risk of proteinuria compared with those with LEN, particularly when accompanied by MVI.",

A Creosote plume from the Englewood Rail Yards wood treatment processes during the early 1900s to the 1980s is one suspected cause identified by community groups. We present a case study that demonstrates how complex spatial analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to identify spatial relationships between soil contaminant risk variables (total incremental lifetime cancer risk (LCR), the total concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), benzo(a)pyrene, naphthalene, and pyrene) and the CDC's Environmental Justice Index (EJI). The results identify spatial patterns between the distribution of PAH contaminants and areas with the highest cumulative environmental injustice impacts. The bivariate LISA High-High (HH) clusters delineate areas near the creosote plant where high PAH concentrations and increased cancer risk converge with heightened environmental burdens. Low-Low (LL) clusters, signifying areas with lesser PAH exposure and environmental strains, predominantly spanned the southeastern sectors of the study site. Furthermore, the spatial outliers yielded from bivariate LISA highlight spatial discrepancies: areas with low soil contaminant hazards surrounded by high EJI values were evident in the southwest, while regions of amplified soil contaminant risk juxtaposed against reduced EJI scores were primarily spotted in the southeastern quadrant. By discerning the nuanced distribution and potential exposure points of soil contaminants, spatial analytics enable public health professionals to craft targeted interventions, ensuring that mitigation efforts are targeted where they are most needed.",

    "AbstractText": "RNA can interact with positively charged, amphiphilic peptides to cooperatively assemble into fibrils that enable RNA transport across cancer cellular membranes. RNA decreases the folding energy barrier imposed by the electrostatic repulsion between these charged peptides, thus partaking in RNA-peptide self-assembly along particular pathways in the energy landscape. Specific amphiphilic peptides capable of protecting and transporting RNA across a membrane have Type II' β-turn hairpin forming motifs in their structures, which aids self-assembly into β-sheet fibrils. We employed a set of such cationic, amphiphilic peptides that have random coiled structures in the absence of folding stimuli, to characterize the (peptides):(RNA) assembly. We subjected these complexes to extensive biophysical characterization in vitro and in cell culture. We show that short RNAs (such as Dicer substrate RNAs) can lead these peptides to self-assemble into β-sheet fibrils that have RNA transport capabilities and can act as non-viral delivery vectors for RNA. Modulation in the peptide sequence implicitly alters the way they bind RNA and influence the peptides' ability to transport nucleic acids across membranes.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Both medical care and observational studies in oncology require a thorough understanding of a patient's disease progression and treatment history, often elaborately documented within clinical notes. As large language models (LLMs) are being considered for use within medical workflows, it becomes important to evaluate their potential in oncology. However, no current information representation schema fully encapsulates the diversity of oncology information within clinical notes, and no comprehensively annotated oncology notes exist publicly, thereby limiting a thorough evaluation. METHODS: We curated a new fine-grained, expert-labeled dataset of 40 deidentified breast and pancreatic cancer progress notes at the University of California, San Francisco, and assessed the abilities of three recent LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and FLAN-UL2) in zero-shot extraction of detailed oncological information from two narrative sections of clinical progress notes. Model performance was quantified with BLEU-4, ROUGE-1, and exact-match (EM) F1 score metrics. RESULTS: Our team annotated 9028 entities, 9986 modifiers, and 5312 relationships. The GPT-4 model exhibited overall best performance, with an average BLEU score of 0.73, an average ROUGE score of 0.72, an average EM F1 score of 0.51, and an average accuracy of 68% (expert manual evaluation on subset). Notably, GPT-4 was proficient in tumor characteristic and medication extraction and demonstrated superior performance in advanced reasoning tasks of inferring symptoms due to cancer and considerations of future medications. Common errors included partial responses with missing information and hallucinations with note-specific information. CONCLUSIONS: By developing a comprehensive schema and benchmark of oncology-specific information in oncology notes, we uncovered both the strengths and the limitations of LLMs. Our evaluation showed variable zero-shot extraction capability among the GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and FLAN-UL2 models and highlighted a need for further improvements, particularly in complex medical reasoning, before performing reliable information extraction for clinical research and complex population management and documenting quality patient care.

However, associated factors related to not RTW among patients with BC remain unclear. In this study, we examined associated factors of not RTW among patients with BC. METHODS: A cross-sectional study and convenience sampling were conducted in two hospitals in Indonesia to recruit eligible participants. Factors related to not RTW were collected and included symptoms of distress, loneliness, anxiety/depression, perceived social support, and frailty. A logistic regression model was performed to explore associated factors of not RTW. FINDINGS: In total, 250 patients with BC were included in this study, and 148 of them experienced not RTW. Anxiety, loneliness, frailty, and social support emerged as significant factors associated with not RTW. BC patients who had a higher anxiety level (odds ratio [OR]: 5.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.16, 12.98]), had high loneliness (OR: 3.15, 95% CI [1.29, 7.67]), or were frail (OR: 2.53; 95% CI [1.07, 5.98]) had a higher risk of not RTW.

This protocol describes an assay to monitor APOBEC deaminase activity in vitro on a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide. The method described here focuses specifically on APOBEC3B to illustrate the different steps of the assay. However, the protocol can be applied to monitor the DNA deaminase activity of any other member of the APOBEC family, such as APOBEC3A. This assay involves preparing APOBEC3B-expressing cell extract or purifying APOBEC3B by immunoprecipitation, followed by incubation with a single-stranded DNA containing a TpC motif. The deaminated cytosine is then removed by recombinant Uracil DNA Glycosylase present in the reaction to form an abasic site. The abasic site creates a weakness in the DNA's backbone, causing the DNA to be cleaved under high temperatures and alkaline conditions. Denaturing gel electrophoresis is used to separate cleaved DNA from full-length DNA, enabling the quantification of the percentage of deamination induced by APOBEC3B. This protocol can be used to determine the presence of APOBEC and the regulation of APOBEC activity in specific cell lines, to study substrate preference targeted by different members of the APOBEC family and different APOBEC mutants, or to determine the efficiency and specificity of inhibitor compounds against APOBEC enzymes.",

We use tissue engineering approaches to recreate the three-dimensional tumor microenvironment in vitro, then analyze shifts in metabolism, hyaluronan secretion, HA molecular weight distribution, as well as hyaluronan synthetic enzymes (HAS) and hyaluronidases (HYAL) activity in an array of patient derived xenograft GBM cells. We reveal that endogenous HA plays a role in mitochondrial respiration and cell proliferation in a tumor subtype dependent manner. We propose a tumor specific combination treatment of HYAL and HAS inhibitors to disrupt the HA stabilizing role in GBM cells. Taken together, these data shed light on the dual metabolic and ligand - dependent signaling roles of hyaluronan in glioblastoma.",

In East Africa, evidence on the prevalence and factors contributing to the delayed presentation of breast cancer is limited. As a result, this study aims to assess the pooled prevalence of delayed breast cancer presentation and identify contributing factors in East Africa. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of observational studies from East Africa using PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library, Hinari, and Mednar databases. The Newcastle Ottawa 2016 Critical Appraisal Checklist assessed methodological quality. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's test, and heterogeneity was examined with the I-squared test. Data were extracted with Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Stata 11. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of delayed presentation among breast cancer patients in East Africa was 61.85% (95% confidence interval, 48.83%-74.88%). Significant factors contributing to delayed presentation included visiting traditional healers (adjusted odds ratio, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.43-5.59), low educational levels (adjusted odds ratio, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.39-4.82), age > 40 years (adjusted odds ratio, 1.87; 1.03, 2.71), absence of breast pain (adjusted odds ratio, 2.42; 1.09, 3.74), distance >5 km away from home to health institution (adjusted odds ratio, 2.89; 1.54, 4.24), and rural residence (adjusted odds ratio, 3.33; 95% CI, 2.16-4.49).

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The reliability of data-driven predictions in real-world scenarios remains uncertain. This study aimed to develop and validate a machine-learning-based model for predicting clinical outcomes using real-world data from an electronic clinical pathway (ePath) system. METHODS: All available data were collected from patients with lung cancer who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery at two independent hospitals utilizing the ePath system. The primary clinical outcome of interest was prolonged air leak (PAL), defined as drainage removal more than 2 days post-surgery. Data-driven prediction models were developed in a cohort of 314 patients from a university hospital applying sparse linear regression models (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge, and elastic net) and decision tree ensemble models (random forest and extreme gradient boosting). Model performance was then validated in a cohort of 154 patients from a tertiary hospital using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and calibration plots. RESULTS: To mitigate bias, variables with missing data related to PAL or those with high rates of missing data were excluded from the dataset. Fivefold cross-validation indicated improved AUROCs when utilizing key variables, even post-imputation of missing data. Dichotomizing continuous variables enhanced performance, particularly when fewer variables were employed in the decision tree ensemble models. Consequently, regression models incorporating seven key variables in complete case analysis demonstrated superior discriminatory ability for both internal (AUROCs: 0.77-0.84) and external cohorts (AUROCs: 0.75-0.84). These models exhibited satisfactory calibration in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The data-driven prediction model implementing the ePath system exhibited adequate performance in predicting PAL post-video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, optimizing variables and considering population characteristics in a real-world setting.",

    "AbstractText": "&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; The laparoscopic method is a treatment method with proven effectiveness. In 2008, we started treating patients with this method. We present treatment results in unselected patients. This is a retrospective observation.&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; The present article demonstrates the results of a 5-year postoperative follow-up in a group of patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery. We also assessed the importance of basic risk factors such as tumor stage, age, gender, type of complication, and conversion requirement for the survival of patients.&lt;b&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/b&gt; In total, 212 patients with colon or rectal cancer were subjected to a standard laparoscopic procedure. In the case of rectal and sigmoid tumors, a mini-laparotomy was performed in the left iliac fossa. In the case of right hemicolectomy, an anastomosis was created above the abdominal walls. The results were statistically processed. As many as 80% (171) of patients were followed up.&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Overall survival was 66.08%, while cancer-related survival - 61.4%. The cancer recurrence rate was 21.47%. In a multivariate analysis: assuming the same age of diagnosis, an increase in tumor stage by one category according to Dukes causes a 102.532-fold increase in the risk of death within the first 5 years after surgery.&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The results of laparoscopic colorectal cancer treatment in our material are similar to those reported in the literature. The most important prognostic factor for the long-term survival of patients in our material was the stage of cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "The Yellow River Delta (YRD) is rich in oil, natural gas, and land resources. With the expansion of an important oil production base in North China, the increased discharge of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylated/nitrated/oxygenated PAHs (APAHs/NPAHs/OPAHs) into the Yellow River poses a potential risk to the aquatic ecosystem and human health. A total of 42 samples were gathered from trunk streams and tributaries within the YRD region during the wet and dry seasons, and 19 PAHs, 5 APAHs, 16 NPAHs, and 7 OPAHs were measured. The concentrations of ƩPAHs, ƩAPAHs, ƩNPAHs and ƩOPAHs ranged between 29 and 620 ng/L, 6.9-81 ng/L, 0.64-9.0 ng/L, and 7.2-81 ng/L in water, respectively, and 27-420 ng/g, 5.1-130 ng/g, 0.19-1.8 ng/g and 3.9-51 ng/g in sediment, respectively. The oil extraction activities resulted in an increased presence of middle-high molecular weight PAHs and APAHs in sediment, and port activities had a notable influence on the proportion of 1-methylpyrene in both water and sediment. The fugacity fraction analysis suggested that sediment was a secondary source of OPAHs, while benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[e]pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, and 5-methylchrysene migrated from water to sediment. The main contributors to PAHs, APAHs, NPAHs, and OPAHs in water and sediment were combustion and petroleum sources. Compared to water, sediment displayed a heightened ecological risk associated with PAHs, APAHs, NPAHs, and OPAHs. Adults residing in the YRD region were at higher risk of cancer than children, which deserves special attention.",

Immune-related adverse events occur commonly and there are clear guidelines regarding management. Neurological toxicities such as myasthenia gravis (MG) with or without myositis are rare but are associated with high morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This single-centre study presents a series of patients treated with ICIs who subsequently developed immune-related MG. Presenting symptoms, treatments and outcomes were abstracted from retrospective chart review. RESULTS: We identified 16 patients (9 thoracic malignancies, 7 other tumor sites) who were diagnosed with MG after one or more cycles of ICI. Eleven had overlapping myositis. The median time from the first ICI treatment to the onset of symptoms was 49 days (range 17-361). All patients received steroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg); six required other immunosuppressive agents, and five underwent plasma exchange. Only two patients had complete resolution, eight improved with residual symptoms, two experienced initial improvement followed by deterioration, and four worsened despite treatment. Six patients died as a result of myasthenia-related complications (38%), three from progressive cancer (19%) and seven remain alive at the time of review (44%). CONCLUSION: ICI-related MG is a rare and potentially fatal adverse event. Diagnosis and management remain a challenge, especially with negative serological markers and in the presence of overlapping syndromes with high mortality rates. Prompt recognition and multimodality treatment are key. Clinicians should have a low threshold for diagnosis and early management.",

PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-seven UM patients aged 13 to 45 treated with proton beam radiation therapy and 401 age- and sex-matched controls at a tertiary academic center. METHODS: We obtained demographic and genetic data, environmental exposures, and social, medical, and ocular history via retrospective chart review and phone follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures included the prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) of the investigated risk factors in UM patients compared with controls. RESULTS: The median age of UM diagnosis was 38 years (range: 13-45 years); the median follow-up was 102 months (range: 3-329 months). Identified novel risk factors for UM included family history of cutaneous melanoma (OR = 3.06, P = 0.002), Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (2.98, P = 0.02), prior eye trauma (2.94, P = 0.01), secondhand cigarette smoke exposure (2.39, P < 0.001), and previous head and neck surgery (1.81, P = 0.007). Some known risk factors identified include choroidal nevi (11.39, P < 0.001), light eye color (4.69, P < 0.001), White race (4.63, P < 0.001), outdoor sunlight exposure (4.20, P < 0.001), recent pregnancy (4.0, P = 0.002), occupational (2.39, P = 0.003) and toxic chemical (2.27, P = 0.03) exposures, family history of any cancer (2.16, P < 0.001), lack of ultraviolet-blocking eyewear use (2.13, P = 0.01), indoor tanning (2.10, P = 0.03), and propensity to sunburn (1.89, P < 0.05). The prevalence of oculodermal melanocytosis (P = 0.03) and family history of UM (P < 0.001) were significantly greater in UM patients than in controls. Uveal melanoma T-categories were as follows: 39% T1, 37% T2, 19% T3, and 5% T4. Gene expression profiling was available in 64 patients and showed 59% class 1A, 19% class 1B, and 22% class 2 tumors. Thirteen patients underwent genetic screening; identified germline mutations included CDH1, NF1, and PALB2. The estimated 10-year metastasis-free progression rate and overall survival were 80% and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several novel risk factors for UM in AYAs and confirmed select established risk factors seen in UM patients of all ages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit and comprehensive investigation of risk factors among a younger cohort and may help further elucidate UM pathogenesis.

    "ArticleTitle": "Identification of a cancer stem cell-like subpopulation that promotes HCC metastasis.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are well-established drivers of tumorigenesis, but their role in regulating tumor metastasis remains poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a cluster of metastasis-promoting CSC-like cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: CSC-like cells in HCC were identified through the analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data from 19 HCC samples. The stemness and invasive characteristics of these cells were evaluated using bioinformatical analyses of nine clinical cohorts and experimental validations. Spatial transcriptomics sequencing of 12 HCC samples revealed the cellular interactions between the CSC-like cells and tumor microenvironments, which were validated through gene co-expression analyses and immunohistochemistry. Finally, signaling pathway blockade was used to assess the potential clinical application of CSC-like cells. RESULTS: Through comprehensive analyses of single cell RNA-sequencing data from 19 patients with HCC and spatial transcriptomics data from 12 patients with HCC, a metastasis-promoting CSC-like subpopulation was identified. These CSC-like cells expressed high levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes and were associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Histologically, CSC-like cells were enriched in highly aggressive tumors, especially in intrahepatic disseminated foci, where they interacted with immune cells. Functionally, CSC-like cells induced macrophage M2 polarization and T cell exhaustion through the ICAM1 signaling pathway, forming immunosuppressive microenvironments. Downregulation of ICAM1 expression in CSC-like cells suppressed macrophage M2-polarization and T cell exhaustion, thereby reversing antitumor immune effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a metastasis-promoting CSC subpopulation, providing a potential perspective for CSC-targeted therapies in HCC. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: The heterogeneity of CSCs in HCC has been identified, yet the identification and characterization of metastasis-promoting CSC subpopulations remain unexplored. Here, we identified a CSC-like tumor cell subpopulation that promotes HCC metastasis by increasing cell invasiveness and suppressing antitumor immune responses via the ICAM1 signaling pathway. Our study uncovers novel mechanisms of HCC metastasis from the perspective of CSCs, and proposes potential tumor therapeutic strategies by inhibiting cellular interactions between CSC-like cells and immune cells.",

Additionally, recent advancements in the pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction for treating IBD and CRC, encompassing mitochondrial damage, release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and impairment of mitophagy, are thoroughly summarized. The review also provides a systematic overview of natural compounds (such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and diterpenoids), Chinese medicines, and intestinal microbiota, which can alleviate IBD and attenuate the progression of CRC by modulating mitochondrial function.

The incidence of osteosarcoma in children and adolescents is growing annually, although improvements in survival remain limited. With the clinical application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy combined with limb-preserving surgery has gained momentum as a major intervention. However, certain patients with OS experience treatment failure owing to chemoradiotherapy resistance or metastasis. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key antioxidant factor in organisms, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular physiological homeostasis; however, its overactivation in cancer cells restricts reactive oxygen species production, promotes DNA repair and drug efflux, and ultimately leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance. Recent studies have also identified the functions of Nrf2 beyond its antioxidative function, including the promotion of proliferation, metastasis, and regulation of metabolism. The current review describes the multiple mechanisms of chemoradiotherapy resistance in OS and the substantial role of Nrf2 in the signaling regulatory network to elucidate the function of Nrf2 in promoting OS chemoradiotherapy resistance and formulating relevant therapeutic strategies.",

These T-cell products are typically engineered by vectors that permanently integrate into the T-cell genome, thus raising concerns about potential risks of insertional mutagenesis. Therefore, it becomes imperative to assess the integrated vector copy number (VCN) as a critical safety parameter for gene-engineered cell products. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we developed a robust assay for assessing the VCN of chimeric antigen receptor-T cell and T-cell receptor T-cell products, based on the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method. To provide accurate representation of the VCN in gene-engineered cells, we implemented a calculation that factors in the putative transduction efficiency based on Poisson distribution statistics. The adjusted VCN value (VCNadj) was also compared with VCN value from sorted transgene-positive cell populations, to validate its accuracy. RESULTS: This assay consistently and accurately determines the average VCN for cell products. By comparing the VCN in sorted transgene-positive cell populations, we validated the refinement calculation provides a closer approximation to the actual VCN within transduced cells, offering a more realistic representation of the VCN for engineered cell products.

Studies exploring this approach in patients ineligible for clinical trials are lacking. We assembled a cohort of patients receiving pemetrexed-based chemotherapy with durvalumab outside of clinical trials. METHODS: Patients with pleural mesothelioma received pemetrexed plus durvalumab or carboplatin plus pemetrexed plus durvalumab via off-label authorization at Massachusetts General Hospital. Response to chemoimmunotherapy was assessed per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. A retrospective chart review was conducted to assess safety per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in the series. Nine patients were treated with triplet chemoimmunotherapy. Three patients received doublet chemoimmunotherapy because of platinum ineligibility. Concurrent active malignancies and symptomatic cardiac disease were present in three patients (25%) and two patients (17%), respectively. Ten patients had measurable disease at baseline. With the triplet regimen, partial responses were observed in four of the seven (57%) patients with measurable disease. All three patients receiving pemetrexed plus durvalumab had measurable disease and experienced a partial response. Primary progression was not observed with either regimen. Overall, eight patients (75%) remained on treatment for more than 6 months without progression. Five patients developed immune-related adverse events (n = 1 each pyrexia, arthritis, neutropenia, Raynaud's disease, stomatitis). Three patients discontinued treatment because of toxicity or symptomatic comorbid conditions (n = 1 grade 3 heart failure, n = 1 grade 2 fever + progressive kidney cancer, n = 1 grade 2 fatigue).

Specific clinical situations, including post-lobectomy, lung transplantation, and metastatic cancer, can precipitate PVT. Accurate and prompt diagnosis, requiring a high index of suspicion and advanced imaging techniques like computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiography, is crucial to prevent severe complications such as peripheral embolization and acute stroke. Risk factors include surgical procedures, cancers, and potentially atrial fibrillation, with a high post-surgical thrombosis risk, especially after left upper lobectomy.

In this study, we found that the linc-SPRY3 RNAs are one large lncRNA that we named Radiation Induced Y-chromosome linked long non-coding RNA (lnc-RAINY). Through ATAC-seq and immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that lnc-RAINY interacts with DNA in a triple helix to induce chromatin remodeling and gene expression. We also identified that lnc-RAINY regulates CDC6 and CDC25A expression affecting senescence induction, cell migration patterns, and cell cycle regulation.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), successful translation of experimental targets identified in mouse models to human patients has proven challenging. In this study, we used a comprehensive transcriptomic approach in mice to identify novel potential targets for therapeutic intervention in humans. METHODS: We analyzed combined genome-wide miRNA and mRNA expression data in three pathogenically distinct mouse models of liver cancer. Effects of target genes on hepatoma cell fitness were evaluated by proliferation, survival and motility assays. TCGA and GEO databases, in combination with tissue microarrays, were used to validate the mouse targets and their impact on human HCC prognosis. Finally, the functional effects of the identified targets on tumorigenesis and tumor therapy were tested in hydrodynamic tail vein injection-based preclinical HCC models in vivo. RESULTS: The expression of miR-107 was found to be significantly reduced in mouse models of liver tumors of various etiologies and in cohorts of humans with HCC. Overexpression of miR-107 or inhibition of its novel target kinesin family member 23 (Kif23) significantly reduced proliferation by interfering with cytokinesis, thereby controlling survival and motility of mouse and human hepatoma cells. In humans, KIF23 expression was found to be a prognostic marker in liver cancer, with high expression associated with poor prognosis. Hydrodynamic tail vein injection of vectors carrying either pre-miR-107 or anti-Kif23 shRNA inhibited the development of highly aggressive c-Myc-NRAS-induced liver cancers in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of the miR-107/Kif23 axis inhibited hepatoma cell proliferation in vitro and prevented oncogene-induced liver cancer development in vivo, offering a novel potential avenue for the treatment of HCC in humans. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study revealed the central role of the miR-107/KIF23 axis in controlling tumor cell fitness and hepatocellular carcinoma progression. The results demonstrate that the overexpression of miR-107 or silencing of its target, KIF23, markedly suppresses the proliferation, survival, and motility of human and mouse hepatoma cells. In this work, we demonstrate that the disruption of miR-107/Kif23 signaling effectively protects mice from an aggressive form of oncogene-induced liver cancer in vivo, implying that targeting miR-107/KIF23 might be a novel therapeutic approach for hepatocellular carcinoma in humans.",

Kidney diseases are associated with complex and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Spatial metabolomics through mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables spatial mapping of the lipids in tissue and includes a variety of techniques that can be used to image lipids. In the kidney, MSI studies often seek to resolve individual functional tissue units such as glomeruli and proximal tubules. Several different MSI techniques, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), have been used to characterize lipids and small molecules in chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, genetic kidney disease, and cancer. In this review we provide several examples of how spatial metabolomics data can provide critical information concerning the localization of changes in various disease states. Additionally, when combined with pathology, transcriptomics, or proteomics, the metabolomic changes can illuminate underlying mechanisms and provide new clinical insights into disease mechanisms.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Comparative Study of Serum Malondialdehyde in Women with Cervical Cancer and Women with High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Infection at The Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Lagos.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality among women in developing countries. HPV infection has been detected in more than 99% of cervical cancers throughout the world. Among the effective factors in the progression of HPV infection is oxidative stress which can influence the host immune responses to viral proteins and viral genes expression. AIM: To determine the association between serum malondialdehyde concentration in women with cervical cancer and women with high-risk human papillomavirus infection at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Lagos (LASUTH). METHODS: This was a comparative cross-sectional study where 90 women from the gynaecology and colposcopy as well as medical oncology clinics of LASUTH were recruited using convenience sampling method. This study comprised 30 women with histologically confirmed cervical cancer, 30 women with high-risk human papilloma virus infection and 30 apparently healthy women negative for high-risk human papilloma virus infection. Fasting blood samples of consenting women were obtained and serum malondialdehyde were measured using spectrophotometric method. Data was given as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and significant differences between means were assessed by Student's t-test. Analysis of data was carried out by using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 23 software. P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Results indicated that the mean serum malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher among women with cervical cancer (6.13 ± 4.1 nmol/l) and those with high-risk HPV infection (5.61±3.0nmol/l) compared to women negative for high-risk HPV infection (0.35±0.2nmol/l). A statistically significant association was observed between cervical cancer and negative high-risk HPV infection(p<0.001). However, no significant association was found between cervical cancer and positive high-risk HPV infection (p = 0.57). CONCLUSION: The study's conclusion highlighted significantly elevated serum malondialdehyde levels in women with cervical cancer and high-risk HPV infection compared to those without high- risk HPV infection, indicating increased oxidative stress. It also noted no significant disparity in serum malondialdehyde levels between women with cervical cancer and those with high-risk HPV infection. The findings underscored the importance of conducting serum antioxidant studies in these women to mitigate oxidative stress.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of \"Zhibian\" (BL54)-to-\"Shuidao\" (ST28) needling technique on the reproductive function of the mice with poor ovarian response (POR) and explore the molecular mechanism of acupuncture on early embryos after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in POR mice. METHODS: Of 70 female C57BL/6 mice, 60 mice with regular estrous cycle were screened and 30 of them were randomly divided into a blank group, a model group, and an acupuncture group, 10 mice in each one. Mice in the model and acupuncture groups were administered with tripterygium glycosides suspension (50 mg·kg-1·d-1) via gavage for 2 weeks to prepare POR models; while in the blank group, the mice received an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride solution via gavage. After successful modeling, mice in the acupuncture group underwent \"Zhibian\" (BL54)-to-\"Shuidao\" (ST28) needling technique, once daily, for 20 min each time and lasting 2 consecutive weeks. After intervention completion, subsequently, all the three groups underwent ovulation induction, orbital blood collection, and ovary extraction and fresh denuded oocyte collection. Denuded oocytes, after incubated, together with the sperms from 15 male C57BL/6 mice, were transferred into the oviducts of 30 donor pseudopregnant C57BL/6 female mice via IVF-ET; and the embryonic tissue was collected on day 7 of implantation. After successful modeling and intervention completion, the general conditions of mice in each group were observed, and the estrous cycle disorder rate was compared among the groups. After intervention completion, the numbers of oocyte, ovarian wet weight and ovarian index were recorded in each group; the levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E2) in the serum were measured using ELISA; and ovarian morphology and mitochondrial ultrastructure were examined using HE staining and transmission electron microscopy. The transcriptome sequencing technology was employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in early embryos of each group, followed by bioinformatics analysis; and the reversed DEGs with significant difference were verified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: After intervention, compared with the blank group, the mice in the model group presented poor spirits and declined water and food intake, reduced activity, the higher rate of estrous cycle disorder (P< 0.01); the decrease of the numbers of oocyte, ovarian wet weight, and ovarian index (P<0.01), reduced AMH and E2 in the serum (P<0.01), elevated FSH and LH in the serum (P<0.01); more atresia follicles in ovarian tissue, disorganized granulosa cells, reduced the numbers of mitochondria, vacuoles appeared and cristae breakage. When compared with the model group, in the acupuncture group, the spirits of mice, food intake and activity were improved, the rate of estrous cycle disorder was reduced (P<0.01); the numbers of oocyte, ovarian wet weight, and ovarian index were higher (P<0.01, P<0.05), the levels of AMH and E2 in the serum increased (P<0.01), the levels of FSH and LH in the serum decreased (P<0.01); the atresia follicles were reduced, the numbers of follicle increased at all levels, the numbers of mitochondria got higher, vacuoles and cristae breakage were declined. In comparison between the blank group and the model group, and between the model group and the acupuncture group, a total of 258 intersecting DEGs were identified, and 194 DEGs of them exhibited a trend of reversion before and after intervention. The top 5 reversed DEGs with significant difference included dexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1 (Rasd1), gene regulated by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (Greb1), leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (Lgr6), Fraser syndrome 1 (Fras1), and apolipoprotein D (Apod). Compared with the blank group, the mRNA expression of Rasd1, Greb1, Lgr6, Fras1 and Apod in embryonic tissues decreased in the model group (P<0.01, P<0.05); and when compared with the model group, the mRNA expression of Rasd1, Greb1, Lgr6, Fras1 and Apod in embryonic tissues increased in the acupuncture group (P<0.05, P<0.01). These findings were consistent with the DEGs screening results. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the reversed genes of co-expression were primarily participated in the biological processes such as myoblast differentiation, endocardial cushion development, and cardiac morphogenesis. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the reversed genes of co-expression are enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway, and they were associated with various types of cardiac diseases. CONCLUSION: The \"Zhibian\" (BL54)-to-\"Shuidao\" (ST28) needling technique may ameliorate the decline of ovarian response in mice with POR, promote normal follicle development and ovulation, thereby improve embryo quality and reduce the risk of developmental defects and deformity in the organs such as the embryonic heart. The underlying mechanism may be related to the regulation of the expression pattern of embryonic key genes through the Wnt signaling pathway.",

However, when the tissue tolerance level is exceeded, unnecessary and uncontrolled exposure to radiation is considered detrimental. Such problems remain difficult to prevent and manage. The aim of the study to evaluate and compare the degree of attenuation of therapeutic radiation using four different radiation shielding materials of varying thickness. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: In vitro experimental study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples were divided into four groups based on the different radiation shielding materials of thickness 3mm and 5mm. The materials are Lead (Pb), Silver-tin alloy (Ag-Sn) with Polyvinylsiloxane (PVS), Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with Barium sulphate (BaSO4), and a combination of Ag-Sn with PVS and PMMA with BaSO4 which was exposed to radiation. The radiation dose measurements were recorded and the radiation attenuation properties of the shielding materials were evaluated. Among all of the shielding materials the most efficient material under consideration is determined. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc test was used to compare the means of all four groups. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference between groups was found by a one-way ANOVA with a P = 0.001. In the post hoc test, statistically significant findings were obtained with a P = 0.05 when comparing the variation values of 3mm and 5mm thickness between each group and other groups. CONCLUSION: The shielding materials results in significant reductions in radiation dosage. It was concluded that the combinations of Ag-Sn alloy with PVS, and PMMA with BaSO4 of thickness 5 mm had a good shielding effect.",

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was designed as a prospective and clinical study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four CAM patients undergoing maxillectomy and subsequent prosthetic rehabilitation were included. The treatment involved surgical, intermediate, and definitive obturator delivery at various phases of healing. PS was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), QOL using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire-Head and Neck Module (EORTC QLQ-HandN35), and the functioning of obturator was assessed utilising the Obturator Functioning Scale (OFS) at various time points: before maxillectomy (T1), 2 weeks after maxillectomy (T2), 2 weeks upon usage of intermediate obturator (T3), just before delivery of definitive obturator (T4), and 12 weeks after the usage of definitive obturator (T5). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed using a social science statistical analysis program (Stata 14.0; StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA). The significance level was chosen <0.05. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of quantitative data. Student's t-test was employed (α =0.05) to evaluate if the patient's PS, QOL, and obturator function had changed over time. The Spearman correlation coefficient (α =0.05) was utilized to evaluate the correlation coefficient between PS, QOL, and obturator function seen at T3 and T5. RESULTS: Out of 24 enrolled patients, nine were dropped out. HADS-anxiety score was the highest at T1 (18.6 ± 1.2) and HADS-depression score was the highest at T2 (18.8 ± 1.6). HADS scores decreased significantly (P = 0.001) after prosthetic rehabilitation. EORTC QLQ-HandN35 score was the highest at T2 (105.8 ± 29.5), with statistical significance (P = 0.001) after rehabilitation. OFS was the highest at T3 (51.9 ± 3.9) and lowest at T5 (25.4 ± 2.8). CONCLUSION: CAM and maxillectomy deliberately affects the PS and QOL. Prosthetic rehabilitation, psychological motivation, and education create greater improvement in PS and QOL. The progress in parameters showed an upward trend with good obturator quality over a period of time.",

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 500 patients from Southwest China, divided into two groups: depression (n = 220) and no depression (n = 280). Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, and socioeconomic factors were collected. We developed a logistic regression model to predict depressive symptoms and assessed its accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 500 middle-aged and young female cancer patients with a median age of 44 years. Significant predictors of depressive symptoms included younger age, higher economic stress levels, and out-of-pocket medical expenses. A comparative analysis showed that 220 patients exhibited depression symptoms, with these patients being generally younger (median age 41 years) compared to those without depression (median age 47 years, p < 0.001). Economic stress was consistently higher in the depression group across all cancer types. Patients with ovarian cancer had a reduced risk of depression compared to those with cervical cancer. The predictive model demonstrated high accuracy in identifying depression risk, with an AUC of 0.888. Internal validation yielded an average AUC of 0.885, and external validation produced an AUC of 0.872, underscoring the model's robustness and reliability. These findings emphasize the complex interplay of demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors in the psychological well-being of gynecological cancer patients, highlighting the need for tailored psychological and financial support interventions. CONCLUSION: Gynecological cancer patients in Southwest China experience significant psychological challenges, particularly younger women and those facing economic stress. Our predictive model can aid in early identification of those at risk for depression, emphasizing the importance of holistic care. Interventions should focus on both psychological and financial support to improve patient outcomes.",

We tested the capacity of personal resources (psychological resilience, social support, and process of recovery) for predicting depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety (CDA) among such patients using machine learning (ML). We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Liaoning Province, China, including questions about demographics, COVID-19's impact, and personal resources (707 valid responses). In the training set, we used Lasso logistic regression to establish personal resource models. Subsequently, we used six ML methods and a tenfold cross-validation strategy to establish models combining personal resources, demographics, and COVID-19 impacts. Findings indicate that in total, 21.9%, 35.1%, and 14.7% of participants showed depression, anxiety, and CDA, respectively. Loneliness, vitality, mental health, bodily pain, and self-control predicted depression, anxiety, and CDA. Furthermore, general health predicted depression, and physical function predicted anxiety. Demographic and COVID-19 models were far less predictive than personal resource models (0.505-0.629 vs. 0.826-0.869). Among combined models, the support vector machine model achieved the best prediction (AUC: 0.832-0.873), which was slightly better than the personal resource models.

    "AbstractText": "Germline pathogenic genetic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most frequent causes of familial breast and ovarian cancer. Contrasting BRCA2, epimutations in the BRCA1 gene are frequently detected in tissue from triple-negative breast (TNBC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC). While studies over the last decade have reported BRCA1 epimutations in white blood cells (WBC) from breast and ovarian cancer patients, the potential hazard ratio for incident TNBC and HGSOC was not formally assessed until recently. Conducting a prospective nested case-control study on women participating in the American Women's Health Initiative Study, we provided firm evidence that mosaic WBC BRCA1 epimutations, even at allele frequencies < 0.1%, are associated with a significantly increased risk of both incident HGSOC and TNBC > 5 years after WBC collection. In a second study assessing BRCA1 epimutations in WBC and matched tumor samples from TNBC, our results indicated such epimutations to be the underlying cause of around 20% of TNBC, far exceeding the percentage of cases carrying BRCA1 germline pathogenic genetic variants. We detected primary constitutional BRCA1 epimutations in tissues derived from all three germ layers. They occur independently of BRCA1 promoter haplotypes but are present on the same allele in all WBC within affected individuals. Moreover, epimutations are consistently found on the same allele in normal and tumor breast tissue as well as in WBC. This finding, together with BRCA1 epimutations detected in WBC from newborns, strongly indicates an early embryonic event with clonal expansion affecting all germ layers. Future work in the field must lead to an understanding of exactly when and how the BRCA1 epimutations occur and, most importantly, whether primary constitutional epimutations in genes other than BRCA1 may cause an elevated risk of other cancer types.",

This narrative review is aimed at exploring the phenotypic spectrum of MAP to better characterize the MAP phenotype. Literature search was conducted to identify articles reporting on MAP-specific phenotypes. Clinical data from 2109 MAP patients identified from the literature showed that 1123 patients (53.2%) had CRC. Some patients with CRC had no associated adenomas, suggesting that adenomas are not an obligatory component of MAP. Carriers of the two missense founder variants, and possibly truncating variants, had an increased cancer risk when compared to those who carry other pathogenic variants. It has been suggested that somatic G:C > T:A transversions are a mutational signature of MAP and could be used as a biomarker in screening and identifying patients with atypical MAP, or in associating certain phenotypes with MAP. The extracolonic and extraintestinal manifestations that have been associated with MAP include duodenal adenomas, duodenal cancer, fundic gland polyps, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, and skin cancer. The association of breast cancer and endometrial cancer with MAP remains disputed. Desmoid tumors and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPEs) are rarely reported in MAP but have long been seen in FAP patients and thus could act as a distinguishing feature between the two. This collection of MAP phenotypes will assist in the assessment of pathogenic MUTYH variants using the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) Variant Interpretation Guidelines and ultimately improve patient care.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A Review on the Impact of Aberrant Methylation in Breast Cancer: Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Therapeutic Approaches.",
    "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) is still a major global health concern, and a key factor in its pathophysiology is epigenetic abnormalities, specifically DNA methylation and histone modifications. This review offers a thorough examination of current research on the effects of these epigenetic changes in BC, emphasizing significant discoveries in the fields of prognosis, diagnostics, and treatment strategies. In particular, the advancement of breast cancer and patient survival have been connected to promoter methylation of genes including BRCA1, DAPK1, and RASSF1A. Furthermore, there is a correlation between tumor size and grade and the methylation state of APAF1, GSTP1, and ER. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, are essential for controlling gene expression in breast cancer. Changes in these modifications are associated with the advancement of tumors and resistance to therapy. The analysis highlights the potential of methylation-targeting medicines to improve the effectiveness of traditional chemotherapy and reveals particular methylation indicators that differentiate malignant tissues from normal ones. Further clinical validation is necessary to confirm the efficacy of DNMT and HMT inhibitors in mitigating hormone resistance and epigenetic modifications in BC, despite encouraging outcomes. Large-scale trials are necessary to validate these results, and investigating combination therapy, including those targeting histone modifications, to enhance patient outcomes is one of the main recommendations.",

    "ArticleTitle": "HLAPepBinder: An Ensemble Model for The Prediction Of HLA-Peptide Binding.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating the host's immune response, offering a promising avenue with reduced adverse effects compared to conventional treatments. Cancer immunotherapies use HLA class I molecules for T cells to recognize tumor antigens, emphasizing the importance of identifying peptides that bind effectively to HLAs. Computer modeling of HLA-peptide binding speeds up the search for immunogenic epitopes, which enhances the prospect of personalized medicine and targeted therapies. The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is a vital repository, housing curated immune epitope data and prediction tools for HLA-peptide binding. It can be challenging for immunologists to choose the best tool from the IEDB for predicting HLA-peptide binding. This has led to the creation of consensus-based methods that combine the results of several predictors. One of the major challenges in these methods is how to effectively integrate the results from multiple predictors. OBJECTIVES: Previous consensus-based methods integrate at most three tools by relying on simple strategies, such as selecting prediction methods based on their proximity to HLA in training data. In this study, we introduce HLAPepBinder, a novel consensus approach using ensemble machine learning methods to predict HLA-peptide binding, addressing the challenges biologists face in model selection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The key contribution is the development of an automatic pipeline named HLAPepBinder that integrates the predictions of multiple models using a random forest approach. Unlike previous approaches, HLAPepBinder seamlessly integrates results from all nine predictors, providing a comprehensive and accurate predictive framework. By combining the strengths of these models, HLAPepBinder eliminates the need for manual model selection, providing a streamlined and reliable solution for biologists. RESULTS: HLAPepBinder offers a practical and high-performing alternative for HLA-peptide binding predictions, outperforming both traditional methods and complex deep learning models. Compared to the recently introduced transformer-based model, TranspHLA, which requires substantial computational resources, HLAPepBinder demonstrates superior performance in both prediction accuracy and resource efficiency. Notably, it operates effectively in limited computational environments, making it accessible to researchers with minimal resources. The codes are available online at https://github.com/CBRC-lab/HLAPepBinder. CONCLUSION: Our study introduces a novel ensemble-learning model designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of HLA-peptide binding predictions. Due to the lack of reliable negative data and the typical assumption of unknown interactions being negative, we focus on analyzing the unknown HLA-peptide bindings in the test set that our model predicts with 100% certainty as positive bindings. Using HLAPepBinder, we identify 26 HLA-peptide pairs with absolute prediction confidence. These predictions are validated through a multi-step pipeline involving literature review, BLAST sequence similarity analysis, and molecular docking studies. This comprehensive validation process highlights HLAPepBinder's ability to make accurate and reliable predictions, contributing significantly to advancements in immunotherapy and vaccine development.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer, with poor prognosis despite treatments like temozolomide (TMZ). Resistance to TMZ is a significant clinical challenge, and understanding the genes involved is crucial for developing new therapies and prognostic markers. This study aims to identify key genes associated with TMZ resistance in GBM, which could serve as valuable biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes and potential targets for treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify genes involved in TMZ resistance in GBM and to assess the value of these genes in GBM treatment and prognosis evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE113510 and GSE199689) and The Chinese Glioblastoma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GBM cell lines with and without TMZ resistance. Subsequently, the key modules associated with GBM patient prognosis were identified by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Furthermore, hub genes related to TMZ resistance were accurately screened and confirmed using three machine learning algorithms. In addition, immune cell infiltration analysis, TF-miRNA coregulatory network analysis, drug sensitivity prediction, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were also performed for temozolomide resistance-specific genes. Finally, the expression levels of key genes were validated in our constructed TMZ-resistant cell lines by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting (WB). RESULTS: Integrated analysis of the GEO and CGGA datasets revealed 769 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), comprising 350 downregulated and 419 upregulated genes, between GBM patients and normal controls. Among these DEGs, three key genes, namely, PITX1, TNFRSF11B, and IGFBP2, exhibited significant differences in expression between groups and were prioritized via machine learning algorithms. The expression levels of these genes were found to be closely related to adverse clinical features and immune cell infiltration levels in GBM patients. These genes were also found to participate in several biological pathways and processes. RT‒qPCR and WB confirmed the differential expression of these genes in vitro, indicating that they play vital roles in GBM patients with TMZ resistance. CONCLUSIONS: PITX1, TNFRSF11B, and IGFBP2 are key genes associated with the prognosis of GBM patients with TMZ resistance. The differential expression of these genes correlates with adverse outcomes in GBM patients, suggesting that they are valuable biomarkers for predicting patient prognosis and that they could serve as diagnostic biomarkers or treatment targets.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Bioinformatic Approaches for the Identification of Novel Tumor Suppressor Genes and Cancer Pathways in Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC, KIRC) is the most prevalent subtype of RCC, and even with different available therapies, the average progression-free survival is worse. Therefore, the identification of new molecular targets could be helpful for its therapeutic purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Cancer Genome Atlas to perform bioinformatic analyses for genes with possible tumor suppressor roles in KIRC. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to identify new prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for this type of cancer. RESULTS: We identified 14 down-regulated genes in KIRC that had not previously been studied or poorly studied, with the majority of them impacted by increased promoter methylation. Eight genes showed shorter overall survival and worse prognosis, indicating their function as tumor suppressors, and six genes revealed good prognosis. From the 8 genes, C7ORF41 and CTXN3 revealed only downregulation in most cancers, proposing them as highly potential tumor suppressors. Among these 8 genes, the function of CTXN3 in cancers is unknown. Moreover, we identified the CWH43 gene as the major signature of KIRC. In addition, we found different genes as signatures of KIRC tumor stages and grades. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may shed light on identifying KIRC pathogenesis and developing effective therapeutic targets for renal cancers, mainly KIRC.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Examining Work Engagement in Integrated Nursing-Care Service Wards: Insights from Structural Equation Modeling.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: In 2016, the South Korean Integrated Nursing-Care Service, covered by national insurance, was initiated, with a particular focus on cancer-oriented units. Integrated Nursing-Care Service Wards denote facilities wherein nursing professionals deliver holistic care, in the absence of paid informal caregivers (hereafter will be called caregiver). AIM: This study, framed within Demerouti's Job Demands-Job Resources Model, aimed to analyze variables influencing nurses' work engagement in Integrated Nursing-Care Service wards. METHODS: From April to June 2022, 375 participants working at three certified tertiary hospitals operating Integrated Nursing-Care Service wards completed the survey. Of the 400 distributed questionnaires, 375 were used for analysis, resulting in a response rate of 93.75%. The remaining 25 questionnaires were excluded due to insufficient responses. Job demands, job resources, and personal resources were assigned as exogenous variables that predicted burnout and work engagement of nurses, while burnout and work engagement were assigned as endogenous variables. In this model, 32 hypotheses were established, and to verify the hypotheses, the direct effect of each exogenous variable on work engagement and the indirect effect through burnout as a medium were analyzed. RESULTS: Burnout partially mediated the impact of exogenous variables on work engagement. The subfactors revealed partial mediation between emotional labor and work engagement, full mediation for satisfaction with the recognition from patients and caregivers, and partial mediation for resilience. CONCLUSION: Emotional labor had the highest impact on nurses' burnout in Integrated Nursing-Care Service wards, followed by resilience and satisfaction with the recognition from patients and caregivers. Nurses' burnout, work environment, emotional labor, work overload, and resilience significantly influenced their work engagement. Implications for Nursing Management. The results of this study are useful as basic data for research on intervention programs that reduce burnout and increase nurses' work engagement in Integrated Nursing-Care Service wards.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Exploring Psychosocial Needs of Patients with Cancers through the Lens of the Physicians and Nurses: A Qualitative Study.",
    "AbstractText": "AIMS: To explore the experience of nurses and physicians regarding psychosocial needs of patients with cancer and to describe their perception according to professional category and clinical setting. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study. METHOD: 14 nurses and 12 physicians were selected from three hospital clinical units and four primary care centers in northern Spain. Data were collected using semistructured interviews. Content analysis was performed using open coding. Reporting of findings followed the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: the needs of patients with cancer, psychosocial care provided by health professionals, difficulties addressing psychosocial needs, and available resources. According to nurses and physicians, being diagnosed with cancer involves a radical life-changing process, with a profound impact at the psychosocial level. Within the field of psychosocial care, the role perceived by each profession was different. Thus, nurses highlighted the need for these patients to receive emotional support and care, although limited importance is given to psychosocial needs. The role of physicians was more focused on referring these patients to other health professionals. The lack of training or time was one of the main difficulties perceived by the professionals. The family is a fundamental resource and, overall, patients are provided with limited information about other psychosocial resources. At the hospital, the emphasis is placed on physical needs and health professionals experience greater burnout and fear of compassion fatigue. Primary care teams could, therefore, have a primary role in addressing psychosocial needs due to their understanding of each person's context and personal circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential for nurses and physicians to consider the psychosocial needs of patients with cancer. However, these needs are not always adequately addressed. Further resources are required to reduce the workload, increase the training of health professionals, and introduce organizational changes to consider psychosocial needs during routine care.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: According to projections based on current trends, it can be anticipated that from 2024 onward, approximately 70% of all cancer cases will be diagnosed in individuals 65 years and older. Given this complex intersection between population ageing and cancer incidence, it is of great importance to address this issue from a comprehensive care perspective. Here comes the importance of advanced practice nurse into play. However, this figure is still not sufficiently valued in many countries. Its roles are also not clearly defined at the international level. For this reason, a systematic review of the scientific literature was carried out to analyze the impact of advanced practice nurse on the quality of life of older adults with cancer. METHODS: Searches were carried out in PubMed, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, and ScienceDirect databases. They were limited to studies conducted in the last 7 years. Only open-access articles were selected. To analyze the chosen articles and assess their quality, the criteria of the PRISMA and CASPe statements were applied. All authors participated in both the selection of the articles and their analysis. RESULTS: Of the initial 58 articles selected, a total of 10 articles were finally included, as they met the eligibility criteria established after further analysis. The results show a positive relationship between the advanced practice nurse intervention and quality of life in older adults with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced practice nurse (APN) plays a key role in the care of older adults with cancer, significantly improving their quality of life and contributing to the comprehensive care of these patients. The findings evidenced in this work support the integration of APNs in cancer care teams to improve patient experience and overall well-being.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Haematological malignancies (HM) comprise of nearly 10% of all cancers. In oncology, the Health- related quality of life (HRQOL) measure assesses the physical, social and mental health aspects of patients undergoing treatment. There is lack of Indian data on HRQOL in patients with haematological malignancies. The main objective of our study was to assess the parameters of quality of life in adult patients undergoing therapy for haematological malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between 1st March 2023 and 31st July, 2023. Patients included for the study were newly diagnosed patients aged ≥ 18 years with haematological malignancy- (lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma) and undergoing therapy. Patients with relapsed/refractory disease, palliative care and those on follow up or observation were excluded. The primary objective of our study was to explore the parameters of quality of life in adult patients undergoing therapy for haematological malignancies. The secondary objective was to identify factors which are most influential in affecting the quality of life (QoL) in these subset of patients. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QoL questionnaire (QLQ C 30 version 3.0) was used for QoL analysis. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were eligible for evaluation. The median age of patients was 55 years (Range- 18-78 years). The proportion of males was 1.6:1. The total mean global health status score including health and QoL was 73.5 ± 24.4. On comparison with EORTC reference score for all cancer patients, the global health status functional scale in our study was higher. The highest symptom score was observed for fatigue (40.1 ± 26.1) and lowest for diarrhoea being 5.7 ± 14.7. A similar trend in the symptom scales was seen in the EORTC cohort When age groups were compared, means for global health and physical functioning score had statistically significant difference. Amongst symptom scales, fatigue scores were higher as the ages progressed. CONCLUSION: Assessment of QoL in patients with haematological malignancies should be integrated into clinical practice, to understand treatment related morbidity and thereby helping in choosing optimal treatment strategy.

    "AbstractText": "The therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs heavily relies on their concentration and retention at the corresponding target site. Hence, merely increasing the cellular concentration of drugs is insufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic outcomes, especially for the drugs that target specific intracellular sites. This necessitates the implementation of more precise targeting strategies to overcome the limitations posed by diffusion distribution and nonspecific interactions within cells. Consequently, subcellular organelle-targeted cancer therapy, characterized by its exceptional precision, have emerged as a promising approach to eradicate cancer cells through the specific disruption of subcellular organelles. Owing to several advantages including minimized dosage and side effect, optimized efficacy, and reversal of multidrug resistance, subcellular organelle-targeted therapies have garnered significant research interest in recent years. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the distribution of drug targets, targeted delivery strategies at various levels, and sophisticated strategies for targeting specific subcellular organelles. Additionally, we highlight the significance of subcellular targeting in cancer therapy and present essential considerations for its clinical translation.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all patients with lung neoplasm who were referred to medical centers affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and were candidate for lung surgery in 2020-2021. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 52 people were assigned to the study consecutively. Then, the patients completed the demographic information questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) (EORTC QLQ-C30). RESULTS: The score of depression and anxiety was normal (range 7-0) and the score of quality of life was in the relatively good range (50-175). As the patient's age increases (P = 0.014) and the duration of the disease increases (P = 0.041), the level of depression increases significantly. People with higher education had lower depression (P = 0.001) and anxiety (P = 0.003). People living in the city had a significantly better quality of life (P = 0.039). The higher the depression (P < 0.0001) and anxiety (P = 0.037) of the people, the lower the quality of life of the patients. CONCLUSION: As anxiety and depression increase, the quality of life of lung neoplasm patients decreases. Some demographic characteristics such as old age, insufficient education, rurality, and increased duration of the disease can be the risk factors for depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life of patients with lung neoplasm.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis study was performed to evaluate the ability of three diffusion models to diagnose PCa from the scientific electronic databases Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (ISI) for the period up to March 2022 to identify all relevant articles. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the systematic review section (7 diffusion kurtosis imaging [DKI] studies, 4 diffusion tensor imaging [DTI] studies, 4 intravoxel incoherent motion [IVIM] studies, and 3 IVIM-DKI studies). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and summary area under each diffusion model's curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The pooled accuracy and 95% CI on detection (differentiation of tumor from normal tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia/prostatitis) were obtained for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at 87.97% (84.56%-91.38%) for DKI parameters (Gaussian diffusion [DK] 87.94% [78.71%-97.16%] and deviation from Gaussian diffusion [K] 86.84% [81.83%-91.85%]) and IVIM parameters (true molecular diffusion [DIVIM] 81.73% [72.54%-90.91%], perfusion-related diffusion [D*] 65% [48.47%-81.53%] and perfusion fraction [f] 80.36% [64.23%-96.48%]). The AUC values and 95% CI in the detection of PCa were obtained for ADC at 0.95 (0.92-0.97), for DKI parameters (DK 0.94 [0.89-0.99] and K 0.93 [0.90-0.96]) and for IVIM parameters (DIVIM 0.85 [0.80-0.91], D* 0.60 [0.43-0.77] and f 0.73 [0.63-0.84]). Two studies showed that the DTI accuracy values were 97.34% and 85%. For IVIM-kurtosis model in PCa detection, two studies stated that the DIVIM-K and KIVIM-K accuracy values were 85% and 84.44% (the pooled accuracy; 84.64% with 95% CI 75.78%-93.50%), and 72.50% and 71.11% (the pooled accuracy, 72.10% with 95% CI 64.73%-79.48%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that among the DKI, IVIM, and ADC parameters, it seems that ADC, Dk, DIVIM, and K are the most important, which can be used as an indicator to distinguish PCa from normal tissue. The DKI model probably has a higher ability to detect PCa from normal tissue than the IVIM model. DKI probably has the same diagnostic performance in PCa detection and grading compared to diffusion-weighted imaging and ADC.",

Perioperative oral management aims to remove oral foci of infection. However, the type of oral care that can reduce the salivary bacterial load remains unclear. This study aimed to identify factors influencing salivary bacterial counts during the perioperative period in patients with malignant tumors and to evaluate the effectiveness of tooth brushing and povidone-iodine mouthwash in reducing oral bacterial counts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged ≥18 years who underwent surgery under general anesthesia for malignant solid tumors other than head and neck cancer were included. Participants were randomly assigned to the brushing or povidone-iodine mouthwash groups. Factors such as sex, age, primary disease, preoperative blood-test results, oral functional metrics, and salivary bacterial counts were analyzed. Saliva samples were collected before and on the day after surgery, both before and after oral-care interventions. The total bacterial and streptococcal counts were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and delayed real-time PCR was used to determine the viable bacterial count. RESULTS: Postoperatively, the salivary bacterial counts increased slightly. Significant factors affecting postoperative bacterial counts included high preoperative counts and postoperative fasting status. Brushing increased salivary bacterial counts, whereas the povidone-iodine mouthwash decreased them. CONCLUSION: Poor preoperative oral hygiene and postoperative fasting were significantly associated with increased salivary bacterial counts.

This study investigates the effects of red-lime and white-lime betel quid extracts on oral cell lines, focusing on cytotoxicity and their influence on fibronectin and Type I collagen expression, which were crucial for oral tissue integrity and cancer development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four oral cell lines, human gingival fibroblasts, tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells, human periodontal ligament fibroblasts, and human fetal osteoblasts, were treated with red-lime and white-lime betel quid extracts. Cytotoxicity assays and Western blotting were used to assess cell viability and protein expression. RESULTS: Both red-lime and white-lime betel quid extracts exhibited dose-dependent effects on all tested cell lines, with variations in sensitivity observed among cell types. Notably, red-lime betel quid exerted stronger cytotoxic effects on human gingival fibroblasts and human fetal osteoblasts. Red-lime betel quid increased fibronectin and Type I collagen in periodontal ligament fibroblasts but reduced both proteins in fetal osteoblasts. White-lime betel quid extract generally elevated fibronectin and decreased Type I collagen across cell lines. CONCLUSION: This study reveals a nuanced, concentration-dependent impact of betel quid extracts on oral cells, with significant variability in cytotoxicity and changes in fibronectin and Type I collagen expression. These findings suggest that abrupt cessation of betel quid chewing can lead to dental issues such as mobile teeth.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Epidemiologic research has linked periodontitis to several types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. Although clinical evidence indicates a higher risk of breast cancer in women with periodontitis than in those without, few studies have explored whether the risk of periodontitis is higher in women with breast cancer than in those without. In this study, we examined the incidence of periodontitis in patients with breast cancer and identified potential interventions for its prevention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. We identified women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer between 2010 and 2019 and included a 1:1 matched control cohort with no breast cancer. Subsequently, we analyzed the risk of periodontitis by using Cox proportional-hazards models while adjusting for sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: In 82,146 matched pairs, the breast cancer cohort was at a 51 % higher risk of periodontitis compared with the control cohort (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.51, 95 % confidence interval = 1.43-1.60). The stratified analysis revealed the same results. The risk of breast cancer was higher in younger patients than in older patients, whereas the risk of periodontitis was significantly lower in patients who underwent surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy compared with those who did not. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer increases the risk of periodontitis, particularly in younger patients. These patients should receive regular dental care to prevent and manage periodontitis. Anticancer treatments may mitigate the risk of periodontitis in patients with breast cancer.",

Recurrence of herniation is a common cause of poor outcomes and the need for revision surgery, which occurs in as many as 21% of patients following primary discectomy. Identifying factors that are associated with the recurrence of herniation may be valuable for risk stratification and patient counseling. This study aimed to explore the relationship between various patient demographic variables and comorbidities and rates of reoperation after primary lumbar microdiscectomy. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients who were undergoing single-level primary lumbar microdiscectomy between 2016 and 2022. Eligibility for inclusion was determined by age >18 years and current procedural terminology codes 63030 and 63042. Patients with preoperative sepsis or cancer were excluded. Patient demographics, including age, race, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI), and various comorbidities were compared between cohorts. To determine factors independently associated with the need for revision microdiscectomy, multivariable Poisson regressions were utilized. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 65,121 primary discectomy patients were included, with a separate cohort of 6,971 patients undergoing revision discectomy. In comparison with primary patients, the revision cohort was older and had higher proportions of female and non-Hispanic White patients (all c0.001). The odds ratio for revision discectomy was greater in patients aged ≥65 years (1.577, 95% CI [1.480, 1.680]) than in those aged <45 years (p>0.001). The odds ratio for revision was lower in Black (0.821, 95% CI [0.738, 0.914]) and Hispanic patients (0.819, 95% CI [0.738, 0.909]) when compared with non-Hispanic White patients (p<0.001). Obese patients with BMI ≥35 (1.193, 95% CI [1.103, 1.290]) were at greater risk of revision than those with BMI <25 (p<0.001). Diabetes (1.326, 95% CI [1.242, 1.416], p<0.001), functional dependence (1.411, 95% CI [1.183, 1.683], p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (1.315, 95% CI [1.137, 1.512], p<0.001), hypertension (1.398, 95% CI [1.330, 1.470], p<0.001), and smoking (1.082, 95% CI [1.018, 1.151], p=0.012) were associated with greater risk of revision. Poisson log-linear regression demonstrated sex (χ 2=19.9, p<0.001), race (χ 2=39.5, p<0.001), diabetes (χ 2=10.1, p=0.001), smoking (χ 2=18.5, p<0.001), hypertension (χ 2=16.4, p<0.001), age (χ 2=102.4, p<0.001), and BMI (χ 2=4.7, p=0.029) as significant predictors of revision, with steroid use (χ 2=3.5, p=0.061) and functional status (χ 2=3.7, p=0.055) approaching significance. CONCLUSIONS: Patient demographics, comorbidities, and rehabilitative status may be significantly associated with rates of reherniation and revision surgery following lumbar microdiscectomy. We found that the significant predictors of revision surgery are functional dependence, advanced age, male sex, White race, obesity, diabetes, smoking, and hypertension. Early identification and attendance to the modifiable risk factors will aid patient guidance and outcomes following primary lumbar microdiscectomy.",

Literature is scant about the incidence of RILSP after a neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy (RT) in rectal cancer. In this report, we detail the symptoms, signs, and management of RILSP. Volumetric modulated arc therapy was used for delivering preoperative short-course RT in our rectal cancer patient. Six months after the completion of RT, the patient presented with symptoms of lower extremity motor and sensory impairment. An electrodiagnostic study revealed a pattern of bilateral sciatic nerve injury or a lower lumbosacral plexus abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging showed radiation-related edema in the region of the lumbosacral plexus. Further blood and serum investigations ruled out other inflammatory and infectious differential diagnoses, thus a diagnosis of RILSP was made. He was initiated on analgesics and was also referred to physiotherapy and rehabilitation. After 2 months, his symptoms stabilized.",

    "AbstractText": "Pancreatic cancer is associated with a poor prognosis despite multimodal treatments. To improve the efficacy of radiotherapy, the use of nanoscintillators is emerging. Made of high-Z elements, they absorb X-rays more efficiently than tissues and can locally enhance the radiation dose provided they have accumulated near tumor cells. This study focuses on the role of the coating, a key parameter that controls both in vitro and in vivo properties of nanoparticles, including their internalization, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy. Polyethylene glycol and tripolyphosphate molecules are used to coat lanthanum fluoride nanoscintillators, and their properties are evaluated on pancreatic cancer models. The experiments demonstrate a higher internalization of the nanoparticles when coated with tripolyphosphate, in both 2D and 3D culture models, correlating with greater efficacy under X-rays, which may be associated with higher radiation dose-enhancement. The nanoparticles are also injected intravenously in healthy or tumor-bearing mice in order to study their toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution. Despite a strong liver and spleen accumulation, especially for the tripolyphosphate-coated nanoparticles, no toxicity is observed for either coating. Because they show promising radiation dose-enhancement in vitro in both culture models and a limited toxicity in vivo, polyethylene glycol-coated nanoparticles are good candidates for biomedical applications.",

    "AbstractText": "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a major challenge in oncology due to its highly invasive nature and limited treatment options. GBM's aggressive migration beyond tumor margins and rapid tumor growth hinders success in patient treatment. Localized therapeutic delivery, such as the use of transition metals like copper, is highlighted as a novel therapeutic agent for many potential biomedical applications. Herein, it is aimed to study the effects of Cu release on the proliferation and invasiveness of cancer cells. To this end, novel copper-based nanostructures with different release patterns are designed. Using a complex 3D cell culture model to mimic the tumor microenvironment, it is shown that different patterns of copper ion release have a strong impact on GBM progression and invasiveness. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing localized copper release patterns to tailor different tumor treatment strategies. They also show the potential and suitability of 3D microchips as instruments to study the behavior of tumor spheroids. In spite of their limitations, these 3D microdevices enable a controlled and close monitoring of the influence of environmental factors (such as the presence of Cu ions) on the proliferation and invasiveness of the cells, with a better approach to reality compared to 2D models and with a more controlled environment, compared to an in vivo model.",

    "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a postoperative recurrence rate of up to 50%. Local treatment at the surgical site offers a new strategy to prevent recurrence, minimizing systemic side effects. However, these treatments often face issues like poor stability, insufficient targeting, and significant local side effects. Research shows glucose starvation can induce disulfidptosis, a novel cell death pathway, in CRC cells, suitable for precise intervention in residual tumor cells postsurgery. This study develops a biocompatible 2D therapeutic platform using amyloid-like protein nanofilm technology for precise local synergistic intervention in disulfidptosis and photodynamic therapy (PDT) after CRC surgery. The nanofilm boasts excellent drug-loading capacity, enzyme activity retention, ultrathin dimensions, wet adhesion, and biocompatibility. A model simulating incomplete tumor resection post-CRC surgery shows that the GCI@nanofilm effectively inhibits recurrence through an enzyme-catalyzed cascade reaction inducing disulfidptosis and synergizing with PDT. In summary, GCI@nanofilm overcomes multiple challenges in local postsurgical intervention, providing a foundation for precise and efficient treatment of residual tumors.",

ITC@ZrO(TocP)/ZrO(FdUMP) core@shell nanocarriers (designated ITC-FdUMP-NC) with the clinically relevant chemotherapeutics irinotecan (ITC) and fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FdUMP) (active derivative of 5'-fluorouracil/5-FU) are a new type of nanocarrier with high drug payload (22 wt% of lipophilic ITC: particle core; 10 wt% of hydrophilic FdUMP: particle shell). The nanocarriers are tested in different CRC cell lines, a normal cell line, and rectal cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Fluorescence-labeled nanocarriers show efficient uptake by all CRC cells and allow to distinctly track the intracellular trafficking toward endolysosomal compartments. Although free chemotherapeutic drugs exhibit a greater potency in 2D cell cultures, ITC-FdUMP-NC demonstrate equivalent cytotoxic efficacies as the freely dissolved drugs in the more complex 3D rectal cancer PDOs. The sustained drug-release profile of the nanocarriers contrasts favorably with conventional free drugs, potentially enhancing the therapeutic outcome in vivo. With a chemotherapeutic cocktail comparable to the clinically applied FOLFIRI (ITC + 5-FU), the ITC-FdUMP-NC represent a novel type of nanocarrier with high anti-tumor effect and high drug payload, offering a promising strategy to circumvent chemoresistance and to improve therapy efficacy in vivo with less side effects.",

    "AbstractText": "Nitric oxide (•NO) plays various pathophysiological roles in breast cancer, significantly influencing the migration of tumour cells through concentration gradients. Therefore, modulating •NO levels via selective scavenging presents a promising approach to treating aggressive •NO-dependent cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Hemin emerges as a potential scavenger of •NO; however, its metalloporphyrin molecules tend to aggregate in physiological solutions, which limits its biomedical applications. To address this, a modification strategy is employed to minimize aggregation and protect against physiological oxidative degradation while preserving •NO-scavenging properties. This is achieved through a simple chemical transformation that involves hemin conjugation to aromatic residues, tyrosine, and tyramine via carbodiimide reactions. These derivatives exhibit altered electronic properties and oxidation potential compared to hemin, alongside reduced aggregation tendencies and retained •NO-binding affinity in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, depending on the type of hemin derivative, there is an associated inhibition of TNBC cell migration. These model hemin compounds demonstrate varying •NO-binding affinities and resistance levels to oxidative degradation and aggregation, offering insights into the design of •NO-scavenging molecules with enhanced properties for cancer treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), an albumin-bound solvent-free paclitaxel (PTX) formulation that takes advantage of the endogenous albumin transport pathway, is the current gold standard for treatment of solid tumors with PTX. However, nab-paclitaxel has several limitations, including complex manufacturing, immunogenicity, slow drug-release, and a narrow therapeutic window. Nevertheless, no other PTX formulation has gained the Food and Drug Administration approval since Abraxane's 18-year reign. Addressing these concerns, herein, a PTX-loaded nanoparticle of a recombinant polypeptide that-like nab-paclitaxel-capitalizes on the long in vivo half-life of albumin is reported. This genetically engineered nanoparticle packages PTX in the core of the nanoparticle and displays an albumin-binding domain on the exterior of the nanoparticle. Upon in vivo administration, the drug-loaded nanoparticle binds albumin with nanomolar affinity, and acquires an albumin-corona, which eliminates the need to use exogenous albumin. The nanoparticles can be stored at subzero temperature as lyophilized powder without any cryoprotectants for upto a year and can be reconstituted on-demand in aqueous buffer at high concentration, thus greatly simplifying formulation processes. These albumin-binding nanoparticles improve the therapeutic window by at least twofold compared to nonalbumin-binding counterpart and outperform nab-paclitaxel in multiple murine tumor models, results that have been independently replicated by a contract research organization.",

    "AbstractText": "Ferroptosis can serve as a potent strategy for regulating cell death via lipid peroxidation and the imbalance of the antioxidant system resulting from iron accumulation in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy. However, the ferroptosis accompanied with down-regulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) lead to CD36-mediated tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells uptaking fatty acids, resulting in the negative action on immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, the albumin nanoparticles, abbreviated as LHS NPs, were designed by co-assembly of hemin, linoleic acid-cystamine, and a CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccinimide oleate, to bi-directionally manipulated ferroptosis in tumor and CD8+ T cells for TNBC therapy. LHS NPs exerted more efficient reactive oxygen species generation, glutathione depletion and malondialdehyde production by the combinatory strategy of classical and non-classical ferroptosis modes, which amplified the positive action on ferroptosis in tumor cells. Meanwhile, LHS manipulated the negative action of ferroptosis by inhibiting the CD36 mediated-lipid peroxidation in CD8+ T cells, thereby activating the immunotherapeutic efficacy with the improvements on induction of immunogenic cell death, proliferation of CD4+CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, alleviation immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and repolarization of the M2- to M1-phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Thus, LHS NPs demonstrated an improved antitumor efficacy in suppressing the tumor growth and lung metastasis of 4T1-tumor mice. Our work gives novel insights for the bi-directionally manipulating ferroptosis in tumor and CD8+ T cells on TNBC chemoimmunotherapy.",

Additionally, we sought to identify risk factors for severe AEs associated with these treatment regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we included 359 patients diagnosed with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were treated with docetaxel. We analyzed patient demographics, hematologic and non-hematologic AEs, and risk factors for severe AEs. Logistic regression models were used to assess risk factors. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the incidence of ≥ grade 3 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia (FN) between the triplet and docetaxel-based therapy groups when stratified by the use of primary prophylaxis. Non-hematologic AEs, especially fatigue, were more frequent in the mCRPC group compared to the triplet therapy group. Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) significantly reduced the risk of severe neutropenia (odds ratio [OR] 0.092, P < 0.001) and FN (OR 0.13, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: This study represents the first real-world analysis comparing the adverse event profiles of triplet therapy and docetaxel-based therapy in Japanese patients with mCSPC, as well as docetaxel-based therapy in those with mCRPC. No significant difference in severe AEs was observed between the therapies. Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF proved critical in reducing severe neutropenia and FN, underscoring its importance in enhancing the safety and efficacy of docetaxel-based therapies.",

Fluoroquinolone-type antibiotics are no longer acceptable in the EU. Fosfomycin-trometamol may be used, but there is no evidence regarding its ideal dose and administration time. METHODS: Patients who underwent prostate biopsy between 2021 and 2023 were evaluated prospectively. 204 patients were randomized into two arms: 102 patients (Arm A) received a single-dose of fosfomycin-trometamol one hour before surgery, and 102 patients (Arm B) received one additional dose of fosfomycin-trometamol 48 hours after the first dose. Urine tests and questionnaires were administered during the postoperative period and the subsequent four weeks to identify any symptoms, infectious, or other complications. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria (4.90% (5) vs. 8.82% (9), P = 0.27) symptomatic urinary tract infection (0% (0) vs. 1.96% (2), P = 0.50), or febrile urinary tract infection (0% (0) vs. 0.98% (1), P = 1) between the groups.

This study aimed to assess the potential predictive factors associated with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT positivity following persistent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and primary biochemical recurrence post-radical prostatectomy (RP), focusing on prostate specimen characteristics. Furthermore, we aim to identify predictive factors for locoregional recurrence. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 230 prostate cancer patients treated with RP and without prior salvage or adjuvant radiotherapy or systemic treatments. All patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans to detect prostate cancer recurrence detection. Pathological findings were carefully examined and correlated with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT positivity and locoregional recurrence. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT positivity was associated with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group ≥3, presence of positive lymph node invasion at the time of RP, positive extra-prostatic extension, involvement of seminal vesicles and post-RP PSA levels ≥0.1 ng/ml. Additionally, we identified ISUP grade group 2 and ISUP grade group ≥3, whether with or without positive lymph node invasion, along with extra-prostatic extension, involvement of seminal vesicles and post-RP PSA ≥0.1 ng/ml were identified as factors associated with pelvic node recurrence. CONCLUSION: Pathological findings emerge as robust predictors of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT positivity and locoregional recurrences in cases of initial biochemical recurrence or persistence without prior adjuvant or salvage treatment. This diagnostic approach facilitates potential adjustments in management strategies, such as PSMA-guided radiotherapy or PSMA-guided lymphadenectomy.",

We intend to identify the causal connections between the gut microbiota and prostatic diseases and investigate the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to elucidate the impact of 196 gut microbiota on prostatic diseases risk. Reverse MR, linkage disequilibrium regression score (LDSC), and colocalization analyses were performed to strengthen causal evidence. Phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) analysis was used to evaluate the potential side effects of targeting the detected gut microbiota. We designed a two-step MR study to assess the mediating effects of sex hormones, blood metabolites, and proteins. RESULTS: According to the MR analyses, 31 bacterial taxa were causally associated with prostatic diseases, of which 23 types were newly identified. In addition, Alphaproteobacteria restrained prostate cancer, Ruminococcaceae UCG009 prevented prostatitis, and Clostridiales posed a risk for benign prostatic hyperplasia. LDSC and colocalization analyses indicated that the detected associations were not confounded by genetic correlation or LD from common causal loci. In the mediation analysis, we identified 53 mediators linking the gut microbiota to prostatic diseases, with a specific emphasis on the critical roles played by sex hormones and blood metabolites, and identified 34 proteins that may be used as therapeutic targets, especially FGFR1 and XPNPEP1.

The prognostic impact of primary tumor progression was examined along with other clinical parameters. Castration-resistant prostate cancer progression-free survival (CRPC PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed as clinical outcomes. Student's t-test, Cox proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier methods were utilized to validate the clinical significance. RESULTS: The median age and initial prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) values were 74 and 221 ng/ml, respectively. 632 (64%) and 355 (36%) patients had clinical T stage ≤3 and 4 at diagnosis, respectively. mHSPC patients with clinical T stage 4 were more likely to have a higher grade group (GG), higher frequency of lymph node metastasis, lower hemoglobin (Hb), and more high-volume/risk disease in comparison with those with clinical T stage ≤3. Patients with cT4 were associated with shorter CRPC PFS (P=0.0002) and OS (P < 0.0001).

However, it is unclear if the utilization of this approach represents an improvement over inpatient robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (I-RARP). This meta-analysis sought to compare the surgical outcomes between O-RARP and I-RARP. METHODS: For relevant articles, three electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched from their inception until April 30, 2022. A meta-analysis has been reported in line with PRISMA 2020 and AMSTAR guidelines. The risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (MD) were applied for the comparison of dichotomous and continuous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: of the 297 retrieved abstracts, 12 underwent full-text review, and 11 studies were included in the final analysis, comprising a total cohort of 2,875 cases of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (892 O-RARP cases and 1,983 I-RARP cases). Compared to I-RARP, the O-RARP group had lower mean operative time (MD = -9.4 minutes, 95% CI -15.1 to -3.7, P = 0.001), fewer overall postoperative complications (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92, P = 0.017), shorter hospital stay (MD = -22.9 hours, 95% CI -26.0 to -19.7, P ≤ 0.001), and lower postoperative opioid requirements (RR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.71, P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in other outcomes, including: estimated blood loss, postoperative pain score, unscheduled visits after surgery, positive surgical margins, biochemical recurrence, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) after surgery, or three- and six-month continence rates. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that O-RARP is a safe and feasible option for patients undergoing surgery for localized prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who received apalutamide across 18 institutions in Korea, with a follow-up period of at least three months. A total of 218 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 214 patients analyzed, 78 (36.4%) developed a skin rash. The severity of the rash was classified as grade 1 (G1) in 27 patients (12.6%), grade 2 (G2) in 29 patients (13.5%), and grade 3 (G3) in 22 patients (10.3%). The median time to onset of any skin rash was 65.5 days (interquartile range, IQR 31.0-88.0). The monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and systemic immune-inflammation response index (SIRI) were significantly higher in the G2 plus G3 group compared to the no rash plus G1 group (p=0.006, p=0.013, respectively) before apalutamide treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world cohort of Korean patients, skin rash occurred in 36.4% of cases, with a median time to onset of 65.5 days. Grade 3 skin rash developed in 10.3% of cases. While MLR and SIRI were significantly higher in the G2 plus G3 group, these markers cannot be considered reliable predictors due to a low area under the curve (AUC < 0.7) before apalutamide treatment. However, increased levels of PLR, SII, and SIRI could potentially be useful for monitoring for the risk of severe rash development in these patients.",

Logistic regression identified elevated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status (ECOG-PS) and hypoalbuminemia as significant predictors of dAEs. ROC analysis for serum albumin levels produced an area under the curve of 0.739, with a cutoff value of 3.85 g/dL, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 65.4% and 74.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: dAEs are prevalent in Korean patients treated with apalutamide for mHSPC, with ECOG-PS and serum albumin levels identified as significant risk factors.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Cherenkov Imaged Bio-Morphological Features Verify Patient Positioning With Deformable Tissue Translocation in Breast Radiation Therapy.",
    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Accurate patient positioning is crucial for precise radiation therapy dose delivery, as errors in positioning can profoundly influence treatment outcomes. This study introduces a novel application for loco-regional tissue deformation tracking via Cherenkov image analysis during fractionated breast cancer radiation therapy. The primary objective of this research was to develop and test an algorithmic method for Cherenkov-based position accuracy quantification, particularly for loco-regional deformations, which do not have an ideal method for quantification during radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Bio-morphological features in the Cherenkov images, such as vessels, were segmented. A rigid/nonrigid combined registration technique was employed to pinpoint both inter- and intrafractional positioning variations. The methodology was tested on an anthropomorphic chest phantom experiment via shifting a treatment couch with known distances and inducing respiratory motion to simulate interfraction setup uncertainties and intrafraction motions, respectively. It was then applied to a data set of fractionated whole breast radiation therapy human imaging (n = 10 patients). RESULTS: The methodology provided quantified positioning variations comprising 2 components: a global shift determined through rigid registration and a 2-dimensional variation map illustrating loco-regional tissue deformation quantified via nonrigid registration. Controlled phantom testing yielded an average accuracy of 0.83 mm for couch translations up to 20 mm in various directions. Analysis of clinical Cherenkov imaging data from 10 breast cancer patients compared with their first imaged fraction revealed an interfraction setup variation of 3.7 ± 2.4 mm in the global shift and loco-regional deformation up to 3.3 ± 1.9 mm (95th percentile of all regional deformation). CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces the use of Cherenkov visualized bio-morphological features to quantify the global and local variations in patient positioning based on rigid and nonrigid registrations. This new approach demonstrates the feasibility of providing quantitative guidance for inter/intrafraction positioning, particularly for the loco-regional deformations that have been unappreciated in current practice with conventional imaging techniques.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Neurotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic drug \"methotrexate\": a literature review.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate (MTX) is currently considered the go-to drug in chemotherapy, although it possesses neurological dangers. In this review paper, research and records of MTX-induced neurotoxicity in different types of adult and pediatric cancers will be discussed. The general description and function of MTX are still not completely known. How biological ratios in the body fluctuate with low and high methotrexate doses are still unknown as well. Therefore, this is a hot topic for experts, especially those active in neuro-oncology research. Scientists and physicians are now using different protocols to understand, control, manage, and prevent MTX-neurotoxic events. AIM: By evaluating various studies, case reports, and clinical trials, this comprehensive review seeks to clarify the mechanisms underlying MTX-induced neurotoxicity, highlight potential strategies for prevention and management, and guide future research in mitigating the adverse neurological effects of MTX treatment. METHODS: Several databases were employed to gather this information, mainly PubMed. RESULTS: The precise mechanisms of MTX-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. Multiple hypotheses suggest involvement of genes related to neurogenesis, but no definitive cause has been identified. Regular patient monitoring, long-term follow-up, variable therapies, and early MRI detection are recommended. CONCLUSION: Despite advancements, no longitudinal studies have conclusively determined effective strategies to prevent MTX-induced neurotoxicity. Demographic factors and cancer types do not consistently predict neurotoxicity. Future research should focus on genetic counseling prior to chemotherapy, targeted monitoring protocols, and long-term patient follow-up to better understand and mitigate the neurotoxic impacts of MTX. Pharmacokinetics and advanced neuroimaging techniques are also essential for improving patient outcomes.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer metastasis to the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is extremely rare and often misdiagnosed preoperatively. The clinical characteristics and prognosis of this uncommon condition remain largely unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 68-year-old male who presented with recurrent headaches, dizziness, and gait disturbances. The patient had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma two years prior. Preoperative imaging suggested a right CPA meningioma. The patient underwent resection of the CPA tumor under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology revealed a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Despite treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient developed widespread metastatic disease and succumbed 2 months after the CPA tumor resection. DISCUSSION: The rarity of pancreatic cancer metastasizing to the CPA presents diagnostic challenges, as evidenced by the initial misdiagnosis of meningioma in this case. The clinical presentation can mimic benign conditions, leading to delays in appropriate management. This case underscores the importance of considering metastatic disease in patients with a history of cancer, even when presenting with symptoms typical of more common CPA lesions. CONCLUSION: Vigilant monitoring is crucial in pancreatic cancer patients, as neurological symptoms may herald metastatic spread to uncommon sites like the CPA. Despite surgical intervention, widespread metastasis can lead to poor outcomes. Early diagnosis and a high index of suspicion are essential for optimal management of these rare cases.",

    "AbstractText": "Lung cancer cells resistant to radiotherapy present a significant clinical challenge. Stable telomeric structures, maintained by the TRF2 protein, play a critical role in protecting cells from ionizing radiation. Reduced TRF2 expression increases DNA damage and radiosensitivity. We designed a self-assembling system utilizing ultra-small luminescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with radiosensitizing properties, combined with siRNA targeting TRF2. The system forms ≈100  nm non-spherical structures with AuNCs enriched in the outer layer, exhibiting a 17.6-fold enhancement in red photoluminescence due to aggregation-induced effects. This nanoplatform efficiently penetrates lung cancer cells, reducing TRF2 expression by 50%. Under 5 Gy radiotherapy, cells treated with this system show a 1.5-fold radiosensitivity increase from AuNCs and a 2.3-fold reduction in clonogenic survival due to telomere deprotection. The AuNC-siRNATRF2 system combines enhanced optical properties with biological functionality, offering a promising approach to augment radiotherapy efficacy by disrupting telomeric protective mechanisms in cancer cells.",

    "AbstractText": "Nanoparticle-based drug carrier systems with active targeting and a controlled release capacity are of considerable interest to bypass side effects of conventional chemotherapy. One appealing approach involves chemotherapeutic-loaded photothermal nanoparticles, where laser irradiation can release the loaded anticancer drug while also inducing local cytotoxicity through photothermal effects. This study investigates the potential of using nanosecond-pulsed laser light for efficient and specific killing of folate receptor (FR)-overexpressing cancer cells in combination with FR-targeted doxorubicin-loaded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation allows the induction of mechanical forces alongside thermal effects. The effect of nanoparticle concentrations and laser fluences on cytotoxicity is systematically tested, achieving near-complete tumor cell killing under the most stringent conditions. FR targeting is confirmed using FR-positive and -negative cell lines, showing that folic acid functionalization of AuNPs results in more favorable nanoparticle-cell interactions and more efficient photothermal effects. Additionally, doxorubicin could be efficiently released from the AuNPs and endosomal compartments upon laser irradiation, adding to the observed cytotoxicity. Cell killing was precisely confined to irradiated cells, leaving surrounding cells unharmed. Overall, the significant reduction of tumor cell viability following the proposed combination demonstrates this approach to be a promising step toward safer, more effective anticancer therapies.",

In this study, a novel 3D-nanoplasmonic-based multiplex mutation assay chip is developed to detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. This assay kit comprises a 3D-nanoplasmonic substrate immobilized with capture probes and primer-probe sets for recombinase polymerase amplification, wild-type inhibition, and fluorescence detection, enabling multiplex detection of EGFR exon 19 deletions, exon 20 insertions, and exon 21 L858R point mutations. The strategy facilitates the detection of all deletions and insertions within the target region with extremely high analytical sensitivity, detecting as low as 1 × 10-9% mutation frequency, implying three copies/reactions and 100 zM. The synergistic effects of plasmon-enhanced fluorescence from the 3D-nanoplasmonic substrate and wild-type inhibitor contribute to this high analytical sensitivity. Moreover, the developed chip exhibits 100% accuracy in the clinical testing of plasma samples from normal individuals and patients with benign lung tumor and malignant lung tumor. With high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities, this assay operates at a low reaction temperature (around 37 °C) and requires a short processing time, ≈70 min post-cell-free DNA extraction.

    "AbstractText": "Cancer chemotherapy using natural phytochemicals, especially including isoflavone biochanin A (BCA), has attracted considerable attention because of the potent antitumor therapeutic effect and excellent biosafety. However, the preclinical application of BCA is still generally limited by its poor water solubility and low biological availability. To overcome these important limitations, a tumor targetable hemicyanine-based near-infrared (NIR) theranostic agent is rationally designed and prepared to improve the water solubility, tumor targetability, and antitumor activity of BCA. A key point to enhance the tumor targeting efficiency of BCA is the combination of a tumor-targeted water-soluble zwitterionic NIR fluorophore (ZW800-Cl) and BCA to create the hemicyanine structure, named BCA-ZW. Owing to the long-wavelength emission (>750 nm) and large Stokes shift (72 nm) of BCA-ZW, the in vivo performance of BCA-ZW is effectively monitored. The molecularly engineered BCA-ZW not only exhibits high targeting ability to HT-29 xenograft tumors but also induces high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the tumor tissues. Therefore, the fluorescence-guided chemotherapy by BCA-ZW to the tumor-bearing mouse model achieves the enhanced antitumor effect of BCA. This work provides a simple but effective strategy to design NIR fluorescent phytoflavonoids as potential therapeutic agents for further biomedical applications.",

This study implements in vitro 3D cocultures, so-called microtissues, to model a physiologically relevant tumor microenvironment (TME) to examine the impact of surface-modified MSNs without targeting ligands on the internalization, cargo delivery, and cargo release in tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Among these, acetylated MSNs most effectively localized in tumor cells in a 3D setting containing collagen, while other MSNs did so to a lesser degree, most likely due to remaining trapped in the extracellular matrix of the TME. Confocal imaging of hydrophobic model drug-loaded MSNs demonstrated effective cargo release predominantly in tumor cells, both in 2D and 3D cocultures. MSN-mediated delivery of an anticancer drug in the microtissues exhibited a significant reduction in tumor organoid size and enhanced the tumor-specific cytotoxic effects of a γ-secretase inhibitor, compared to the highly hydrophobic drug in free form.

Herein, single-cell analysis of two cell lines in response to megavolt irradiation and a radiomimetic drug, neocarzinostatin (NCS) after coculture with gold NPs with different surface coatings, polyethylene glycol (AuPEG), PEG, and transferrin (AuT) or silica (AuSiO2), is reported. Different surface chemistry presents a major challenge for objective comparison between the biological impacts where major differences in cell-uptake exist. AuSiO2 NPs are the most efficient for promoting radiosensitization despite being associated with cells 10 times less than the actively targeted AuT NPs. Conversely, for cells exposed to NCS, AuSiO2 NPs impede the radiomimetic action and promote cell survival. AuT NPs enhance death of cells in combination with NCS showing that NPs can sensitize against cytotoxic agents in addition to radiation. While NPs contribute to radiosensitization (or enhancing/impeding chemotherapeutic drug activity), due to cell and cell line heterogeneity, the ultimate radiosensitivity of a cell appears to be dominated by its inherent radiosensitivity and how this cell-regulated response is manipulated by NPs. This is evidenced through comparison of radiobiological response of cells with equivalent NP association rather than equivalent coculture conditions.",

Based on our previous results revealing its role in mitosis in glioblastoma, we have examined its effect in pancreatic cancer, which is often linked to mitotic aberrations including aneuploidy and chromosome instability. Here, we show that the expression of α-Fodrin increases in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues compared to its normal counterpart, suggesting its tumor promoting role. shRNA-mediated knock-down of α-Fodrin significantly reduces the xenograft growth in immunocompromised mice underscoring the importance of α-Fodrin in tumor progression. CENP-E (centromere-associated protein E) is a motor protein essential for chromosomal alignment and segregation during mitosis. We have found that α-Fodrin interacts with CENP-E to recruit it to the kinetochore and depletion of α-Fodrin has a crucial role in controlling aneuploidy. As these mitotic defects can lead to apoptosis, we have further evaluated the activation of possible upstream pathways. Paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent that stabilizes microtubules, disrupts mitosis and induces apoptosis. We found that Paclitaxel triggered stronger activation of JNK, ERK, and P38 MAPKs, altered BCL2/BAX ratios, cytochrome C release causing increased apoptosis in α-Fodrin knockdown cells compared to cells with wild-type α-Fodrin. This enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel is consistent with improved survival in pancreatic cancer patients with low α-Fodrin (SPTAN1) and low CENP-E expression compared to poor prognosis with high expressions of both the genes. Taken together, this study provides the molecular mechanism by which α-Fodrin - CENP-E axis regulates pancreatic cancer progression and drug response.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The new FIGO 2023 staging reclassification of patients with FIGO 2009 Stage IVB endometrial cancer correlates to progression-free and overall survival outcomes.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the oncological outcomes of Stage IVB (FIGO 2009) Endometrial cancer patients and its comparison with the new (FIGO 2023) staging. METHODS: A Retrospective analysis was conducted between May 30, 2011, and December 30, 2020 on all patients with stage IVB (FIGO 2009 Staging) endometrial cancer. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome. Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and comparison with new staging FIGO 2023 were the secondary outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to compare the average OS time and PFS between the groups. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with Stage IVB endometrial cancer (2009 FIGO Staging) were included. Median age was 68 years. Serous histology was found in 24 (47.1 %) patients. After a median follow-up period of 24 months, median OS was 36 months and median PFS was 15 months. FIGO 2023 staging criteria reclassified the stages of 23 patients (45 %). Patients were restaged into Stage IIIB2 (9.8 %), IVA (5.8 %), IVB (55 %) and IVC (29.4 %). Median OS and PFS were not reached for stages IIIB and IVA, while the median OS and median PFS for stage IVB were 36 months and 18 months, respectively. However, patients with stage IVC had lower median OS and PFS of 10 months and 4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: The clinical outcomes of patients with Stage IVB are varied depending mainly on the disease distribution. Patients with abdominal or pelvic disease had better survival outcomes and therefore, needed a different categorisation. Thus, FIGO 2023 Staging considers this varied disease distribution and appears to be a better prognostic indicator for this group.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Prevalence and genotype distribution of high-risk Human Papillomavirus infection among Vietnamese women in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam: A population-based cross-sectional study.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Persistent infection with high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes are wellknown to increase the risk of cervical cancer significantly. This study aims to determine the prevalence and distribution of high-risk HR-HPV genotypes among women in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Viet Nam. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2020 and September 2020 in all 24 districts of HCMC, Viet Nam. Socio-demographic and behavioral data were collected from 2478 women aged 25 to 65 who had sexual intercourse using a self-administered questionnaire. Vaginal swab specimens from all participants were collected to identify HR-HPV genotypes using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) protocols. RESULTS: The prevalence of HR-HPV infection was 3.5 % (87 women, including 20 cases infected with multi-genotypes), 3.1 % in urban and 0.4 % in rural areas. The most detected HR-HPV genotypes among positive cases were 58 (25.3 %), 52 (21.8 %), 16 (21.8 %), 68 (10.3 %), 51 (10.34 %) and 18 (9.2 %). The prevalence of multi-type HR-HPV genotypes was 0.81 %, of which the most common co-infection genotypes were 52 and 58 (20.0 %), 16 and 56 (10.0 %), and 16 and 39 (10.0 %). The percentages of one-, two-, three-, and four-genotypes of HPV among positive cases were 77.0 %, 16.1 %, 4.6 % and 2.3 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings explore a low prevalence of HR-HPV infection in Vietnamese women, of which genotypes 52 and 58 are more popular than 16 and 18. Continuously updated data on the genotype distribution of HPV are helpful for vaccine development and planning preventive activities to prevent HPV-related cancers.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Investigating Cancer Inequalities in Urbanizing Texas with Plausible Reasoning.",
    "AbstractText": "This article contributes to geographical methodology by presenting an epistemology of plausible reasoning (PR) as a complement to realist and reflexive frameworks for science. I introduce PR's theory of evidence, after Harold Jeffreys and George Pólya, and then extrapolate principles for nonexperimental study designs. This article leverages these principles to structure an investigation into the causes of a racial disparity in the colorectal cancer (CRC) burden in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan areas. Centered on a series of empirical questions pertaining to racial ghettoization, contemporary urbanization, and cancer inequalities, the study uncovers important geographic and social changes in the CRC burden in the study areas between 1999 and 2019. These include the emergence of a substantial class-related inequality in CRC incidence, the rise of aggregate racial disparities in CRC incidence outside of historically ghettoized areas, and an overall intensification of spatial CRC inequality. Drawing on fundamental cause theory and critical urban studies, I propose that these changes are a product of the uneven spread of new preventive technologies (screening colonoscopy) amid extensive and polarizing urbanization processes that are reshaping these regions. The study highlights the value of incorporating concern for dynamic macrostructures and political economy into analyses of spatial health data, and illustrates how PR can contribute to such work.",

    "AbstractText": "RNA modifications play crucial roles in shaping RNA structure, function, and metabolism. Their dysregulation has been associated with many diseases, including cancer, developmental disorders, cardiovascular diseases, as well as neurological and immune-related conditions. A particular type of RNA modification, 2'-O-methylation (Nm) stands out due to its widespread occurrence on all four types of nucleotides (A, U, G, C) and in most RNA categories, e.g., mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, and viral RNA. Nm is the addition of a methyl group to the 2' hydroxyl of the ribose moiety of a nucleoside. Given its great biological significance and reported association with many diseases, we first reviewed the occurrences and functional implications of Nm in various RNA species. We then summarized the reported Nm detection methods, ranging from biochemical techniques in the 70's and 80's to recent methods based on Illumina RNA sequencing, artificial intelligence (AI) models for computational prediction, and the latest nanopore sequencing methods currently under active development. Moreover, we discussed the applications of Nm in the realm of RNA medicine, highlighting its therapeutic potential. At last, we present perspectives on potential research directions, aiming to offer insights for future investigations on Nm modification.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To assist individuals, particularly cancer patients or those with complex comorbidities, in quickly identifying potentially contraindicated medications when taking multiple drugs simultaneously. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we introduce the Medication Extraction and Drug Interaction Chatbot (MEDIC), an artificial intelligence system that integrates optical character recognition and Chat generative pretrained transformer through the Langchain framework. Medication Extraction and Drug Interaction Chatbot starts by receiving 2 drug bag images from the patient. It uses optical character recognition and text similarity techniques to extract drug names from the images. The extracted drug names are then processed through Chat generative pretrained transformer and Langchain to provide the user with information about drug contraindications. The MEDIC responds to the user with clear and concise sentences to ensure the information is easily understandable. This research was conducted from July 1, 2022 to April 30, 2024. RESULTS: This streamlined process enhances the accuracy of drug-drug interaction detection, providing a crucial tool for health care professionals and patients to improve medication safety. The proposed system was validated through rigorous evaluation using real-world data, reporting high accuracy in drug-drug interaction identification and highlighting its potential to benefit medication management practices considerably. CONCLUSION: By implementing MEDIC, contraindicated medications can be identified using only medication packaging, and users can be alerted to potential drug adverse effects, thereby contributing to advancements in patient care in clinical settings.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive and often debilitating cancer for adults across the treatment trajectory. Patients experience frequent hospitalization, sedentariness, and negative sequelae including physical dysfunction and symptoms, which increase their risk for adverse events and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To test the preliminary efficacy of a tailored physical activity (PA) program. METHODS: This is a 2-group randomized controlled trial to explore the preliminary effects of a home-based tailored PA program versus attention control. The intervention includes PA across all physical domains important for independence. Assessments included physical function (6-Minute Walk Distance, primary), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and patient-reported symptoms (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-six adults with AML were randomized into intervention (n = 22) and control (n = 24). Participants had a mean age of 58 years. No adverse events were reported. We observed a 22% attrition and 83% adherence to the intervention. Clinically significant increases in 6-Minute Walk Distance (mean, 49.78 ± 98.9 vs 3.7 ± 155.1 m) and mean scores for cognition (3.2 [9.9] vs -0.7 [9.7]), depression (-5.1 [12.9] vs -1.8 [7.7]), and self-efficacy (3.7 [8.0] vs 1.4 [7.2]) from baseline to 12 weeks were found in the intervention group versus control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support safety, feasibility, and further testing of this intervention in a larger trial powered to evaluate efficacy of this tailored PA intervention to support adult AML survivors during treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This tailored intervention has the potential to support patients with AML and manage common sequelae across the treatment trajectory.",

    "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancers develop from pre-malignant polyps that can be removed during colonoscopy. Detection, assessment, and removal of polyps has a major role in bowel cancer prevention and is an important part of bowel cancer screening programmes. Trainee colonoscopists must acquire skills to recognise and classify colorectal polyps. Accurate classification is based on morphology, surface pit and capillary patterns. It is difficult to teach assessment skills because static polyp images are often of poor quality and cannot show all areas of interest. Based on anonymised, endoscopic reference images, 3D polyp models were created in ZBrush, demonstrating a variety of morphological forms. The models had detailed pit patterns to show the capillary structure, a key predictor of pathology. The models were subsequently uploaded to the online 3D repository and model viewer, Sketchfab, to create an interactive training resource for trainee colonoscopists. The digital models were evaluated by a panel of expert colonoscopists who scored them for realism and potential as aids for training. There was agreement that the digital polyp models would be useful for teaching. Polyp morphology was rated as realistic however representation of pit patterns received a mixed response, highlighting areas for further development.",

    "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers in women. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 10%-15% of breast cancer diagnoses and is an aggressive molecular breast cancer subtype associated with important challenges in its diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication. This poses an urgent need for developing more effective and personalized imaging biomarkers for TNBC. Towards this direction, artificial intelligence (AI) for radiologic imaging holds a prominent role, leveraging unique advantages of radiologic breast images, being used routinely for TNBC diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning, and offering high-resolution whole-tumour visualization, combined with the immense potential of AI to elucidate anatomical and functional properties of tumours that may not be easily perceived by the human eye. In this review, we synthesize the current state-of-the-art radiologic imaging applications of AI in assisting TNBC diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of radiomic and deep learning-based AI developments and their impact on advancing TNBC management over the last decade (2013-2024). For completeness of the review, we start with a brief introduction of AI, radiomics, and deep learning. Next, we focus on clinically relevant AI-based diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic models for radiologic breast images evaluated in TNBC. We conclude with opportunities and future directions for AI towards advancing diagnosis, treatment response predictions, and prognostic evaluations for TNBC.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Influence of the Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors on the Hemostatic Potential of Blood Plasma.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized classical treatment approaches of various cancer entities, but are also associated with a number of side effects. One of these may be life-threatening clotting disorders with the risk of thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications, the mechanisms of which are still poorly understood. In the present study, we analyzed the direct effects of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab on platelet aggregation as well as plasma coagulation followed by fibrinolysis in an ex vivo model. METHODS: Microplate spectrometry was used to analyze aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis in platelet-free (PFP) and platelet-rich (PRP) healthy donor plasma samples treated with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, and appropriate isotype controls. Aggregation was induced by TRAP-6. Clotting of PFP and PRP followed by lysis was initiated with a tissue factor in a mixture of phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine and the addition of t-PA. Among other parameters, the area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the effect of ICIs on aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. RESULTS: Upon direct contact with platelets, pembrolizumab stimulated platelet aggregation in PRP, while nivolumab and ipilimumab promoted disaggregation with corresponding changes in the AUC. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, both PD-1 receptor inhibitors, had no effect on the plasma coagulation cascade. Ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 receptor inhibitor, significantly increased the rate of PRP clotting. When clotting was followed by lysis, all ICIs were found to prolong the growth of the PRP-derived fibrin clot and delay its elimination. This was manifested by an increase in AUC relative to control PRP. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes the potential impact of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab on hemostasis. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are able to reduce aggregation and increase the procoagulant properties of platelets, which can cause side effects associated with hemostatic imbalance leading to thrombosis or bleeding. The observed ICI-specific effects may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms by which ICI affects platelets and suggest how, in a clinical setting, to reduce coagulation disorders during ICI treatment in the future.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Cancer survivors have an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). We introduce CAD polygenic risk scores (PRS) and examine associations with cancer status on CAD outcomes. METHODS: From the UK Biobank, we identified cancer survivors and CAD outcomes among 464,193 CAD-free participants using linked cancer registries, hospitalizations, and death records. CAD-PRS was categorized as low (lowest tertile), intermediate (tertile 2), and high (highest tertile). Adjusted Cox models assessed the joint and interaction effects of cancer status and CAD-PRS on CAD outcomes. RESULTS: Over the follow-up (median 11.7 years), 36,332 participants developed CAD. Compared to low CAD-PRS, the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CAD was 1.35 (1.31-1.38) for intermediate and 1.86 (1.81-1.91) for high CAD-PRS. The HR (95% CI) for CAD in cancer survivors was 1.16 (1.13-1.19) compared to those without cancer. In the joint effect analysis, compared to participants with low CAD-PRS and no cancer, the HRs (95% CIs) for CAD were 1.37 (1.32-1.41) and 1.90 (1.84-1.96) for intermediate and high CAD-PRS without cancer, respectively. For those with cancer, the HRs (95% CIs) were 1.26 (1.19-1.33), 1.59 (1.51-1.67), and 2.13 (2.03-2.23) for low, intermediate, and high CAD-PRS, respectively. A significant multiplicative interaction (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.98) was observed between CAD-PRS and cancer status on CAD. Additionally, a significant additive interaction between cancer and high CAD-PRS was found for fatal CAD. CONCLUSION: Cancer was associated with a higher risk of CAD and may further increase the risk of CAD related to genetic factors.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately one-fourth of all cancer cases and one-third of all tumor-related deaths worldwide. For the most frequent gastrointestinal tumor entities including colorectal, gastric, esophageal, and liver cancer, the incidence is expected to increase by more than 50% until 2040. While most gastrointestinal cancers are diagnosed beyond the age of fertility and predominantly in men, the increasing incidence of gastrointestinal malignancies in patients below the age of fifty suggests a growing importance in women of childbearing age. While localized cancers in pregnant women can either be monitored or treated surgically, more advanced stages might require radio- or chemotherapy to control tumor growth until delivery. Under these circumstances, critical decisions have to be made to preserve maternal health on the one side and minimize harm to the infant on the other side. SUMMARY: Here we summarize data from case reports, meta-analyses, and registries of women undergoing radio- or chemotherapy during pregnancy and provide guidance for therapeutic decision-making in pregnant women suffering from gastrointestinal cancers. KEY MESSAGE: After the first trimester, most chemotherapeutic regimens can be safely administered to pregnant patients with gastrointestinal cancers.

Genomic research data and genetic testing results are being shared and connected in ways never imagined. Genomic data sharing is critical for advancing precision health and increasing diversity in global genome databases. However, these advancements often come with undesirable consequences, which call for additional privacy safeguards and research practices to protect hereditary cancer patients and their families because relatives who may have genomic information in common with the patient causing privacy risks to ripple throughout a kinship network. We propose to address this gap using an interdisciplinary approach integrating bioethical principles (autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, respect for persons, and equity) with data science techniques to mitigate privacy risk challenges.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of pre-treatment hematological parameters in the prediction of clinical and radiological responses of locally advanced vulvar cancer to definitive chemoradiation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients treated at the King Hussein Cancer Center receiving definitive chemoradiation for pathologically confirmed locally advanced vulvar carcinoma. Response of the primary disease to treatment was classified as complete response (CR) if there was no clinically- or radiologically-confirmed residual disease at 12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Univariate analyses on complete response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were performed using clinical factors and pre-treatment hematological parameters. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were included, with a median age of 57.5 years and a median follow-up of 21 months. Of these, 24 patients (80%) achieved CR. Disease progression occurred in 11 patients (36.7%) during the follow-up period, and 9 (30%) died. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that only the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p = 0.007) and basophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (BLR) (p = 0.05) were predictive of OS. Conversely, PFS was significantly associated with white blood cell count (p = 0.042) and BLR (p = 0.004). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that NLR and BLR had significant predictive power for survival at the following cutoffs: 3.4 and 0.035, respectively. When categorized by ROC values, BLR was significantly associated with response to treatment (p = 0.026). Moreover, both NLR and BLR were significantly associated with OS and PFS. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment NLR and BLR may be useful predictive markers for clinical and radiological response, as well as for oncological outcomes in locally advanced vulvar cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation.",

Here we provide a narrative review of the recent use of large language models (LLMs) to support cancer care, prevention, and research. METHODS: We performed a search of the Scopus database for studies on the application of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and generative-pretrained transformer (GPT) LLMs in cancer care published between the start of 2021 and the end of 2023. We present salient and impactful papers related to each of these themes. RESULTS: Studies identified focused on aspects of clinical decision support (CDS), cancer education, and support for research activities. The use of LLMs for CDS primarily focused on aspects of treatment and screening planning, treatment response, and the management of adverse events. Studies using LLMs for cancer education typically focused on question-answering, assessing cancer myths and misconceptions, and text summarization and simplification. Finally, studies using LLMs to support research activities focused on scientific writing and idea generation, cohort identification and extraction, clinical data processing, and NLP-centric tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The application of LLMs in cancer care has shown promise across a variety of diverse use cases. Future research should utilize quantitative metrics, qualitative insights, and user insights in the development and evaluation of LLM-based cancer care tools.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Currently, a wide variety of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are available, each designed for specific applications in fields such as science, medicine, and industry. Advances in production technology have led to the development of more sensitive and efficient photodiodes, which are critical for applications requiring precision, such as medical imaging. METHODS: A research group has been working on designing a highly sensitive photodiode to enhance the capabilities of next-generation of hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. This involves integrating micropixel avalanche photodiodes (MAPDs) to improve image resolution. The chosen design features deep-immersion MAPDs with a pixel size of 12 microns and a density of 1000 pixels per mm 2, allowing for high-detail photon detection. The 4x4 mm 2 active area is optimized to balance sensitivity and size for high-resolution medical imaging. To produce these photodiodes, the group has outlined a production plan involving 300 mm silicon wafers grown using multiple techniques to enhance material properties. The Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems (MIMOS), renowned for its expertise in optical microelectronics, was selected as the production center. With MIMOS' state-of-the-art facilities, the project aims to meet stringent medical diagnostics standards. RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrated that the MAPD-3NM (MAPD design with 12 microns pixel size) photodiode achieved an amplification factor 1.8 times greater than the MAPD-3NK (MAPD design with 10 microns pixel size) under optimal conditions. The both samples size was 4x4 square mm. Its overvoltage range increased by 100%, reaching 4 V, enhancing photon detection and amplification. The MAPD-3NM also showed a significant reduction in dark current, about 3.5 times lower than the MAPD-3NK, improving performance in low-light environments. Additionally, the MAPD-3NM had a capacitance of 200 pF compared to 176 pF for the MAPD-3NK, contributing to its superior performance. These improvements make the MAPD-3NM more efficient and sensitive for scientific and medical applications. CONCLUSIONS: This project represents a major advancement in photodetector technology for medical diagnostics, aiming to develop more accurate and efficient PET-MRI scanners that enhance patient outcomes with improved imaging capabilities.",

This report presents a clinical case of OBC with intestinal obstruction as the initial symptom. A 67-year-old female with no underlying conditions presented to Zhuzhou Hospital Affiliated to Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University with intestinal obstruction. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen showed thickening of the lower rectum and ascending colon, suggestive of a neoplastic lesion. Chest CT showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla. Colonoscopy revealed only mucosal congestion, roughness, and thickening. Suspecting an intestinal tumor, laparoscopic radical resection of the rectal stenosis was performed. Postoperative pathology indicated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Immunohistochemistry showed positive expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), and cytokeratin 7 (CK7), suggesting breast cancer metastasis. Breast MRI revealed multiple proliferative nodules in both breasts (breast imaging reporting and data system, BI-RADS 2). Biopsies of the right lower-inner breast, bilateral axillary, and supraclavicular lymph nodes were performed. No carcinoma was found in the right breast tissues; however, small foci of carcinoma was detected in the right axillary lymph nodes, and poorly differentiated carcinoma of suspected breast origin was found in the bilateral supraclavicular and left axillary lymph nodes. The final diagnosis was OBC with lymph node and rectal metastasis. The patient died 16 months postoperatively. OBC often lacks identifiable primary breast lesions, and gastrointestinal metastases are particularly rare. Clinical manifestations are frequently masked by symptoms of metastatic lesions, making diagnosis challenging. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion. Due to rapid disease progression and multiorgan involvement, prognosis is extremely poor. Early identification of the primary lesion in OBC is crucial for improving outcomes.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Correlation between SWE parameters and histopathological features and immunohistochemical biomarkers in invasive breast cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a novel quantitative elastography technique that can assess the hardness of different tissues. This study introduces a novel shear wave parameter-frequency of mass characteristic (fmass)-and investigates its correlation, along with other shear wave parameters, with the histopathological features and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers of invasive breast cancer (IBC). The study aims to explore whether SWE can provide useful information for IBC treatment and prognosis. METHODS: With the pathological results as the gold standard, 258 malignant breast lesions were collected, and all patients underwent conventional ultrasound and SWE examinations. The SWE parameters [maximum elastic value (Emax), minimum elastic value (Emin), mean elastic value (Emean), standard deviation of elastic value of the whole lesion (Esd)] and fmass] in the transverse and longitudinal orthogonal sections were measured, and their correlations with the prognostic factors of IBC [including tumor diameters, axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis, lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI), calcification, histological type, histological grade, and IHC biomarkers (ER, PR, HER-2, Ki-67), and molecular subtypes] were analyzed. The correlations between the SWE parameters of the transverse and longitudinal sections of the tumors with different prognostic factors and the above indicators were analyzed. At the same time, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the efficacy of fmass in predicting ER and PR expression. RESULTS: Emean, Emax, Esd, and fmass were correlated with tumor diameters; Emean, Emax and Esd were correlated with histological types and histological grades. Emax and Esd were correlated with ALN metastasis, LVI and pathological types. In the IHC biomarker-labeled masses, fmass was correlated with ER and PR (both P<0.05), and Emean, Emax, and Esd were correlated with HER-2 and Ki-67 (all P<0.05). Emean, Emax, and fmass were all correlated with breast cancer subtypes (all P<0.05), and Emean and Emax were higher in Luminal B [HER-2(+)] breast cancer, while fmass was lower in HER-2(+) and triple-negative breast cancer. Among the statistically significant prognostic factors, the P values of the transverse sections of the masses were all less than or equal to those of the longitudinal sections. The AUC of fmass in the transverse sections of the masses for predicting ER and PR expression were 0.73 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.80) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), respectively, with the optimal cut-off values being 76.50 and 60.66, the sensitivities being 72.45% and 81.98%, the specificities being 66.13% and 45.35%, and the accuracies being 70.93% and 69.77%, respectively. The AUC of fmass in the longitudinal sections of the masses for predicting ER and PR expression were 0.74 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.81) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.72), respectively, with the optimal cut-off values being 131.8 and 137.5, the sensitivities being 69.90% and 66.28%, the specificities being 72.58% and 60.47%, and the accuracies being 70.54% and 64.34%, respectively. The fmass in the transverse sections of the masses was more statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The poor prognosis factors of IBC are related to high Emean, Emin, Emax, Esd, and low fmass. The fmass can predict the expression of ER and PR, and the transverse cut data are more meaningful. SWE is helpful for predicting the invasiveness of IBC.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The art of war: using genetic insights to understand and harness radiation sensitivity in hematologic malignancies.",
    "AbstractText": "It is well established that hematologic malignancies are often considerably radiosensitive, which enables usage of far lower doses of therapeutic radiotherapy. This review summarizes the currently known genomic landscape of hematologic malignancies, particularly as it relates to radiosensitivity and the field of radiation oncology. By tracing the historical development of the modern understanding of radiosensitivity, we focus on the discovery and implications of pivotal mutated genes in hematologic malignancies such as TP53, ATM, and other genes critical to DNA repair pathways. These genetic insights have contributed significantly to the advancement of personalized medicine, aiming to enhance treatment precision and outcomes, and there is an opportunity to extend these insights to personalized radiotherapy. We explore the transition from early discoveries to the current efforts in integrating comprehensive genomic data into clinical practice. Specific examples from Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and plasma cell neoplasms illustrate how genetic mutations could influence radiosensitivity and impact subsequent radiotherapeutic response. Despite the advancements, challenges remain in translating these genetic insights into routine clinical practice, particularly due to the heterogeneity of alterations and the complex interactions within cancer signaling pathways. We emphasize the potential of radiogenomics to address these challenges by identifying genetic markers that predict radiotherapy response and toxicity, thereby refining treatment strategies. The need for robust decision support systems, standardized protocols, and ongoing education for healthcare providers is critical to the successful integration of genomic data into radiation therapy. As research continues to validate genetic markers and explore novel therapeutic combinations, the promise of personalized radiotherapy becomes increasingly attainable, offering the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Analyzing 10-year time trends for Hysterectomy and Oophorectomy: Focus on Endometrial sampling and risk factors for Endometrial Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Hysterectomy is a versatile and commonly employed treatment option for various benign and malignant gynecological conditions. Our study aims to take a comprehensive perspective on hysterectomy over the years using accumulated data and provide clinicians with an accurate insight into the hysterectomy operation. MATERIAL-METHOD: This retrospective observational study was conducted on women who underwent hysterectomy at our clinic between 2012 and 2021. Comprehensive medical histories of all patients were thoroughly reviewed as the primary data. Surgical procedures were categorized and compared by year. Operation indications, preoperative endometrial sampling, and the pathology results of the final hysterectomy specimens were also examined. Risk factors were evaluated in confirmed cases of endometrial cancer and atypic endometrial hyperplasia based on pathology results. The analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 20 statistical analysis software. RESULTS: In our study, 752 patients(mean age: 52±8.2) underwent various hysterectomy procedures, with total abdominal hysterectomy being the most frequent(73.3%). The primary indication was uterine leiomyomas-adenomyomas(33.5%). Endometrial sampling was performed in 57.2% of patients, showing no significant difference in reliability(p=0.143) and endometrial cancer diagnosis(p=0.334). Among 38 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, approximately 28.9%(11 patients) did not undergo preoperative endometrial sampling. Further examination revealed that these patients were obese, 63.6% presented with spotting-like bleeding, and most were in the postmenopausal period. Risk factors for these patients and those with atypical hyperplasia indicated statistically significant positive family history(p=0.037) and estrogen therapy history(p=0.028). Out of 536 oophorectomies, 236 were performed in women under 50. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the need to implement the current literature and promote minimally invasive approaches. Widespread adoption of non-hysterectomy options is essential for rate reduction. Physicians must integrate current literature, refine skills in minimally invasive methods, and advance surgical techniques to achieve an idealized approach for premalignant lesions and endometrial cancer. Presenting clinic data to personalize algorithms and treatments will strengthen the literature, enhancing the field and increasing the applicability of knowledge for personalized implementation of ideal algorithms and treatments.",

Knowing their comparative usefulness may help in devising an appropriate strategy for early detection of this gynecological cancer in resource-constrained setting. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA assay, HPV DNA test and cytology in detection of high grade cervical lesions and invasive cervical carcinoma at a tertiary care center in India. METHODS: A total of 106 women were recruited in this hospital based study and underwent molecular tests (HPV DNA test and mRNA assay), cytological test and colposcopic-guided biopsy. Histopathological diagnosis was considered as the gold standard. RESULTS: We observed that 56 out of 106 participants had abnormal results in the terms of positive HPV DNA or E6/E7 mRNA with or without abnormal cytology or had histopathologically confirmed pre-malignant/malignant lesion. 47.2% (50/106) and 32% (34/106) women were positive for HPV DNA and E6/E7 mRNA respectively. 33% (35/106) women had abnormal cytology and 29.2% (31/106) had histologically confirmed CIN II and higher lesions. Sensitivity and specificity of cytology and HPV DNA for CIN lesions were calculated as 92%, 90.4% versus 88% & 68% respectively. mRNA assay was found to be more sensitive (96%) and specific (93.3%) than other tests in detecting CIN II + lesions. CONCLUSION: E6/E7 mRNA assay seems superior to HPV DNA test and cytology in detection of high grade cervical lesions and invasive carcinoma. It may be used as an alternative or adjunct to HPV DNA test or cytology for the purpose of cervical cancer screening and also be helpful in reducing the load for colposcopy.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Identifying ribonucleotide reductase subunit genes as potential lung adenocarcinomas biomarkers using integrated bioinformatics analysis.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunit genes (RRM1, RRM2 and RRM2B) expression is reported to be involved in the occurrence of various human malignancies. However, the prognostic value of RR subunit genes expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the expression profiles, prognostic values, and immune infiltrating associations of RR subunit genes in LUAD to explore whether RR subunit gene expression has value in the prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHODOLOGY: We used multiple search engines to access multiple online bioinformatics databases, including Oncomine, TIMER, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, PrognoScan, the Human Protein Atlas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, UCSC Xena, cBioProtal, TCGA, GEO, DAVID, and STRING databases. RESULTS: The study found that RRM1 and RRM2 might be an attractive target for treating LUAD, while RRM2B were down-expressed in LUAD (P < 0.05). The study also found that high RRM1 or RRM2 expression, or low RRM2B expression suggested poor prognosis of LUAD patients in both TCGA and GEO databases (P < 0.05). Additionally, our results indicated that RR subunit genes expressions have different characteristics with immune infiltrating, RRM2B had a slight but significant positive correlation with almost every infiltrating immune cells except CD4+ T cells (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, by co-expression gene network analysis of RR subunit genes, we found that five new hub genes (PLK1, AURKA, CDCA8, TTK and CDC45) were significantly positively correlated with RRM1 and RRM2 expression whereas were negatively correlated with RRM2B expression, and these five hub genes were identified to be related with a poor prognosis in LUAD patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate that RR subunit genes may be a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for LUAD patients.",

The condition is characterised by unfavorable prognosis when compared to that of females. The aim of the present work is to describe the anatomopathologic characteristics of males breast cancer at the level of the pathology department of the Hospital-University Center of Sidi Bel Abbes (ALGERIA). METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study on male breast cancers diagnosed in our pathology department between January 2010 and December 2020 was undertaken, the variables assessed were epidemiological, macroscopic, microscopic and immunohistochemical data. RESULTS: A total of 25 breast male cancer were identified in this study, the mean age at the diagnosis time was 58.8± 3.5 years, and the age was ranging from 37 to 83. The mean tumor size was 3.58 ± 1.5 cm, with sizeranging from 1.8 to 9 cm. About 18 of patients had tumors located in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ). Histopathological examination revealed the predominance of invasive carcinoma of no special type in 22 patients, followed by lobular carcinoma in 2 patients. 18 patients presented with nodal involvement and 23 of patients had hormonal receptors expression, including oestrogen receptor (RO), and progesterone receptor (RP). Additionnaly, just one patient had positive overexpression of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). CONCLUSION: Breast cancer in males in Algeria appears to be relatively rare and presents at an older age compared to females. Three out of four patients presented tumors in the UOQ and most were invasive carcinoma no special type. In the majority of male BC cases hormonal receptors and nodal involvement were present, while HER2 receptors were absent.",

AIM: The purpose of our study was to compare the clinical and oncological outcomes of patients with proximal and distal colon cancer, who underwent emergent surgery for obstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2012 to June 2022, patients with colon cancer presenting with obstruction and undergoing emergent surgery were analysed. The 2 groups were defined as proximal and distal according to the tumour location with respect to the splenic flexure. Postoperative early and long-term clinical and oncological outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: Of the 118 patients included in the study, there were 46 patients (38.9%) in the proximal group and 72 patients (61.1%) in the distal group. Single-session surgery including resection and anastomosis was performed on 31 (67.4%) and 29 (40.3%) patients in the proximal and distal groups, respectively (p = 0.007). The global mortality rate was 11%, and there was no difference between the groups. Five-year survival was similar in the proximal and distal groups, being 80.4% and 68.1%, respectively. In the analysis of patients who did not develop early mortality and underwent R0 resection, 3-year disease-free survival was 89.5% in the proximal group and 81.5% in the distal group; the difference was not significant (p = 0.165). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high in emergent surgeries for obstructed proximal and distal colon cancers.

    "AbstractText": "SIGNIFICANCE: Emerging evidence that aggressive breast tumors rely on various substrates including lipids and glucose to proliferate and recur necessitates the development of tools to track multiple metabolic and vascular endpoints concurrently in vivo. AIM: Our quantitative spectroscopy technique provides time-matched measurements of the three major axes of breast cancer metabolism as well as tissue vascular properties in vivo. APPROACH: We leverage exogenous fluorophores to quantify oxidative phosphorylation, glucose uptake, and fatty acid oxidation and endogenous contrast for measurements of hemoglobin and oxygen saturation. An inverse Monte Carlo algorithm corrects for aberrations resulting from tissue optical properties, allowing the unmixing of spectrally overlapping fluorophores. RESULTS: Implementation of our inverse Monte Carlo resulted in a linear relationship of fluorophore intensity with concentration (R2>0.95) in phantom validation studies. We next sequenced fluorophore delivery to faithfully recapitulate independent measurement of each fluorophore. The ratio of Bodipy FL C16/2-NBDG administered to a single animal is not different from that in paired animals receiving individual fluorophores (p=n.s.). Clustering of five variables was effective in distinguishing tumor from mammary tissue (sensitivity=0.92, specificity=0.67, accuracy=0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Our system is capable of measuring major axes of metabolism and associated vascular endpoints, allowing for future study of tumor metabolic flexibility.",

We aim to better understand real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of ALK fusion-positive (ALK+) patients with advanced-stage NSCLC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective population-based chart review of ALK+ patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Patients diagnosed from January 2014 to May 2023 were identified through the BC Cancer Genetics Laboratory database, and data were collected up to December 2023. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV ALK+ lung NSCLC were identified. Median age was 60 (range: 24-91) years, 151 (68.9%) had never smoked, and 95 (43.9%) were Asian. The median overall survival was 49.4 months with median follow-up time of 55.4 months. Majority of the cohort (n = 198, 91.7%) received palliative systemic therapy, all of which included at least one ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The most common first-line regimen was alectinib (n = 97, 49.0%) followed by crizotinib (n = 84, 42.4%); only four and one patient received lorlatinib and brigatinib first line, respectively. Alectinib was frequently prescribed overall, with 80.3% of patients receiving it in any treatment line. Time to treatment discontinuation was significantly longer (p < 0.0001) on first-line alectinib at 22.9 months as compared with 10.9 months for crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALK+ advanced NSCLC in BC have durable responses to ALK TKIs. Despite approval of all ALK TKIs for first-line use since 2021, alectinib is largely the favored agent in BC. Further real-world investigations can refine treatment strategies and shape policies around ALK TKIs for patients with ALK+ NSCLC.",

Following its identification as a mannose-binding lectin, henceforth called A. bisporus mannose-binding protein (Abmb), the protein is hypothesized to stimulate the innate immune cells response. The present work was aimed to substantiate that hypothesis. Furthermore, this study complements Abmb exploration as a potential agent for anti-breast cancer, which its treatment is hampered with compromised immunity of patient receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: Abmb's effect on the phagocytic activity of the macrophage was measured with FACS. Nitric oxide (NO) production was checked using Griess test while expression of the cytokines in the RAW 264.7 cells was analysed at gene and protein level using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and FACS, respectively. Abmb's effect on the expression of surface markers of the human immune cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was checked with specific antibodies for targeted cluster differentiation (CD) and analysed using FACS. RESULTS: Abmb increased the phagocytic activity of the macrophage and NO production. Abmb increased the expression of cytokines i.e. tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10. With the PBMCs, Abmb activated dendritic and natural killer (NK) cells, but not the B- or T-cells.

This includes anticancer compounds which have biomass constraints including using traditional techniques of lichen bioprospecting. This current study reports the use of cutting-edge metabolomics and a computational approach to discover anticancer biomarkers from Indonesian lichens. METHODS: Seven lichen crude extracts were evaluated against cervical cell lines HeLa using a MTT assay and secondary metabolites were profiled and recorded via a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) protocol. A multivariate analysis orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was employed to determine anticancer biomarker of the lichens. A structure-based computational study against the HeLa cancer cell related protein targets (BCL-2 (4MAN), AKT-1 (4GV1), MCL-1 (5FDO), and BRAF (5VAM)) was used to determine the most potent biomarker. RESULTS: The MTT assessment indicated the seven lichens possessed strong, medium and weak cytotoxicity. Multivariate analysis showed an OPLS-DA score plot with distinct separation among the strong, medium and weak cytotoxic groups. The biplot OPLS-DA and GC-MS analysis proposed 13 compounds of Parmelia caroliniana and 12 compounds of Physcia cf. millegrana as anticancer biomarker candidates.

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Sorafenib is known as one of the oral anti-cancer drugs used in liver cancer. However, its lipophilic nature can lead to side effects, variable pharmacokinetics, and poor absorption. The use of novel drug delivery systems, such as niosomes, may help address these issues and improve the effectiveness of sorafenib. METHODS: Different niosomal formulations of sorafenib were prepared. The morphology, size analysis, and physical stability were investigated. The encapsulation efficiency percent of the selected formulations was measured using the dialysis method, and the release of sorafenib was checked for four hours using the Franz diffusion cell. The cytotoxicity and in vitro effect on the HepG2 cell line was investigated using the MTT assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mean volume diameter of Span 60/Tween 60/cholesterol (45/45/10 mole%) niosomal formulation was 6 µm with minimal size changes and good stability over six months of storage. The encapsulation efficiency percent of this formulation was 66.40±1.11, and 61.43±1.42 percent of the drug was released within 4 hours. In vitro release followed Higuchi kinetics. Cytotoxicity tests showed an IC50 of 7.5 µg/mL for the niosomal formulation, compared to 15.96 µg/mL for the sorafenib solution. CONCLUSION: Niosomes containing Span 60/ Tween 60/ cholesterol (45/45/10 mole%) are promising for loading and sustained release of sorafenib. The use of niosome as a carrier can enhance the effectiveness of sorafenib on the HepG2 cell line. This niosomal formulation of sorafenib shows potential for future studies.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Autophagy, governed by genes with dual roles in cell death and survival, plays a crucial role in cancer persistence. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), carboplatin (CP), and cyclophosphamide (CY) are used to treat various cancers. ATO impedes cell proliferation and triggers apoptosis in cancer cells. CP, a platinum-based drug, damages cancer cell DNA, while CY acts as an alkylating agent, disrupting cell proliferation. This study investigates the combined effects of ATO, CP, and CY on inducing apoptosis and modulating autophagy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, BT-20 and MDA-MB-231. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of ATO, CP, and CY, alone and in combination, were evaluated using the MTT assay on BT-20 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptosis and cell cycle progression were analyzed by annexin-V FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. Gene expression of autophagy-and apoptosis-related markers, including Beclin 1, LC3, caspase 3, and BCL2, was quantified using RT-PCR. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 with one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. RESULTS: The combination of ATO, CP, and CY significantly reduced cell viability and enhanced apoptosis, evidenced by increased caspase-3 activity and reduced BCL2 expression. Cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase was observed, alongside elevated autophagy markers Beclin 1 and LC3. CONCLUSION: The combination of ATO, CP, and CY induces synergistic effects in promoting apoptosis and autophagy in TNBC cell lines.

    "AbstractText": "Bladder cancer is treated by surgical removal of the tumor followed by injection of anticancer drugs or the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. However, there are insufficient effective drug options depending on the risk category of bladder cancer. One of the reasons for this is the limited number of suitable experimental models that reproduce the pathology of bladder cancer for each risk category. There has been increasing interest in the patient-derived xenograft model as an experimental model to reproduce the original nature of the tumor in a patient. However, there are unresolved problems regarding its practical use, such as the low success rate of engraftment, variation in the growth rate between experiments, and the lack of a reliable method to prepare a patient-derived xenograft model from cryopreserved tumor tissue. In this study, the effect of scaffold material on the preparation of a bladder cancer patient-derived xenograft model was investigated and it was found that gelatin/polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel offers advantages for engraftment of cryopreserved bladder cancer tissue. It was shown that the proliferation of cryopreserved bladder cancer cells was promoted with less necrosis and thrombi around the tissue when transplanted into immunodeficient animals with glycol-based hydrogel compared to transplantation with Matrigel or without any scaffold. This study proposes a new method to generate patient-derived xenograft models from cryopreserved bladder cancer tissue, which is expected to have improved proliferation activity after transplantation.",

Four BSc-qualified nurses who worked in the chosen hospitals collected the data using pretested questionnaire and an HPV test (OncoE6TM Cervical Test) specific to HPV16/18 in cervical swabs. Descriptive analysis was performed to determine the prevalence and a multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify the associated factors of HPV16/18 infection. Finally, statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of HPV infection was 14.2% (95% CI: 10.7% -18.1%). The mean age of the respondents was 36.7±9.1 years. Women with the age group of 55-65 years (AOR = 7.91, 95% CI: 1.95-32.09), early initiation of sexual intercourse (AOR = 5.36, 95% CI: 1.58-18.13), history of sexually transmitted infection (STI) (AOR = 3.52, 95% CI: 1.27-9.72), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status (AOR = 6.8, 95% CI: 1.99-23.54), and number of lifetime sexual partners (AOR = 4.37, 95% CI: 1.15-17.3) were important independent factors associated with the presence of oncogenic HPV infection. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: We found a relatively low prevalence of high-risk HPV infection. Age, early initiation of sexual intercourse at less than 18 years, STI of women, being HIV seropositive, and a number of sexual partners were important factors for high-risk HPV infection. Women aged > 46 years, women with early initiation of sex, a history of STI, being HIV positive, and a history of multiple sexual partners should be encouraged to be screened and vaccinated for HPV infection. Wider-ranging studies are also needed in HPV-infected women in association with the cervical lesion.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The induction of the inflammatory cascade results in the production of a number of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), and proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-, IL-, and IL-6. This study examined the cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory properties of a methanolic crude extract of Punica granatum L. peel (PPM) on monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PPM along with Quercetin as reference was used to assess the cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells and describe its effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines such as COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6 against cancer cell line by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentage of viable cells significantly decreased which correlates to non-toxicity whereas quercetin was found to be highly toxic, the IC50 could not be calculated because of drug precipitation. There was a significant decrease in the expressions of inflammatory cytokines upon pre-treatment of the cells with PPM prior to LPS stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that no cytotoxicity was observed after the treatment of THP-1 cells with PPM (25-400 µg/ml), but at higher concentration (400µg/ml), the cell viability decreased to 84% and attenuated the expression level of inflammatory cytokines. The inhibitory effect of the extract on pro-inflammatory factors production may provide a theoretical source on upcoming treatment of inflammation.",

METHODS: A sample size of 112 breast cancer patients was selected and all patients underwent surgical treatment. The three-year prognosis of the patients was observed. Patients with poor prognoses were included in the poor prognoses group and the patients with good prognosis were included in the good prognosis group. The levels of serum CEA, CA153, HE4, and related immune inflammatory indicators (including Mon, Lym, Neu, Plt, NLR, and SII) were analysed. The predictive value of serum CEA, CA153, HE4, and immune inflammatory indicators on the prognosis of breast cancer was analysed by Logistic regression and ROC curve method. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive efficiency. α=0.05 was used as the test standard. RESULTS: Compared with the good prognosis group, the CEA, CA153, HE4, Mon, Neu, Plt, and SII of the poor prognosis group were higher, all P<0.05. Logistic regression analysis showed that CEA, CA153, HE4, Neu, and Plt were effective indicators for predicting the poor prognosis of breast cancer. The AUC of CEA, CA153, HE4, Neu, and Plt in predicting the prognosis of breast cancer was 0.929, which was higher than the AUC of a single prediction. CONCLUSION: Serum CEA, CA153, HE4 combined with Neu and Plt had predictive value for the prognosis of breast cancer.",

METHODOLOGY: We collected active ingredients and targets of QED according to the database of Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and selected therapeutic targets on RA. \"drug-ingredient-target\" network was made for the intersecting genes. The STRING database was used for constructing a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) for the intersection genes, and R version 4.1.2 software was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. RESULTS: We found that there were 141 main active ingredients in QED, of which the main core active ingredients were: β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, baicalein, wogonin, kaempferol, etc., involving 166 RA genes. GO enrichment analysis results showed that QED involved 2229 biological processes, 78 cell components and 212 molecular functions. QED might interfere and treat RA through lipid and atherosclerosis, cancer pathways, PI3K-Akt, AGE-RAGE, IL-17, TNF, as well as HIF-1 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: QED may treat RA by regulating inflammation-related signaling pathways, angiogenesis signaling pathways, and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors.",

While sarcomas are not classically considered LS cancers, we investigated the MMR status and clinical features of sarcomas in LS patients to help inform optimal treatment strategies. METHODS: A prospectively maintained institutional clinical cancer genetics database was queried for LS patients (defined by pathogenic germline mutation in a MMR gene) with a documented diagnosis of sarcoma between 1998-2022. Tumor MMR status was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR proteins and secondarily by PCR assay if IHC was normal or intact. RESULTS: Among the 30 LS patients with sarcoma, germline mutations were most common in MSH2 (50%). The most common sarcoma subtypes were undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (40%) and leiomyosarcoma (27%). Median age at diagnosis was 49.2 years (interquartile range 40.4-62.4). 90% presented with localized disease, and 10% presented with synchronous metastatic disease. Among 10 patients with tissue available for biomarker determination, dMMR was confirmed in 4 (40%), while the remaining (60%) were pMMR. Three patients received immunotherapy. Two of these had confirmed dMMR tumor status: one demonstrated a sustained complete response on pembrolizumab monotherapy for 44 months; the other had a partial response on ipilimumab and nivolumab for 31 months but died from an unrelated cause. In the entire cohort of 30 patients at a median follow-up time of 68.2 months since sarcoma diagnosis (interquartile range 29.0-151.5 months), median overall survival and progression-free survival have not been reached. CONCLUSION: While rare, sarcoma can be encountered in patients with LS, particularly those with germline MSH2 mutation. LS-associated sarcomas occur significantly earlier, carry a favorable outcome, and demonstrate the potential for durable response with immunotherapy.",

    "ArticleTitle": "SAP30, a novel autophagy regulatory gene in neuroblastoma.",
    "AbstractText": "Neuroblastoma (NB), a devastating pediatric cancer originating from neural crest cells crucial for nervous system development, poses a significant therapeutic challenge. Despite chemotherapy being the primary treatment, approximately 70% of high-risk NB cases develop resistance. Autophagy is vital for neuronal development, balance, and differentiation of neural stem cells into mature neurons. However, the intricate mechanisms governing autophagy and the pivotal genes orchestrating its regulation in NB remain largely elusive. In this study, we first identified Sin3A Associated Protein 30 (SAP30) as a novel regulator of autophagy in NB. Silencing SAP30 inhibits autophagy and disrupts starvation-induced physiological autophagy in NB cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of SAP30 induces autophagy in NB cells under normal or starvation conditions. Mechanistically, SAP30 transcriptionally regulates STX17, a crucial protein involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion during autophagy. Reduction of SAP30 decreases STX17 expression, hindering its translocation to the autophagic membrane and inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. SAP30-mediated autophagy enhances cell growth and provides protection in NB cells treated with chemotherapy drugs. Notably, suppressing SAP30 in vivo increases LC3B accumulation, an autophagy marker, along with reduced proliferation markers, both in vivo and in PDX tumors. Therefore, SAP30 emerges as a potential target to enhance NB responsiveness to chemotherapy drugs.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Development and validation of a pathological model predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer based on RCB scoring.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer has become the most prevalent malignant tumor among women globally, posing a serious threat to women's life and health. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has emerged as one of the standard treatment approaches for breast cancer patients. However, due to varying responses to NAT among different patients, significant differences in treatment effectiveness occur, impacting the timely alteration of treatment strategies for patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included a total of 201 breast cancer patients who completed NAT, divided into a training group of 140 cases and a validation group of 61 cases. Based on clinical and pathological characteristics along with the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score, we utilized a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to construct a Pathomics Breast Cancer Signature (PBCS) prediction model. We thoroughly validated the PBCS and compared it to a Pathomics Signature (PS) prediction model. RESULTS: In our study, we used CellProfiler to extract nine pathological features highly correlated with patients' RCB scoring from HE-stained slides of breast cancer NAT. Employing the SVM algorithm, we developed a pathological prediction label, named PS. Subsequently, through univariate and multivariate analysis, we discovered a significant correlation between HER2 and the patients' RCB scores. Integrating HER2 into PS, we constructed a breast cancer pathological prediction model, named PBCS. PBCS exhibits good performance in predicting the effectiveness of postoperative therapy (RCB 0-I) in both the training sets (AUC = 0.86 [95% CI: 0.7988-0.9173]) and validation sets (AUC = 0.83 [95% CI: 0.7219-0.9382]). In the validation set, PBCS significantly outperforms the PS (AUC = 0.65 [95% CI: 0.5121-0.7886]). Calibration curves and clinical decision curves also strongly support PBCS's ability to effectively predict the efficacy of therapy (RCB 0-I). CONCLUSIONS: PBCS can assist clinical and pathological physicians in accurately predicting patients' post-treatment RCB grading before initiating NAT. This offers a new approach to forecast breast cancer patients' responsiveness to NAT, aiding in devising personalized treatment strategies for patients.",

We conducted a systematic two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify key human blood metabolites and potential biomarkers for breast cancer development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data were extracted from large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) public databases. Instrumental variables were selected from a cohort study of 453 metabolic profiles from 7,824 participants. Breast cancer incidence data were obtained from a large cohort study involving 138,389 cases and 240,341 controls. Causal associations between human blood metabolites and breast cancer incidence were assessed using inverse-variance weighting, and MR-Egger regression. RESULTS: Five human blood metabolites were identified as biomarkers for breast cancer: serine (OR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.18-4.27), 10-undecenoate (11:1n1) (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.00-1.90), X-12696 (OR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.14-4.08), X-14626 (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.15-2.46), and succinyl carnitine (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.06-2.34). The sensitivity analysis results indicate no pleiotropy between the metabolites and breast cancer risk, confirming the robustness of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study in metabolomics research identified five human blood metabolites - serine, 10-undecenoate (11:1n1), X-12696, X-14626, and succinylcarnitine - as potential biomarkers for assessing breast cancer risk. Among these metabolites, serine and X-12696 showed the strongest associations with the likelihood of developing breast cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is a hepatokine implicated in fat metabolism regulation. Its genetic inactivation has been associated with improved glucose homeostasis, while elevated plasma ANGPTL4 levels are observed in diabetic and obese individuals. However, the potential link between ANGPTL4 and diabetes- or obesity-related complications remains uncertain. This study aimed to explore whether plasma ANGPTL4 level could serve as a predictor of cancer mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in a community-based cohort. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A community-based cohort study was conducted, where fasting plasma ANGPTL4 concentrations were measured at baseline, and vital status was ascertained through linkage with the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. RESULTS: During a 10.46-year follow-up period, 29 (2.49%) of the 1163 participants died. Subjects within the highest tertile of plasma ANGPTL4 levels exhibited the lowest survival rate. In unadjusted models, plasma ANGPTL4 significantly predicted all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cardiovascular or cancer-related mortality. Upon adjustment for confounders including age, sex, smoking, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and renal function, each standard deviation increase in plasma ANGPTL4 was associated with HRs of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01-1.80, p < 0.05) for all-cause mortality, 1.41 (95% CI: 0.94-2.10, p = 0.094) for cancer mortality, and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.02-1.94, p < 0.05) for cardiovascular or cancer-related mortality. Additionally, plasma ANGPTL4 contributed more significantly to predicting cardiovascular or cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality compared to other predictors, such as sex, smoking, BMI, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, and eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma ANGPTL4 emerges as a promising biomarker capable of predicting 10-year mortality and enhancing risk prediction beyond established risk factors.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: There is scarce real-world evidence on patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We assessed the oncological outcome in groups by molecular classification. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy after hysterectomy at The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Norway, between January 2006 and December 2017. Patients were molecularly classified as pathogenic POLE mutated, mismatch repair deficient, p53 abnormal, or no specific molecular profile. Time-to-recurrence and cancer-specific survival were calculated. RESULTS: We identified 264 advanced-stage patients (stage III/IV) and 96 patients with recurrent disease. The molecular classification was prognostic for time-to-recurrence (p < .0001) and cancer-specific survival (p < .0001) in patients with advanced disease, but the outcome did not differ significantly by molecular groups in recurrent patients. In all molecular groups, patients with stage III disease had longer time-to-recurrence and cancer-specific survival compared to patients with stage IV disease. The worst outcome was observed in patients with p53 abnormal tumors with an HR of 1.57 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.30) for time-to-recurrence and HR of 1.78 (95% CI 1.19 to 2.65) for cancer-specific survival in stage III/IV disease and an HR of 1.45 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.52) for time-to-recurrence and HR of 1.60 (95% CI 0.99 to 2.68) for cancer-specific survival in patients with recurrent disease. The few patients with POLE mutated tumors had favorable outcomes despite the advanced/recurrent disease status. CONCLUSIONS: Oncological outcomes differ by molecular groups, in particular among patients with advanced disease. Patients with p53 abnormal tumors have the worst outcome, while patients with POLE mutated tumors have favorable outcomes even with recurrent disease. Implementation of the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy is expected to lead to substantial improvement of outcome, particularly in patients with mismatch repair deficient advanced/recurrent disease. There is still a high unmet need in advanced/recurrent patients with p53 abnormal and no specific molecular profile tumors.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer reported suboptimal adherence to oral anticancer agents, reducing the therapeutic benefit and increasing mortality risk. The Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation highlights patients' perceptions of illness and treatment influence adherence. However, how these perceptions influence adherence remains unknown among this population. This study aimed to explore whether illness perceptions influence adherence via their effect on medication perceptions. METHODS: A multi-center cross-sectional study design was conducted. Between July and August 2023, a questionnaire was administered to patients from four tertiary hospitals in Mainland China. Illness perceptions were assessed using the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire. Medication perceptions were measured in medication belief and self-efficacy using the Belief about Medicines Questionnaire and Self-efficacy for Appropriate Medication Use Scale, respectively. Adherence was evaluated using the Morisky 4-item Medication Adherence Scale. Mediation analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In total, 253 participants were recruited. Patients with worse negative illness perceptions reported higher concern, lower self-efficacy, and poorer adherence. Medication self-efficacy was positively associated with adherence, whereas the necessity and concern belief of taking oral anticancer agents were not. Illness perceptions, including the cognitive and emotional dimensions, had direct and indirect effects on adherence via its effects on medication self-efficacy. The indirect effect explained 26.63% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: The association between illness perceptions and adherence is partially mediated by medication self-efficacy. Strategies to foster positive illness perceptions may contribute to better medication self-efficacy and adherence. Attention should be equally focused on both the emotional and cognitive dimensions of illness perceptions.",

Brain tumors diagnosed in Finland during 1990-2016 were identified by the Finnish Cancer Registry. For each case, three age- and sex-matched controls were sampled from the Population Information System. The study population was linked to a CT dataset encompassing pediatric CTs performed in Finland during 1975-2011. We implemented a 5-year lag period and excluded participants with cancer predisposition syndromes or previous malignancies. We estimated brain doses using the NCICT program. Overall, 1067 brain tumors were diagnosed in children aged 0-15 years during 1990-2016, 58% of which were gliomas. Among eligible participants, nine cases (1%) and 10 controls (0.4%) had undergone at least one head/neck CT scan. The mean cumulative brain dose was 22 mGy for exposed participants. Participants who had undergone one or more head/neck CTs had a higher risk of developing brain tumors compared to unexposed individuals (Odds ratio [OR] = 2.84, 95% CI 1.12, 7.19). The excess OR (EOR) per 100 mGy of brain dose was 5.50 (95% CI 0.31, 10.95) for all brain tumors, and 1.06 (95% CI -6.55, 9.30) for gliomas. Our results suggest a positive association between head/neck CT imaging and the risk of childhood brain tumors. These findings contribute to the existing knowledge about the hazards of low dose ionizing radiation in pediatric populations. Further research with more precise dosimetry, including dose distribution within the brain, is needed.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Targeting of Lysosomes as a Therapeutic Target in Cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "Lysosomes are important intracellular organelles involved in degradation metabolism, maintenance of homeostasis, cell survival and programmed death regulation, and play an important role in immunity. Some studies have shown that lysosomes are closely linked to tumor development. Lysosomes in tumor cells increase in size and activity to adapt to rapid proliferation. Cancer cells provide strong support for their unrestricted growth and proliferation by precisely regulating the number, composition and functional activities of lysosomes and also create favorable conditions for malignant behaviors such as survival, migration, invasion, and metastatic spread of cancer cells. Lysosomes play a central role in tumor progression, and in recent years, lysosomes have become an important target for anticancer strategies aimed at interfering with their function or modulating related signaling pathways to inhibit tumors. Current anti-cancer strategies include the following five aspects: (1) targeting tumor cell energy metabolism and lysosomes to inhibit growth; (2) inhibiting lysosomal histone proteases to block degradation metabolism; (3) destabilizing lysosomal membranes to trigger tumor cell death; (4) modulating lysosomal calcium signaling to affect tumor cell function; and (5) interfering with the mTOR signaling pathway to inhibit tumor growth and proliferation. These lysosome-targeted anticancer strategies offer broad prospects and potential for the development of novel anticancer drugs and therapies and are expected to bring more effective and safer therapeutic options for cancer patients.",

For screening mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) combined with acquired digital 2D mammography or synthetic 2D mammography is widely used throughout the United States. As of this writing in July 2024, there are six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared AI-based CADe/x tools for DBT. These tools detect suspicious lesions on DBT and provide corresponding scores at the lesion and examination levels that reflect likelihood of malignancy. In this article, we review the evidence supporting the use of AI-based CADe/x for DBT. The published literature on this topic consists of multireader, multicase studies, retrospective analyses, and two \"real-world\" evaluations. These studies suggest that AI-based CADe/x could lead to improvements in sensitivity without compromising specificity and to improvements in efficiency. However, the overall published evidence is limited and includes only two small postimplementation clinical studies. Prospective studies and careful postimplementation clinical evaluation will be necessary to fully understand the impact of AI-based CADe/x on screening DBT outcomes.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2022 and December 2022, all patients with pathologically confirmed prostate cancer candidates for radical prostatectomy were included. Patients who had previous abdominal surgeries or were unfit for pneumoperitoneum were excluded. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were prospectively collected. RARP was performed through 5 ports (12 mm); 3 for the robotic arms, 1 for the camera, and 1 for the assistant surgeon. Repeated adjustments of the patient's position and port distribution along with the bedside unit's configuration, arrangement, and orientation were made until an optimal setup was achieved. The technical malfunctions were identified in each case and fixed in the subsequent ones. All patients were invited to the follow-up clinic for routine visits on the first and second weeks following surgery and then every month for three months. RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent the procedure without conversion to laparoscopy or open surgery and abided by the follow-up regimen. The first nine cases required frequent setup adjustments due to recurring alarms and arms-related conflicts. Thenceforth, the mean docking time, console time, urethro-vesical anastomosis time, and total operative time were enhanced in the last 21 cases without system alarms. No major intraoperative complications related to the robotic system utilization were reported. The postoperative course of all participants passed uneventfully. The median length of the hospital stay and catheterization time were 2 (1-2) and 7 (7-10) days, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Versius system offers a promising robotic platform with a flexible surgical setup. The proposed setup provides a guide for a smooth performance in RARP with minimal instruments' collision to eschew system failure. Being the first generation of this surgical robotic system, future efforts are still needed to improve its performance and minimize its drawbacks.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Nephrogenic adenoma of the urinary bladder. Clinical features, long-term follow-up and recurrence predictors.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical features of nephrogenic adenoma (NA) of the urinary bladder and assess the long-term recurrence rates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all diagnosed NA of the urinary bladder between 2000 and 2023 was done. All patients' demographics, symptoms, history of previous bladder surgeries, macroscopic and microscopic features of NA and coincidental pathology were reviewed. The long-term recurrence rate including malignant recurrence was assessed. Univariate and multivariate analysis of predictor of recurrence was performed. RESULTS: We identified 24 patients diagnosed with NA with a mean (SD, range) age of 56 (16, 15-73) years. Eighteen (75%) patients had previous history of bladder surgeries. Macroscopic appearance on cystoscopy looked polypoidal, flat velvety, papillary and nodular in eight, seven, five, and four patients, respectively. At a median (range) follow-up of 35 (18-145) months, 15 (63%) patients developed one recurrence including NA, non-specific cystitis and urothelial carcinoma (UC) in nine, three and three patients, respectively. Of them, five had a second recurrence, and one patient had a third recurrence. Patients with malignant recurrence had previous history of UC and two of them required radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. Previous TURBT was the only independent predictor for recurrence [OR (95% CI) = 28 (2-37), p = 0.01]. CONCLUSION: Nephrogenic adenoma is a benign disease that mimics malignant lesion clinically. It is associated with high recurrence rate. Previous resection of bladder lesion is the independent predictor of the recurrence.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Implementing VIRADS score for image-guided assessment of muscle invasiveness in bladder cancer pre-TURBT: An updated meta-analysis.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Bladder urothelial carcinoma is the most prevalent malignancy of the urinary system worldwide. Accurate staging of bladder cancer, particularly distinguishing between non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), is essential for determining appropriate treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the vesical imaging-reporting and data system (VI-RADS) scoring system using multiparametric MRI in differentiating NMIBC from MIBC. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to December 2023. Studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the VI-RADS scoring system using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish between NMIBC and MIBC were included. Data from eligible studies were extracted to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity, and heterogeneity was assessed using meta-regression and subgroup analyses by using STATA V17.0. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies, comprising 3,798 bladder cancer patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for predicting MIBC using a VI-RADS cutoff score of ≥ 3 was 89%, with moderate heterogeneity observed across studies. Subgroup analysis revealed variations in diagnostic performance based on geographic location (North America, Europe, and Asia), MRI technical parameters, and study design. Studies utilizing 3.0 Tesla MRI scanners and those involving multiple radiologists demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: The VI-RADS system demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing between NMIBC and MIBC, with a cutoff score of ≥ 3 yielding optimal sensitivity and specificity. Its integration into clinical practice has the potential to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve staging accuracy, and expedite treatment decisions. Future research should focus on standardizing MRI protocols and further validating these findings across diverse clinical settings to enhance the utility of VI-RADS in bladder cancer management.",

    "AbstractText": "Oral carcinoma cuniculatum (OCC) is an uncommon and distinctive variant of oral squamous cell carcinoma affecting the oral cavity. It commonly arises from the skin although it can originate from various mucosal surfaces including oral mucosa. OCC is locally aggressive and destroys the underlying bone. Published literature provides description on as few as thirty cases of OCC involving the mandible and not much information is available leading to misdiagnosis of this condition. Very few cases are reported to have recurrences and they rarely exhibit metastasis tendency. Due to availability of only limited data on OCC, ongoing research aims to enhance understanding, refine diagnostic criteria, and explore targeted treatment modalities for this rare form of oral cancer. With a tendency for locally aggressive behavior and a predilection for the mandibular region, management of OCC requires a multidisciplinary approach. This report depicts a case of oral carcinoma cuniculatum of mandible in a 63-year-old female with an overview of its clinical characteristics, radiological and histopathological features, and challenges in diagnosis and management. This rare case report highlights the aggressive nature of this pathology as it had a tendency for recurrence and regional metastasis.",

METHODS: The cross-sectional study included 4 groups (n = 12/group). Group I consisted of healthy individuals (controls), Group II individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) without oral cancer, Group III individuals had only oral cancer and Group IV individuals had oral cancer and T2D. Demographic characteristics and biochemical values were recorded. Salivary and serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured using a quantitative sandwich ELISA technique. RESULTS: Serum IGF-1 levels [Median (Inter-quartile range)] were highest among the control group [255 (135) ng/ml], followed by only T2D group [210 (147) ng/ml], oral cancer with T2D group [149 (45) ng/ml] and finally the oral cancer group [143 (81) ng/ml, p for trend = 0.004]. Salivary IGF-1 values were significantly higher in both the groups with T2D [T2D:0.42 (0.20) ng/ml; oral cancer with T2D: 0.40 (0.21) ng/ml] when compared to those with only oral cancer [0.27 (0.06) ng/ml] and controls: 0.17 (0.17) ng/ml], p for trend = 0.007].

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Atraumatic avascular necrosis (AVN) of the elbow is a rare diagnosis with little literature describing features of this pathology. The purpose of this study is to investigate atraumatic elbow AVN in adults, with a focus on the anatomic distribution of AVN within skeletally mature elbows. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on six patients who were identified via term searches of elbow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done at the authors' institution that also had appropriate diagnoses. Terms included \"necrosis\", \"AVN\", and \"avascular\". Demographic data were collected, including age of diagnosis, sex, associated comorbidities, use of steroids, use of chemotherapeutic agents, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and associated joint involvement. Clinical information regarding presentation and treatment course were also gathered. Both plain film and MRI were evaluated for identification of anatomic involvement of disease and staging. RESULTS: Six patients were included in the study: three men and three women with a mean age of 26.5 years (17-46) at time of diagnosis. All patients presented with elbow pain and one patient presented additionally with loss of full range of motion. Four of the six patients had a prior cancer diagnosis (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia x2, follicular lymphoma, acute myeloblastic leukemia) that led to chemotherapy exposure, and two of them had additional steroid therapy. Another two had autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematous and dermatomyositis) that required high dose steroid therapy. At time of initial imaging, the capitellum was involved in 8 of 9 elbows, the trochlea in 8 of 9 elbows, the radial head in 4 of 9 elbows, the proximal ulna in 2 of 9 elbows, and the olecranon in 1 of 9 elbows. Only one elbow had additional sites of the elbow affected at future follow-ups. One patient presented with AVN of the capitellum, trochlea, and ulnar neck, and two years later had signs of olecranon osteonecrosis on MRI. Two patients underwent operative treatment with resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study describes the anatomic incidence of AVN of the elbow. Most involved are the capitellum and trochlea, with involvement in the radial head, proximal ulna, and olecranon also being observed. This information can be used to help orthopedic surgeons in their diagnosis and clinical decision making for affected patients.",

    "AbstractText": "There remain several intractable challenges for chemotherapy in glioma treatment, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), and tumor heterogeneity caused by cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Here, we established a nano strategy to kill glioma cells and CSCs, combining carfilzomib and bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper. The synergistic drug combination disturbed cell protein metabolism at different stages and induced apoptosis and cuproptosis. The Y-shaped targeting ligand pHA-VAP-modified nanodiscs were designed to help the chemotherapeutic agents cross the BBB/BBTB and finally accumulate in tumor site. This all-stage targeting and all-stage treatment nanomedicine significantly prolonged the survival in glioma-bearing mice and might inspire the rational design of advanced drug delivery platforms.",

METHODS: Between July 2019 and March 2021, we tested 2216 breast cancer probands from Chinese communities for BRCA1/2 mutations and collected detailed information on the age, survival status, and malignancy history of first-degree relatives. The kin-cohort method was used to calculate the penetrance of breast cancer and other malignant tumors. RESULTS: Of the 2216 breast cancer probands, 109 (4.90%) carried BRCA1/2 P/LP variants, 49 in the BRCA1 gene and 60 in the BRCA2 gene. The penetrance of female breast cancer by 85 years of age was 22.50% and 18.20% in BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers, respectively. The penetrance of ovarian cancer by 85 years of age was 26.00% in BRCA1 P/LP variant carriers. The penetrance of other malignancies did not reach statistical significance owing to the small number of events. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that breast cancer penetrance among BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers was 22.50% and 18.20%, respectively, which suggests that prophylactic mastectomy may not be necessary for such Chinese individuals.

Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), the opposite of EMT, causes tumor metastasis. EMT drives primary tumor cells, whereas MET inhibits them. Importantly, the complex network of EMT includes cell-cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Transcription factors, post-translational regulation, cytokine-mediated signaling, and microRNAs control EMT. In this review, we discussed how molecular mechanisms, signaling networks, and epithelial/mesenchymal states affect cancer treatment resistance and the tumor microenvironment.

We conducted a retrospective study using data derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and clinicopathological data to construct a clinical predictive model to predict the risk and prognosis of lung metastasis (LM) in patients with different subtypes of BC and validate its performance. METHODS: A total of 1650 patients from the SEER database between 2011 and 2015 were enrolled in this study. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for breast cancer lung metastasis (BCLM). A nomogram was constructed using the independent prognostic factors. The concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC) value, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to test the prediction accuracy of the nomogram. External validation (n = 112) was performed using clinical data from the Affiliated Hospital of Qinghai University and the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested that age, grade, surgery, chemotherapy, subtype, and liver, bone, and brain metastases were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the median survival times of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, luminal A, luminal B, and triple-negative BC were 25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 20-37), 27 (95% CI, 23-29), 35 (95% CI, 30-44), and 12 (95% CI, 11-14), respectively. The C-indexes of the nomogram for predicting OS of the SEER training, SEER validation, and clinical validation cohorts were 0.7, 0.6, and 0.6, respectively, and the calculated AUCs at 3 years were 0.765, 0.794, and 0.799, respectively. The calibration curve indicates that the nomogram possessed a high level of accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our nomogram demonstrates significant predictive value, indicating that molecular subtypes, brain metastasis, and liver metastasis are closely associated with the prognosis of patients with LM.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. METHODS: We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing osimertinib, lazertinib, aumolertinib, befotertinib, furmonertinib, dacomitinib, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, and chemotherapy. Pooled estimations of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity (grade ≥ 3 adverse events) were performed within the Bayesian framework. RESULTS: Twenty-three trials involving 11 treatments were included. All EGFR-TKIs improved PFS relative to chemotherapy, except for icotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-1.44). All EGFR-TKIs demonstrated significant ORR benefits over chemotherapy. Osimertinib seemed to prolong PFS compared with icotinib (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.1-0.86), gefitinib (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21-0.74), and erlotinib (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29-1.0). In addition, osimertinib showed favorable superiority in improving OS compared with chemotherapy (HR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.43-0.82), gefitinib (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45-0.83), erlotinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48-0.89), and afatinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44-0.94). Among these regimens, afatinib showed the highest ORR (cumulative probability: 96.96%). Icotinib was associated with minimal toxicity among the EGFR-TKIs, followed by furmonertinib and osimertinib. Moreover, the toxicity spectra differed among the EGFR-TKIs. Subgroup analyses of patients with two common types of EGFR mutations indicated that furmonertinib possessed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with exon 19 deletion, and lazertinib showed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with Leu858Arg mutation. We also identified differences between EGFR-TKIs in prolonging PFS in patients with brain metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib is the first choice of treatment with considerable efficacy and safety for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The treatments associated with the best PFS in patients with exon 19 deletions and Leu858Arg mutations were furmonertinib and lazertinib, respectively.",

Concerns exist regarding the potential of WATVs to induce autoimmunity or the spread of cancer; however, their adverse events (AEs) have not been adequately studied. This literature review primarily aimed to evaluate the risks of autoimmunity and cancer seeding associated with using WATVs in human clinical trials. Its secondary objectives included assessing the incidence of AEs graded 1-5 using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were any clinical trial using human subjects in which at least part of the cancer vaccine was derived from the patient's own tumor tissue, which likely preserved the unique tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) present in the patient's tumor (i.e., whole-tissue). Tumor vaccine trials that used limited TAAs or highly processed tumor antigens were excluded. Published clinical trials were searched using Google Scholar until March 2024. The authors elaborated on the risk of bias in such cases, as indicated. All reviewed publications were searched for evidence of autoimmunity, cancer seeding, and other AEs. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 statement guided the review. RESULTS: Data from 55 human clinical trials, abstracts, case reports, and unpublished data were analyzed, including 3323 patients treated with WATVs for various cancers. The primary outcomes were: (1) no documented cases of WATV-induced autoimmunity, (2) no documented cases of WATV-induced spreading or seeding of noninfectious cancers, and (3) the observed 0.24% (2/838) risk of spreading or seeding infectious cancers was attributed to inadequate sterilization. The secondary outcomes were: (1) no deaths were attributed to WATV therapy, (2) 0.18% (6/3323) incidence of grade 4 AEs, (3) 0.42% (14/3323) incidence of grade 3 AEs, (4) the incidence of grades 1-2 AEs was 52.21% (478/916). CONCLUSIONS: WATVs carry no risk of inducing autoimmunity and essentially no risk of cancer seeding if properly sterilized. WATVs also exhibit a side effect profile comparable to that of routine vaccinations, with common, mild, and transient adverse effects. The combined risk of grade 3 and 4 AEs was 0.60% (20/3323).

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Despite the country's substantial liver cancer burden, there is limited research on the factors influencing the place of death (POD) of patients with liver cancer in China. This study aimed to delineate POD distribution among patients with liver cancer, identify the factors associated with hospital deaths, and offer valuable insights for the government to develop healthcare policies. METHODS: Data from 2013 to 2020 were obtained from the National Mortality Surveillance System (NMSS) of China. This analysis focused on the distribution of POD among individuals who succumbed to liver cancer. Variations in characteristic distributions across different categories were evaluated using a chi-squared test. We also applied a multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with hospital liver cancer deaths. The proportional change in variance was computed to evaluate the contributions of different factors in the model. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2020, the NMSS reported a total of 608,789 liver cancer-related deaths, of which 440,079 (72.29%) died at home, and 158,291 (26.00%) died in the hospital. Home remained the preferred POD among patients with liver cancer. The results demonstrated that female patients, aged between 0 and 14 years, of Han ethnicity, living in urban areas, unmarried, highly educated, and either employed in a professional, staff, or civil servant capacity, or retired patients tended to end their lives in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In China, home continues to be the predominant POD for patients with liver cancer, with demographic and socioeconomic factors significantly influencing whether a hospital is their POD. Enhancing healthcare policymakers' understanding of the factors influencing the place of death for patients with liver cancer may assist in creating a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources and providing a variety of choices for minorities with distinct preferences for end-of-life care.",

    "AbstractText": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, which increases the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In the pathophysiology of IBD, ubiquitination/deubiquitination plays a critical regulatory function. Josephin domain containing 2 (JOSD2), a deubiquitinating enzyme, controls cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. However, its role in IBD remains unknown. Colitis mice model developed by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or colon tissues from individuals with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease showed a significant upregulation of JOSD2 expression in the macrophages. JOSD2 deficiency exacerbated the phenotypes of DSS-induced colitis by enhancing colon inflammation. DSS-challenged mice with myeloid-specific JOSD2 deletion developed severe colitis after bone marrow transplantation. Mechanistically, JOSD2 binds to the C-terminal of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) and preferentially cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains at the K134 site, suppressing IMPDH2 activity and preventing activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inflammation in macrophages. It was also shown that JOSD2 knockout significantly exacerbated increased azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced CRC, and AAV6-mediated JOSD2 overexpression in macrophages prevented the development of colitis in mice. These outcomes reveal a novel role for JOSD2 in colitis through deubiquitinating IMPDH2, suggesting that targeting JOSD2 is a potential strategy for treating IBD.",

Currently, 15 ADCs have been clinically approved worldwide. More than 100 clinical trials at different phases are underway to investigate the newly developed ADCs. ADCs represent one of the fastest growing classes of targeted antitumor drugs in oncology drug development. It takes advantage of the specific targeting of tumor-specific antigen by antibodies to deliver cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs precisely to tumor cells, thereby producing promising antitumor efficacy and favorable adverse effect profiles. However, emergence of drug resistance has severely hindered the clinical efficacy of ADCs. In this review, we introduce the structure and mechanism of ADCs, describe the development of ADCs, summarized the latest research about the mechanisms of ADC resistance, discussed the strategies to overcome ADCs resistance, and predicted biomarkers for treatment response to ADC, aiming to contribute to the development of ADCs in the future.",

    "AbstractText": "Targeting drug delivery systems mediated by nanoparticles has shown great potential in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, influences of different tumor progressions on the accumulation of nanoparticles, especially the ligand-modified active targeting nanoparticles are seldom exploited. In this work, the accumulation and penetration of RGD-modified gold nanoparticles (active AuNPs) with different sizes were investigated in orthotopic breast cancer with different tumor progressions. The results showed that the smallest active AuNPs had better accumulation and permeation effects in early tumor tissues with the relatively looser extracellular matrix, larger gaps, lower interstitial fluid pressure, and less receptor expression, which was due to size effects. However, the larger active AuNPs had better accumulation and penetration effects in late tumor tissues with highly expressed target receptors integrin α v β 3 because of the multivalent interactions between larger active nanoparticles and integrin α v β 3. In the midterm, tumor accumulation of active AuNPs was equally influenced by size effects and multivalent interactions. Therefore, RGD-modified nanoparticles with sizes of 7 and 90 nm accumulated more in tumors. This study will guide a rational design of active targeting nanoparticles for enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of tumors based on their progressions.",

CD47-based anti-cancer therapy has received considerable attention, with a significant number of clinical trials conducted. While anti-cancer therapies based on CD47 remain a focal point of interest among researchers, it is noteworthy that an increasing number of studies have found that CD47-based therapy ameliorated the pathological status of non-cancer diseases. This review aims to provide an overview of the recent progress in comprehending the role of CD47-based therapy in non-cancer diseases, including diseases of the circulatory system, nervous system, digestive system, and so on. Furthermore, we sought to delineate the promising mechanisms of CD47-based therapy in treating non-cancer diseases. Our findings suggest that CD47-based agents may exert their effect by regulating phagocytosis, regulating T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, and regulating the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, we put forward the orientation of further research to bring to light the potential of CD47 and its binding partners as a target in non-cancer diseases.",

    "AbstractText": "Human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a flavoenzyme expressed at high levels in multiple solid tumors, making it an attractive target for anticancer drugs. Bioactivatable drugs targeting NQO1, such as β-lapachone (β-lap), are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. β-Lap selectively kills NQO1-positive (NQO1+) cancer cells by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) via catalytic activation of NQO1. In this study, we demonstrated that cryptotanshinone (CTS), a naturally occurring compound, induces NQO1-dependent necrosis without affecting NQO1 activity. CTS selectively kills NQO1+ cancer cells by inducing NQO1-dependent necrosis. Interestingly, CTS directly binds to NQO1 but does not activate its catalytic activity. In addition, CTS enables activation of JNK1/2 and PARP, accumulation of iron and Ca2+, and depletion of ATP and NAD+. Furthermore, CTS selectively suppressed tumor growth in the NQO1+ xenograft models, which was reversed by NQO1 inhibitor and NQO1 shRNA. In conclusion, CTS induces NQO1-dependent necrosis via the JNK1/2/iron/PARP/NAD+/Ca2+ signaling pathway. This study demonstrates the non-enzymatic function of NQO1 in inducing cell death and provides new avenues for the design and development of NQO1-targeted anticancer drugs.",

    "AbstractText": "High-performance phototheranostics with combined photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging have been considered promising approaches for efficient cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, developing phototheranostic materials with efficient photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), especially over the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), remains challenging. Herein, we report an ultraefficient NIR-II-activated nanomedicine with phototheranostic and vaccination capability for highly efficient in vivo tumor elimination and metastasis inhibition. The NIR-II nanomedicine of a semiconducting biradical oligomer with a motor-flexible design was demonstrated with a record-breaking PCE of 87% upon NIR-II excitation. This nanomedicine inherently features extraordinary photothermal stability, good biocompatibility, and excellent photoacoustic performance, contributing to high-contrast photoacoustic imaging in living mice and high-performance photothermal elimination of tumors. Moreover, a whole-cell vaccine based on a NIR-II nanomedicine with NIR-II-activated performance was further designed to remotely activate the antitumor immunologic memory and effectively inhibit tumor occurrence and metastasis in vivo, with good biosafety. Thus, this work paves a new avenue for designing NIR-II active semiconducting biradical materials as a promising theranostics platform and further promotes the development of NIR-II nanomedicine for personalized cancer treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: With global trends of carbon neutrality and ecofriendliness, the demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has been rapidly increasing. However, occupational health research within this sector is significantly lacking. Thus, this study aimed to understand the industrial value chain, processes, and current status of hazardous chemicals associated with LIBs. METHODS: Through a literature review and a survey of business sites, the LIB industry was categorized into 10 industrial groups. We visited 32 workplaces in the Republic of Korea, and conducted on-site surveys. RESULTS: Primary mineral raw materials used in LIBs include lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), and aluminum (Al) often in compound forms, alongside graphite, posing significant challenges in management due to their micrometer-sized particles. Furthermore, metals used in a salt form (such as LiOH or sulfate salts) can irritate the skin or respiratory system, particularly Ni and Co known to be toxic substances designated as human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Acids, bases, and various solvents are also used to improve batteries' electrical properties. Dichloromethane classified as carcinogenic 2A by the International Agency for Research on Cancer is widely used in the separator industry. Carbonate-based solvents are widely used in electrolytes with potential for exposure in battery cell manufacturers and recycling industries. However, they are not classified as regulated substances, leading to inadequate management practices. CONCLUSION: This study identified processes of each industry and chemical substances utilized in the LIB industry in the Republic of Korea. Based on this study, it is necessary to implement appropriate management measures tailored to industrial processes and types of harmful factors.",

    "AbstractText": "LncRNAs are RNA molecules of more than 200 nucleotides in length and participate in cellular metabolism and cellular responses through their diverse interactomedespite having no protein-coding capabilities. Such significant interactions also implicate the presence of lncRNAs in complex pathobiological pathways of various diseases, affecting cellular survival by modulating autophagy, inflammation and apoptosis. Proliferating cells harbour a complex microenvironment that mainly stimulate growth-specific activities such as DNA replication, repair, and protein synthesis. They also recognise damages at the macromolecular level, preventing them from reaching the next-generation. LncRNAs have shown significant association with the events occurring towards proliferation, regulating key events in dividing cells, and dysregulation of lncRNA transcriptome affects normal cellular life-cycle, promoting the development of cancer. Furthermore, lncRNAs also demonstrated an association with cancer growth and progression by regulating key pathways governing cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. This makes lncRNAs an attractive target for the treatment of cancer and can also be used as a marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases due to their differential expression in diseased samples. This review delves into the correlation of the lncRNA transcriptome with the fundamental cellular signalling and how this crosstalk shapes the complexity of the oncogenic microhabitat.",

Certain CNVs have been linked to various human disorders, such as intellectual disability, multiple congenital anomalies, autism spectrum disorders, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions, and cancer. The present study aims to classify brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, describe neurological manifestations, and discuss the findings within the context of genotype-phenotype correlations in a cohort of patients with recurrent and nonrecurrent CNVs. METHODS: A total of 21 patients with pathogenic CNV detected using microarray analysis were included in the study. RESULTS: Analysis of the clinical findings of the patient cohort showed that 16 (76%) had microcephaly, 14 had epilepsy (66%), 20 had facial dysmorphism (95%), and all had developmental delay (100%). Novel brain MRI findings were detected in six (6/13, 46%) patients with recurrent CNV and five (5/8, 63%) patients with nonrecurrent CNV. CONCLUSION: CNV-related disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with brain MRI findings suspicious for metabolic disorders. Brain MRI differences in patients with the same chromosomal deletion can be explained by the second-hit hypothesis. Additional single nucleotide variations and epigenetic factors in these cases may have led to the involvement of different regions of the brain. Revealing the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of cases in rare disorders will contribute to the widespread use of precision medicine and genetic treatment approaches in the near future.",

It is estimated that almost half of all cancer cases could be prevented by lifestyles changes. Cancer knowledge may be key to addressing this growing trend. This study focused on health students and its primary objective was to evaluate students' knowledge and perceptions about cancer. METHODS: In this study, the tool \"Students Knowledge and Perceptions about Cancer\" was used to retrieve quantitative data about students' knowledge. Their perceptions were evaluated using a Likert scale that ranged from \"Don't know\" to \"Know almost everything.\" This tool was shared on LinkedIn and Facebook, making the sampling method non-probabilistic. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From a sample of 170 health students, 72.4% (123) got more than half of the questions right. Lung cancer is the topic with lower knowledge. Overall, there seems to be a positive statistically significant correlation between students' knowledge and their perceptions about their knowledge (p ≤ 0.05). Despite the satisfactory levels of general knowledge about cancer, there should be more campaigns that are appealing to students that emphasise prevention as a mean to reduce cancer incidence. There is still work to be done to have more awareness among health students, especially regarding risk behaviours and screenings related to cancer.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: In Kazakhstan, the Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan has led to the establishment of 214 mobile teams funded by the Ministry of Health to offer in-home palliative care for terminal cancer patients. However, due to a shortage of trained and dedicated personnel, only about 25% of these teams provide high-quality, specialised care in the comfort of patient's homes, with the majority offering only consultative services. Given the country's sparse population, ensuring dedicated care is challenging and many staff members continue as part-time primary care workers. In this landscape, the 'Amazonka' Foundation's Hospice-On-Wheels initiative emerges as the sole NGO non-government organisation (NGO)-based service delivering in-home palliative care of comparable quality. Distinguished by its contract with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, Hospice-On-Wheels enjoys greater organisational flexibility and provides a broader spectrum of services, all while maintaining rigorous standards of multidisciplinary care. AIMS: The aims of this study are to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of an NGO-based in-home palliative care service in Kazakhstan and to discuss the qualitative methodology and its characteristics to Kazakhstani nurses, unfamiliar with quality nursing research. METHODS: The study commenced with a descriptive phenomenological approach and a service design methodology, later transitioning from phenomenological thematic analysis to content analysis. RESULTS: These rapid research findings highlight the exceptional effectiveness, customer satisfaction and cost-saving advantages of the NGO-based initiative. These benefits extend not only to the government and health authorities but also to patients and their families. The 'Amazonka' service significantly enhances the quality of life for incurable cancer patients through improved palliative care. Consequently, expanding their infrastructure and educational initiatives is essential to promote better palliative care in Kazakhstan, particularly in rural areas. DISCUSSION: The insights from this study can advocate for the home-based palliative care model employed by the 'Amazonka' team, encouraging its adoption by both governmental organisations and NGOs in Kazakhstan and beyond, thus opening new opportunities for local funding in resource-limited conditions.",

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is crucial for an accurate cancer evaluation, prognosis and treatment decision-making. To use IHC, a significant amount of facilities and capacity growth are needed. Because of this, it is crucial to comprehend the potential effects of IHC and identify the most essential reagents required to distinguish between typical diagnoses in our environment. OBJECTIVE: Employing IHC, this study aims to assess how well paediatric cancer diagnoses in Tanzania can be made and to identify the most widely used biomarkers for diagnostic distinction. METHODS: Pathology samples from kids who were given cancer diagnoses in 2018 at the Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza, Tanzania, were examined using H&E staining. Basic demographic information from the histology form was gathered in addition to the reported histopathology results from Bugando Medical Centre, including patient age, sex and sample collection. Muhimbili National Hospital received tissue from the histology block for the IHC examination. It was determined which reagents/biomarkers were required for diagnostic confirmation by comparing the histopathology data for diagnostic agreement, variations in diagnosis and other factors. RESULTS: The examinations included 105 (105) patients with paediatric cancer. 55.2% of the population, who had a median age of 6 years (IQR 3-9), were female. Burkitt and NHL-DLBCL were the paediatric diagnoses with the greatest pathology. The correlation between H&E and IHC histology was 51.0%. 17.6% (n = 18) of diagnoses had enhanced diagnostic specificity (e.g., NHL to diffuse large B cell lymphoma), and 31.4% of diagnoses were altered as a result of IHC. CONCLUSION: Considering that the diagnosis of juvenile cancer changes in about 30% of cases, IHC is crucial for accurate diagnosis. IHC retraining is crucial, and developing nations can successfully adopt a modest shared biomarker panel to improve therapy allocation.",

Western Africa has one of the highest mortality rates globally partly due to late presentation, often attributed to deficits in patient knowledge about the disease. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital among breast cancer patients. A structured questionnaire was utilised to collect data on patient demographics; sources of information on breast cancer; risk factors; symptoms; and treatment options. A chi-square test assessed the relationship between the participants' levels of knowledge and demographic characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined which sociodemographic factors predicted knowledge. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. This study enrolled 636 participants with a mean age of 52.6 ± 12.1 years. Television (TV) (63.4%) and radio (44.6%) were the main sources of information about breast cancer. Thirty-two percent of participants knew that family history was an associated risk factor for developing breast cancer. Eighty-three percent of the patients were familiar with self-breast examination, but only 42% of them practiced it. While 76% of participants knew that a breast mass could represent breast cancer, only 13%, 12% and 6% of participants identified nipple discharge, breast skin changes and changes in breast size as concerning symptoms of breast cancer, respectively. Only 7% of patients were aware of breast conservation as a treatment option. A higher educational level and higher monthly income were identified as predictors of a better level of knowledge, while age older than 60 years and advanced-stage disease correlated with decreased knowledge about breast cancer. Breast cancer awareness campaigns in Ghana should be expanded to include all Ghanaians, specifically women of lower socioeconomic status and older than 60 years. Educational messages should emphasise symptoms other than breast masses and the feasibility of breast-conserving surgery as a treatment option for early-stage disease.",

However, the impact of differential expression among ptgs2-positive tumours on CRC prognosis has not been well investigated. By sub-stratifying positive tumour expression, this study determined its potential influence on patients' outcomes. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas database was explored to determine CRC cases with RNA-Sequence (RNA-Seq) transcript data and matched clinicopathological data alongside gene copy number variation and methylation status. Descriptive, chi-square, Fisher exact, Linear-by-Linear associations, logistic and Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to determine proportions, associations, predictors and survival between ptgs2 and tumour parameters using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. Two-tailed p-value <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 534 CRC classified predominantly as adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (86.3%) and mucinous carcinoma (12.4) histologically included in this study. Marker (ptgs2) expression ranged from 0.02 FPKM-131.89 FPKM, (Median 1.4 FPKM). The majority of the cases (53.4%) were diagnosed at an early stage and showed high ptgs2 RNA-Sequence (RNA-seq) expression in 51.5% (275/534). Significant associations were seen between ptgs2 expression and histological subtype (p < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.013), pN2 stage (> 6 positive lymph nodes) (p = 0.011) and American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging stage (p = 0.028), and these all had lower ptgs2 expression. On regression analysis, histological differentiation emerged as a predictor of ptgs2 expression (Odds ratio 2.749, 95% confidence interval 1.479-5.108, p < 0.001). Also, gene methylation was associated with reduced ptgs2 expression. Overall survival was significantly inferior among individuals with low ptgs2 tumours (p = 0.018) while that for disease-free survival was non-significant (p = 0.327). CONCLUSION: CRCs with low ptgs2 transcripts are associated with poorer survival. This finding suggests a need for closer follow up and tailored adjuvant therapy for these patients.",

Unfortunately, there are scarce data regarding COX-2 expression in CRC in Africa where CRC incidence is on the increase with younger age affectation and unfavourable outcomes. AIMS: This retrospective study aims to determine the proportion of CRCs that over-express COX-2 and document any relationship between COX-2 over-expression with clinicopathological features such as histologic subtype, tumour grade, age and sex. METHODS: All the 139 CRCs that were histologically diagnosed at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital over a 5-year period were included, but only 124 Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned and stained with COX-2 antibody. COX-2 expression was scored for distribution (no cells = 0, 1%-10% = 1, 11%-50% = 2, 51%-80% = 3, 81%-100% = 4) and intensity (no stain = 0; weak = 1; moderate = 2, strong = 3). The immunoreactive score (IRS) is a product of intensity (I) and distribution (D) as: 9-12 strongly +, 5-8 moderately +, 1-4 weakly + and 0 negative. Over-expression of COX-2 is an IRS of 5-12. Outcomes were statistically evaluated with clinicopathological data. RESULTS: The CRCs occurred more commonly in males (M: F, 2:1), in the middle age group (mostly between 30 and 59 years), and 51.1% of cases occurred before 50 years and peaked in the 6th decade. Over-expression of COX-2 was observed in 46.8% (58/124) and was strongly associated with adenocarcinoma (ADC) not otherwise specified (NOS) (moderately and poorly differentiated tumours) but not with age or sex.

    "AbstractText": "The Indian childhood cancer initiative (ICCI) was established to address the critical gaps in childhood cancer care within India, where survival rates are significantly lower compared to high-income countries. While psychosocial support is a well-recognised component of comprehensive cancer care, its provision in India remains fragmented and inconsistent. This position statement, developed by the ICCI Psychological and Social Support Taskforce, outlines the urgent need for standardization of psychological and social care in pediatric oncology across the country. Informed by a thorough needs assessment and guided by international standards, this document proposes key areas of focus for integrating psychosocial support into pediatric cancer care. The taskforce identified eight priority areas essential for addressing the psychosocial needs of pediatric oncology patients and their families: ensuring holistic care through the integration of psychological and social support with medical treatment, early psychosocial assessment and intervention, interdisciplinary collaboration, community outreach, policy advocacy, research and the establishment of national standards for care. Early identification and intervention of psychosocial issues are critical to improving treatment adherence and overall patient outcomes. Furthermore, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between medical professionals, psychologists and social workers is essential for delivering comprehensive care. The taskforce emphasises the importance of advocacy at both the policy level and community level, raising awareness about the psychosocial needs of children with cancer. The statement also highlights the necessity of expanding research in psychosocial oncology, particularly within the Indian context, to develop culturally sensitive interventions. Establishing national standards for psychosocial care will ensure equitable access to these services, addressing current disparities in service provision. In conclusion, this position statement advocates for systemic changes in pediatric cancer care, integrating psychosocial services into treatment protocols, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and driving research and policy development to improve the quality of life for children with cancer and their families.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Financial toxicity in cancer palliative care in India: Addressing existence and beyond - Seeking remedies for a balanced financial journey.",
    "AbstractText": "Financial toxicity (FT) places a significant burden on individuals undergoing cancer care, leading to emotional distress, social isolation and financial burnout. In India, the growing number of cancer cases and the ever-expanding population, combined with insufficient government investment in public healthcare, inadequate insurance coverage, poor financial literacy among medical and non-medical communities and the lack of comprehensive financial planning exacerbate the financial difficulties faced by patients. This article aims to address FT as a source of suffering and explores potential frameworks and solutions for preventing and managing FT in patients undergoing cancer treatment and seeking palliative and hospice care in India. We conducted a literature search to review the burden of FT, across diverse healthcare settings for cancer patients. The prevalence of FT in cancer care ranges from 30% to 90.1% and is influenced by various socio-demographic, disease and healthcare-related factors. The sources of distress financing include consumption of savings, asset sales and borrowing, which add to the financial suffering. This interdisciplinary collaborative research paper highlights the dearth of financial literacy in our population and emphasises the pressing need to enhance financial awareness for healthcare professionals, cancer patients and their families. More than 30% of the Indian population lacks any form of insurance coverage, and many of those who do have it mostly lack 'adequate' coverage. We explore essential financial strategies, such as budgeting, expense analysis, asset consolidation, liquidity management, understanding estate planning tools and banking operations, streamlining paperwork, ensuring smooth transactions, adopting methods like low-interest loans and crowdfunding platforms, advance care planning, early palliative care ntegration and timely transition to hospice care. We also highlight the importance of available community resources, non-profit organisations, cancer foundations, health insurance and government support. Overall, integrating financial planning into cancer palliative care seems essential for reducing FT and enhancing the quality of cancer care in India. Further research on the topic is needed.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Breast cancer radiotherapy in Sub-Saharan Africa: a comparative study of acute toxicity between conventional and hypofractionated treatment regimens.",
    "AbstractText": "Hypofractionated radiotherapy for breast cancer has been increasingly adopted globally due to its comparable efficacy and reduced treatment burden. The study compared the incidence and severity of four main acute radiation-induced toxicities between breast cancer patients treated with conventional versus hypofractionated radiotherapy. Stratified purposive sampling was used to recruit participants into two groups: group #1 received conventional radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks), whereas group #2 received hypofractionated radiotherapy (40.05 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks). A closed-ended questionnaire administered by the researcher was used for quantitative data collection. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events tool (version 5) was used for grading acute toxicities. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 23). The study involved 53 patients with a mean age of 47.9 years (± 12.4) ranging from 26 to 75 years. The patients had breast cancer ranging from stage IIA (13.2%) to IIIC (9.4%). A considerable majority (62.3%) were treated with conventional fractionation whereas 37.7% were treated with a hypofractionated regimen. Dermatitis was the most prevalent side effect among patients in both groups #1 (67%) and #2 (70%). There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of dermatitis, pharyngitis, chest wall/ breast pain and fatigue between the two groups. However, the mean incidence of overall acute toxicity was significantly lower in group #2 (2.15 ± 1.14) compared with group #1 (2.42 ± 1.48), with a p-value of 0.001. Comparatively, the conventional 50 Gy dose regimen was associated with more acute radiation-induced toxicity.",

    "AbstractText": "India is facing a growing burden of cancer, resulting in high cancer-associated mortality. However, the rise in cancer incidence is disproportionately high compared to access and provision of palliative care. This review aims to identify gaps in Indian cancer palliative care and recognises initiatives instituted to mitigate them. The narrative review was conducted using the four-step method described by Demiris et al., synthesising both empirical and non-empirical literature. A lack of capacity to provide palliative care was identified as a significant barrier. Initiatives such as setting up palliative care services in cancer treatment centres, improving community palliative care access, structured palliative care training to develop specialists, improving opioid availability and creating policies have been helpful. A significant proportion of people in India experience health-related suffering, and developing a tool to identify this suffering proactively would be beneficial. Several cancer centres are testing integrated cancer palliative care models in various cancer subsites. However, these are preliminary works and are yet to be established. People in India face distress due to high health-related costs, and initiatives like hospices and home-based palliative care services with no cost to patients and families provide significant relief. Caregivers experience a considerable burden while caring for their loved ones with life-limiting illnesses, and they are supported through respite palliative care services offered in some parts of India.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Teaching empathy and compassion to healthcare providers in palliative care: a scoping review.",
    "AbstractText": "Empathy and compassion are core competencies that healthcare providers (HCPs) require when caring for patients and families with life-threatening illnesses like cancer. These constructs are often challenging to define and generalise and are often used interchangeably. Medical education has evolved from the traditional curriculum-based approach to a more eclectic competency-based approach. The purpose of this review is to explore the current evidence on teaching compassionate care for palliative care issues in cancer settings in lower-middle-income countries. A preliminary search of the Scopus database from 2,000 until now identified 1,502 records, of which 54 peer-reviewed articles were included in this review. Training in compassion and empathy was delivered in three formats: online, face-to-face and blended learning or hybrid. The training modalities were didactic, experiential and reflective, with many educational interventions using a multimodal approach. The educational interventions reported a positive outcome and improvement in empathetic and compassionate behaviours. However, they were limited due to inadequately defined constructs, use of self-reported outcome measures and difficulty in ascertaining if these skills were retained long-term and were translated into the clinical settings. Given that compassion and empathy are multidimensional constructs, it is imperative that educational interventions be multimodal and learner-centred, focusing on developing the knowledge, attitudes, skills and behaviours of the HCP in providing compassionate care while aiming for conceptual clarity regarding definition and more robust validated outcome measures.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Paediatric palliative care in cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "More than 21 million children globally need access to palliative care (PC) - including children with cancer. Providing Paediatric Palliative Care (PPC) for children with cancer is an ethical imperative with pain relief being recognised as a human right and an important public health consideration, with PPC being essential for reducing suffering in children and families. PPC addresses children's symptoms and aims to provide comfort even if a cure is not possible. PC for children with cancer is about ensuring that the child and family have the best possible quality of life starting at diagnosis and throughout the disease trajectory regardless of cancer treatment outcomes. Many principles of PPC for children with cancer are similar to those for children with other serious health conditions. These include the following: promotion of quality of life; provision of PC care across the continuum of care (from diagnosis through to bereavement); pain and symptom management; emotional support; social care; spiritual care; good communication with children and family; advance care planning; end-of-life care; and bereavement care. PPC should be provided across the range of care settings, wherever the child and their family need care, by an inter-disciplinary team providing support to the child, their families (including siblings) and other significant others, and consider the financial impact of having a child with cancer. It should not be a last resort, but an essential component of care. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the integration of PPC into paediatric cancer care through the review of challenges in providing PPC in paediatric oncology, global examples of clinical provision of PPC in paediatric cancer care, a review of global research priorities in this area and examples of global education programmes aimed at improving PPC in paediatric cancer care.",

    "ArticleTitle": "LAPTM4B enhances the stemness of CD133+ liver cancer stem-like cells via WNT/β-catenin signaling.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lysosome-associated protein transmembrane 4β (LAPTM4B) is an oncogene implicated in the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous research established a strong association between LAPTM4B and HCC stemness. However, specific mechanisms by which LAPTM4B regulates and maintains the stemness of liver cancer stem cells remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of LAPTM4B on the stemness regulation of cluster of differentiation 133 (CD133)+ liver cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs). METHODS: We used RNA interference and overexpression techniques in both in vitro and in vivo models. The involvement of LAPTM4B in wingless/integrated (WNT)/β-catenin signaling was examined through western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation. The impact of LAPTM4B on β-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination was analyzed to elucidate its role in promoting stemness. Clinical relevance was evaluated in an in-house cohort of 105 specimens from patients with HCC through immunohistochemical and microarray analysis, enabling investigation of correlations with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: LAPTM4B promoted the self-renewal ability, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity of CD133+ CSLCs. Mechanistically, aberrant LAPTM4B upregulation facilitated β-catenin nuclear translocation (nucleocytoplasmic separation assay, p <0.001) and inhibited its phosphorylation (p <0.01). In addition, LAPTM4B interacts with the deubiquitinating enzymes ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (USP)-1 and USP14, reducing β-catenin ubiquitination. Furthermore, patients with high LAPTM4B and β-catenin expression had markedly shorter 3-year overall survival rate (42.9% vs. 74.4%; hazard ratio, 5.174; 95% CI 2.280-11.741, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LAPTM4B promotes CD133+ CSLC stemness by activating WNT/β-catenin signaling by inhibiting β-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination degradation. The role of LAPTM4B in regulating WNT/β-catenin signaling suggests that LAPTM4B serves as a therapeutic target for impairing HCC stemness and progression. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: LAPTM4B contributes significantly to CD133+ CSLC stemness and inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination degradation, activating WNT/β-catenin signaling. WNT inhibitors suppress LAPTM4B-induced CD133+ CSLC stemness. Thus, targeting the LAPTM4B-WNT/β-catenin axis could improve antitumor efficacy.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent cancer among both men and women with 80% of patients having localized disease enabling curative treatments. Given the low recurrence rate in early-stage disease, there is a growing interest in reviewing follow-up protocols. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and timing of recurrence in early-stage colon cancer, as well as recurrence patterns. METHODS: The data from all patients with colon adenocarcinoma consecutively treated with surgery at the Instituto Português de Oncologia do Porto, EPE, between January 2013 and December 2016, were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 1,372 patients with colon cancer were submitted to surgery during the study period. From this group, 51.4% (n = 705) were early-stage colon cancers. Regarding the pathological stage, 3.5% were stage 0, 37.4% were stage I and 59.1% were stage II. The overall recurrence rate was 6.7%. When considering the group of patients without risk factors, the recurrence rate was 5.6%. The majority of recurrences occurred in the first 3 years of follow-up. The recurrence was diagnosed in the majority of patients through carcinoembryonic antigen elevation, followed by imaging exams. The presence of one or more risk factors (high nuclear grade, vascular invasion, extramural venous invasion, and perineural invasion) showed a statistically significant association with recurrence rate. CONCLUSION: The recurrence rate was low in early-stage colon cancer, with the majority of recurrences occurring in the first 3 years. Our study results show that surveillance should be tailored according to individual risk factors.",

We tested if gastric juice analysis allows to avoid unrewarding gastric biopsies. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent upper endoscopy with standard gastric biopsies. Real-time gastric juice analysis was performed with a specific device (EndoFaster®) that test ammonium concentration for H. pylori diagnosis, and pH values to suspect extensive atrophy/metaplasia involving gastric body mucosa. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), the overall accuracy, and the likelihood ratio were calculated for both H. pylori infection and extensive precancerous lesions on gastric mucosa. RESULTS: A total of 78 cirrhotic patients (males: 55; mean age: 66 ± 12 years) were enrolled. When considering as positive EndoFaster® results when at least one of two (ammonium and pH levels) tests were positive, the NPVs were as high as 89% and 86%, respectively, to rule out H. pylori and extensive precancerous lesions on gastric mucosa, with an overall accuracy of 83% and 74%. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the evidence that real-time gastric juice analysis allows to avoid clinically unrewarding and potentially unsafe gastric biopsies in a definite portion of cirrhotic patients, but more data are needed.",

Currently, the distinction between good and bad candidates for LOP is not clear, and the decision for surgical or non-surgical treatment depends on the patient's needs and desires, the experience and recommendation of the surgeon, the philosophy of the institution, and others. Nevertheless, the major disadvantage of LOP by CRT and NCT+RT is the potential need for salvage surgery due to tumor persistence after the application of full per-protocol treatment. Head and neck surgeons worldwide complain that in principle, salvage surgery is frequently possible after CRT but causes major complications and is not feasible in a relevant number of patients. While NCT+RT is globally used to select responders for LOP, NCT alone has not been shown to improve overall survival. Therefore, this procedure has lost its influence in standard head and neck cancer treatment beyond LOP. Recently, NCT as part of the perioperative transoral surgical treatment concept in head and neck cancer is gaining interest again. In addition to conventional chemotherapy, the combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors as a neoadjuvant concept has shown to be effective in non-controlled trials by opening a new door of encouraging treatment options for LOP.",

    "AbstractText": "As of 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the average life expectancy for both sexes in the United States is 77.5 years. While new advances in health have increased life expectancy, aging comes with complications that impact the development of diseases like cancer, senile dementia (non-Alzheimer), diabetes and Parkinson's. Through aging, the body's immune system declines, a process recognized as immunosenescence and which contributes to inflammaging, a state of chronic, though non-productive, inflammation that progresses with advancing age in the absence of overt infection and that contributes to the onset and progression of a spectrum of age-related pathologies. MicroRNAs are small forms of RNA that control gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cell cytoplasm. In particular, microRNA-941 (miR-941) has been found to play a critical role in the regulation of differentiation of cell populations, certain T cell subsets responsible for maintaining efficient immune surveillance in normal subjects, immune compromised individuals as well as the elderly. We propose that concerted research designed to define and characterize interventions targeting the regulatory effects of miRNA-941 specifically on T-cell subsets will benefit treatment of infectious (e.g., CoViD-19, H5N1 infection) and chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes II, diabetes III, Long Covid [i.e., Post-Acute Covid-19 Syndrome, PACS], autoimmune disease), which are most common among the aging and the immune compromised population. It is possible and even probable that active research in this specific area will proffer new horizons for finding cures, aid in disease management and improved accessibility and affordability of public health services.",

Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a pro-inflammatory chemokine with angiogenic activity, plays a pivotal role in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the association between IL-8 polymorphisms and OC risk. A novel non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP, c.193G>A; p.Glu65Leu) was identified in exon 2 of the IL-8 gene in 5 patients, 3 with stage III and 2 with stage II tumor. Structural analysis suggested that the p.Glu65Leu mutation alters the IL-8 protein conformation showing functional impairment. Thus, data shows that IL-8 c.193 G >A (Glu65Leu) polymorphism may contribute to tumor susceptibility. However, further studies are warranted to understand the role of IL-8 polymorphism in OC.",

The objective is to examine how HE4 and CA125 influence lymph node metastasis and to assess their diagnostic utility when paired with enhanced CT imaging to predict lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer. The study included 326 patients who underwent surgery for endometrial cancer (experimental group), alongside 98 individuals without cancer (control group). A retrospective analysis was carried out to assess the diagnostic efficacy of HE4 and CA125, in combination with enhanced CT, for predicting lymph node metastasis. Levels of HE4 and CA125 were measured and compared between the experimental and control groups, as well as within the lymph node-positive and -negative groups. Significant variations in HE4 and CA125 levels were found between the endometrial cancer and control groups, and between lymph node-positive and -negative subgroups within the endometrial cancer cohort (p < 0.001). The AUC for HE4 was 0.73 (p < 0.001) in premenopausal and 0.578 (p = 0.164) in postmenopausal groups. For CA125, the AUC was 0.81 (p < 0.001) in premenopausal and 0.671 (p = 0.002) in postmenopausal groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 336 patients who underwent TTMB between March 2017 and March 2023 were retrospectively reviewed, with 134 AS patients and 202 non-cancerous patients. All patients were routinely followed up via prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and follow-up biopsy was performed when deemed clinically appropriate. Treatment changes in the AS and cancer detection in the non-cancerous group were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the retrospective data, and the Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to indicate conversion to radical treatment in the AS group, as well as cancer detection in the previously benign non-cancerous group. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients under the AS protocol were analyzed, of whom 110 (82.1%) maintained AS for 33 months. Nine patients (6.7%) had significant findings in mpMRI [Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) ≥3] and received radical treatment following target biopsy via transrectal ultrasonography. A total of 115 patients (83.3%) with insignificant findings in mpMRI (PI-RADS 1 or 2 lesions) were followed up via transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (17.4%, N = 20), repeat TTMB (6.1%, N = 7), or no additional biopsy (76.5%, N = 88), and from each group, five (25.0%), two (28.5%), and eight (9.1%) patients converted to radical treatment. In the non-cancerous group, five patients (2.5%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with PI-RADS ≥ 3 findings via mpMRI, and were confirmed by target biopsy during a mean follow-up period of 25 months, subsequently receiving radical treatment.

    "ArticleTitle": "Advances in nanocarrier-mediated delivery of chrysin: Enhancing solubility, bioavailability, and anticancer efficacy.",
    "AbstractText": "Chrysin, a natural phytochemical compound found in various plant sources, possesses diverse pharmacological benefits, including anticancer, antioxidant, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, immunoregulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties. Despite its well-documented biological activities, chrysin's low water solubility and bioavailability hinder its clinical development. This review explores the application of nanocarriers as a strategic approach to overcome these challenges and enhance the delivery of chrysin. Nanocarriers, including polymer-based nanoparticles (NPs), lipid-based NPs, and inorganic nanocarriers, have shown promise in improving the solubility, bioavailability, and tumor-targeted delivery of chrysin. The paper discusses chrysin's anticancer effects on different types of human cancers, elucidating its impact on crucial signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis. The review categorizes and analyzes various nanocarriers, providing insights into their structural properties and drug release profiles. Among the nanocarriers, polymer-based NPs, especially those utilizing PLGA, emerge as promising strategies for chrysin encapsulation, demonstrating improvements in drug release, stability, and bioavailability. Lipid-based NPs and inorganic nanocarriers also exhibit potential in enhancing chrysin delivery.

    "ArticleTitle": "Identification of key pathways and molecular players potentially involved in endometrial cancer metastasis through integrated bioinformatics analyses.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Endometrial cancer (EC) is a particularly frequent gynecological cancer, and metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with EC. Using publicly accessible gene expression data, a bioinformatics study was carried out to increase our knowledge and reveal treatment targets for EC metastasis. This study aimed to identify new important molecular actors and clarify the molecular processes and pathways underlying EC metastasis. METHODS: The GEOexplorer and R programming languages were used to analyze and visualize gene expression data from EC metastatic gene expression datasets, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were identified using bioinformatics with P-value thresholds of < 0.05, and |log2FC| > 1.5. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology enrichment was used to enrich the observed DEGs, protein-protein interactions were established, and hub genes were identified. RESULTS: The findings revealed that DEGs were considerably enriched in a number of pathways, including the \"Pathways in cancer\", \"Breast cancer\", and \"Rap1 signaling pathway.\" DEGs were also found to be involved in a number of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular activities. The PPI network included the hub genes CTNNB1, FGFR3, ESR1, and SRSF3 as well as a number of DElncRNAs, such as LINC01541, SNHG17, LINC00520, BHLHE22-AS1, LOC100509445, H19, and HOTAIRM1. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular processes driving EC metastasis, which may result in the development of new treatment targets and indicators for the early identification of EC metastasis. More studies are needed to validate these findings and to understand the functional roles of these key factors in EC metastasis.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Drug self-delivery systems: A comprehensive review on small molecule nanodrugs.",
    "AbstractText": "Drug self-delivery systems are nanostructures composed of a drug as the main structural unit, having the ability of intracellular trafficking with no additional carrier. In these systems, the drug itself undertakes the functional and structural roles; thereby, the ancillary role of excipients and carrier-related limitations are circumvented and therapeutic effect is achieved at a much lower dose. Such advantages -which are mainly but not exclusively beneficial in cancer treatment- have recently led to an upsurge of research on these systems. Subsequently, various terminologies were utilized to describe them, referring to the same concept with different words. However, not all the systems developed based on the self-delivery approach are introduced using one of these keywords. Using a scoping strategy, this review aims to encompass the systems that have been developed as yet -inspired by the concept of self-delivery- and classify them in a coherent taxonomy. Two main groups are introduced based on the type of building blocks: small molecule-based nanomedicines and self-assembling hybrid prodrugs. Due to the diversity, covering the whole gamut of topics is beyond the scope of a single article, and, inevitably, the latter is just briefly introduced here, whereas the features of the former group are meticulously presented. Depending on whether the drug is merely a carrier for itself or carries a second drug as cargo, two classes of small molecule-based nanomedicines are defined (i.e., pure nanodrugs and carrier-mimicking systems, respectively), each having sub-branches. After introducing each branch and giving some examples, possible strategies for designing each particular system are visually displayed. The resultant mind map can create a macro view of the taken path and its prospects, give a profound insight into opportunities, spark new ideas, and facilitate overcoming obstacles. Taken together, one can foresee a brilliant future for self-delivery systems as a pioneering candidate for the next generation of drug delivery systems.",

    "AbstractText": "Elemene is widely recognized as an effective anti-cancer compound and is routinely administered in Chinese clinical settings for the management of several solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its detailed molecular mechanism has not been adequately demonstrated. In this research, it was demonstrated that elemene effectively curtailed NSCLC growth in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Mechanistically, employing high-throughput screening techniques and subsequent biochemical validations such as microscale thermophoresis (MST), microRNA-145-5p (miR-145-5p) was pinpointed as a critical target through which elemene exerts its anti-tumor effects. Interestingly, elemene serves as a binding stabilizer for miR-145-5p, demonstrating a strong binding affinity (dissociation constant (K D) = 0.39 ± 0.17 μg/mL) and preventing its degradation both in vitro and in vivo, while not interfering with the synthesis of the primary microRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). The stabilization of miR-145-5p by elemene resulted in an increased level of this miRNA, subsequently suppressing NSCLC progression through the miR-145-5p/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3)/nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) pathway. Our findings provide a new perspective on revealing the interaction patterns between clinical anti-tumor drugs and miRNAs.",

    "AbstractText": "Over the past half-century, modelling has come to play an increasingly important role in cancer research. These representational tools frame perceptions of malignant disease, guide public health responses, and help determine which interventions are necessary. But what makes a cancer model a model? What authority do they have? What stories do they tell? And how do they shape our understanding of disease and bodies? To shed light on these questions, this article explores the long history of cancer modelling in sub-Saharan Africa: a place where malignant disease has often been imagined as different, and where experimentation and improvisation in cancer research and treatment has been rife. Drawing on archival and ethnographic sources, we examine modelling strategies that health professionals have used to generate information about cancer in Africa from the mid 20th century to the present day. Focusing on three different case studies - anatomical models of Burkitt's lymphoma patients, diagnostic models for Kaposi sarcoma, and statistical models of the African smoking and lung cancer epidemic - we meditate on the multiplicity of models and modelling by identifying the epistemic strands that hold these representations together, as well as what sets them apart. In addition to contributing to discussions of how cancer research has taken shape beyond the Anglo-American realm, our article helps expand and complicate our understandings of what a disease model is.",

    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: A 69-year-old multiparous postmenopausal woman had undergone bilateral total hip arthroplasty 17 years ago. Computed tomography showed a mature teratoma of 10 cm in the pelvis. Subsequently, she presented with symptoms of hoarseness and weight loss, along with evidence of malignant transformation of the same tumor in the pelvis and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Bilateral adnexectomy was performed via laparotomy, yet peritoneal dissemination persisted. The ovarian tumor's histopathological diagnosis was mature teratoma with squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the mediastinal lymph nodes biopsy revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma. Comprehensive genomic profiling testing of the ovarian tumor showed pathogenic variants of TP53 and PTEN, a high tumor mutational burden, homologous recombination deficiency and the absence of human papilloma virus. The similar genomic testing of the mediastinal tumor revealed three variants of uncertain significance that were common to the ovarian tumor. However, no variants of TP53 or PTEN were identified. Following surgery, she demonstrated a partial response to six cycles of conventional paclitaxel and carboplatin. She then received maintenance treatment with niraparib; however, disease progression subsequently occurred. The patient was treated with pembrolizumab and is currently receiving treatment with a partial response. Previous reports have demonstrated the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in 5 out of 6 cases of malignant transformation of mature teratomas, and this treatment appears to be a promising strategy.

    "AbstractText": "While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is ubiquitous globally, a high-risk EBV subtype associated with the extremely high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was found in southern China, but the evolution history of EBV in humans and the origin of this high-risk subtype remains enigmatic. By obtaining one of the largest datasets of EBV genomes across the world, we found that EBV had an evolutionary history matching the out-of-Africa migration of humans. Within the high-risk subtype from southern China, we identified a rapidly expanding clonal strain originating from a recombination event between EBV strains from northern and southern Chinese around 4000 years ago, followed by strong Darwinian evolution with a fitness advantage of 4%. The clonal strain has almost doubled the risk for NPC compared to the high-risk subtype and explained around 66% of the NPCs, representing the highest risk factor for NPC identified so far. Taken together, we unraveled a strong co-evolution history between EBV and humans where human migration and admixture triggered subsequent recombination and expansion of a highly advantageous EBV strain, leading to a cancer epidemic in southern China.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of super-resolution (SR) T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) based on ACS in rectal cancer (RC) by comparing with compressed sensing (CS) and parallel imaging (PI). METHODS: In this prospective study, 29 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled, and three groups of SR rectal T2WI images based on ACS, CS, and PI (ACS-T2WI, CS-T2WI, and PI-T2WI) were obtained, using the same scanning time for each group. Two radiologists independently assessed the visibility of structures, tissue edge sharpness, image artifacts, overall image quality, and confidence in N staging for the three sequences using a five-point Likert scale; the scores of the three sequences were compared and the agreement between two readers was assessed. In addition, the quantitative parameters of the three groups, sharpness, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared. T staging based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed by two readers separately using the three sequences combined with other conventional scanning sequences. The consistency between T staging based on MRI (mrT staging) and pathological T staging (PT staging) of the two readers and the diagnostic accuracy of every sequence was compared. RESULTS: The scores of ACS-T2WI were higher in visibility of structures, tissue edge sharpness, overall image quality, and confidence in N staging than CS-T2WI and PI-T2WI (P<0.001). There was no statistical difference in the scores of image artifacts among the three sequences (P=0.18). The sharpness of ACS-T2WI was higher than that of CS-T2WI and PI-T2WI (P<0.001). The SNR of CS-T2WI was slightly higher than that of ACS-T2WI and PI-T2WI (P=0.004). There was no statistically significant difference in CNR among the three sequences (P=0.425). The consistency between mrT staging of ACS-T2WI and PT staging was higher than that of CS-T2WI and PI-T2WI. The two readers had a higher diagnostic accuracy for ACS-T2WI (89.66%) than for CS-T2WI (79.31%) and PI-T2WI (75.86%), but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: By using ACS to increase the resolution through a larger matrix size, higher quality images can be obtained within the same scanning time as traditional acceleration techniques. The SR T2WI based on ACS can be well applied in the clinical scanning of RC.",

    "AbstractText": "Multimodal imaging has emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Ideally, it combines multiple imaging techniques to provide complementary anatomical and molecular information in living subjects. Particularly desirable are multimodal imaging probes capable of providing differential diagnostic signals upon interaction with specific molecular targets. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key target in this regard, since it is typically overexpressed in cancer cells. In this study, we present a small-molecule probe that not only selectively detects endogenous H2O2 through multimodal imaging, with a significant H2O2-triggered 15-fold fluorescence enhancement but also turns \"on\" a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance (MR) response with 60-fold signal enhancement at pH 7.4. Excellent selectivity against various other biologically relevant species is seen. Using this probe, we observed 3.4-4.5-fold and 2.8-5.8-fold higher H2O2 levels in cancerous cell lines and tumor tissues compared to normal cell lines and tissues, respectively. Time-dependent in vivo fluorescence and CEST imaging in a HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) tumor xenograft mouse model revealed probe-dependent tumor detection by fluorescence and CEST MRI contrast in the tumor area. These observations are attributed to the relatively high endogenous H2O2 levels produced during mitosis. This newly developed probe holds promise for advancing our understanding of H2O2-related biology and for cancer detection both in vitro and in vivo.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: According to epidemiological data, ovarian cancer is diagnosed in 240,000 women per year, which is why it is the seventh most common cancer among women worldwide. In addition, among gynaecological cancers it is characterized by the highest mortality. However, there is still no effective treatment, which is why maintenance therapies have a decisive impact on the quality of life of patients. Cerrena unicolor is an example of a medical fungus that produces a laccase enzyme (LAC), as well as synthesizing low-molecular secondary metabolites with a wide spectrum of biological activity. LAC, as demonstrated previously, shows cytotoxic and anti-side activity against cancer cells. The aim of the study was to assess the anti-cancer properties of the extract from the mushroom Cerrena unicolor against ovarian cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out on two cellular lines of ovarian cancer: NIH:OVCAR-3 and Caov-3, differing in sensitivity to platinum compounds. In the first stage of the study, the values of the concentration of Cerrena unicolor extract were determined, at which point growth and proliferation were inhibited without a cytotoxic effect in the tested cell lines. For this purpose, classic MTT and BrdU tests were used. The second stage of the study consisted in examining the impact of the preparation on the proliferative and migration potential of cancer cells, using the ECIS system. RESULTS: The study showed that the examined laccase showed cytotoxic and antiproliferative effect on the cells of the tested cancer lines. CONCLUSIONS: Following previous and current studies on Cerrena unicolor, extracts obtained from this fungus can be safely used in anticancer therapy or chemoprevention with no significant harmful effects on normal cells.",

Interruptions in treatment, however, may have a negative impact on the final outcome. External factors, such as evacuation from conflict zones, contribute to vulnerability to infections and constitute a factor for the discontinuation of therapy. The aim of the review is to present recent knowledge of catheter-related sepsis and tuberculosis (TB) in children with acute leukemia. The case is also presented of an adolescent male of Ukrainian origin. The study draws attention to the challenges in treating patients from other regions due to differences in health status. REVIEW METHODS: The article presents a rare case report connected with a literature review, based on the Google Scholar, PubMed and Web of Science databases from recent years. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: Many factors increase susceptibility to infections. Both leukemia itself as well as its intensive therapy influence immunosuppression. Invasive procedures disrupt physiological barriers. The presence of a central or peripheral catheter poses a main source of bloodstream infection. Deficiencies of immunity are conducive to reactivation of latent diseases such as TB, to which children are prone to develop severe forms. Therefore, treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) in paediatric patients is crucial. In diagnosis, vigilance is particularly important in patients coming from high incidence regions with low vaccine coverage. SUMMARY: Discontinuation of therapy due to infection or other external circumstances may contribute to treatment failure. Early detection is significant to prevent complications of diseases and interruptions in chemotherapy.

Nevertheless, the expression of miRNA-335 in prostate cancer (PCa) and its clinical significance remain unelucidated. Here, we report that miRNA-335 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating expression of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), a key enzyme of glutamine metabolism pathway, in PCa. In this study, we show that the expression of miRNA-335 is downregulated in PCa tissues. The level of miRNA-335 is even lower in highly invasive PCa cell lines. Furthermore, enhancing the expression of miRNA-335 inhibits PCa cell migration and invasion in vitro. Additionally, we identify GLS1 as the downstream effector, governed by miRNA-335 via 3'-untranslated region, and the direct regulation is verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. MiRNA-335 interrupts glutamine catabolism by inhibiting GLS1 enzymatic activity. Overexpression of miRNA-335 markedly suppresses tumor growth of PCa in vivo. To sum up, our results indicate that miRNA-335 acts as a tumor suppressor and has an important role in restraining the metastasis of PCa cells by targeting GLS1. These discoveries indicate that miRNA-335 could serve as a new prospective therapeutic target for PCa.

Circadian rhythm disruption can lead to health issues, such as insomnia, mental illness, chronic diseases, and cancer. However, the impact of ergothioneine, as an antioxidant, on oxidative DNA damage and immune variations caused by circadian rhythm disruptions remains unclear. To investigate the effect of ergothioneine on oxidative DNA damage and immune responses caused by circadian rhythm disruption, 8-week-old mice were subjected to night time feeding and exercise restrictions for 14 days. Body weight, daytime running wheel activity, and anxiety-like behavior showed no significant differences between the night-restricted groups, regardless of ergothioneine administration. Serum interleukin-6 levels, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in urine and nuclear DNA of the liver, testes, lungs, and pancreas were significantly reduced in the night-restricted group receiving ergothioneine compared with that of the group without ergothioneine, with no significant differences observed when compared to the control group. Ergothioneine can mitigate immune function changes and oxidative DNA damage induced by circadian rhythm disruption caused by abnormal dietary timing in mice. However, it did not alleviate obesity or mental state dysregulation.

This study aimed to explore the association between family history of lung cancer and allergic rhinitis, along with potential mediating mechanisms, using Mendelian randomization. METHODS: A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to assess the causal relationship between family history of lung cancer (including parental, paternal, maternal, and sibling histories) and allergic rhinitis, using genetic variants associated with family history of lung cancer as instrumental variables. Additionally, mediation Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to investigate the role of specific metabolites in mediating this relationship. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant causal relationship between parental history of lung cancer and allergic rhinitis, with maternal lung cancer history showing a strong protective effect against allergic rhinitis (OR = 0.28, p<0.05). Mediation analysis further indicated that metabolites such as 1-linoleoyl-GPE (18:2) and N-palmitoyl-sphingosine exhibited negative mediating effects in the association between maternal lung cancer and allergic rhinitis. Lower levels of these metabolites enhanced the protective effect of maternal lung cancer history on allergic rhinitis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant causal relationship between maternal lung cancer history and allergic rhinitis, with specific metabolites potentially playing a mediating role. Changes in the levels of 1-linoleoyl-GPE (18:2) and N-palmitoyl-sphingosine are associated with the protective effect of maternal lung cancer history on allergic rhinitis, suggesting that metabolites may be crucial in regulating this relationship.

The low and middle-income countries (LMICs) cover a major share of the global cancer burden; however, most of the LMICs including Nepal still lack national cancer control and prevention strategies. Since 1st January 2018, the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) started the population-based cancer registry (PBCR) in urban, suburban, and rural regions to support evidence-based cancer control intervention in each geographical region. METHODS: Data regarding incidence and mortality was collected by the PBCR in Nepal. Indirect and direct methods were used to collect data from health facilities and communities, respectively. Registered cases of incidence and mortality from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019 were used. Each case was verified for correctness and duplication followed by residence confirmation via phone call. Guidelines and principles of the International Association of Cancer Registry were followed for the overall registration process including data quality control. Ethical approval was taken from the Ethical Review Board of the NHRC. RESULT: Age-adjusted incidence (AAR) and mortality rates in Nepal were found 65.6 and 29 per 100,000 people, respectively. Every 1 in 14 men and 1 in 13 women were at risk of getting, and 1 in 28 men and 1 in 33 women were dying of cancer before age 75 in Nepal. The highest risk was found for lung cancer (1 in 80) followed by stomach and mouth among men, and in women, breast cancer (1 in 76) was the commonest among all followed by lung and cervix. CONCLUSION: Cancer has been growing as one of the major public health burdens in Nepal. Screening with cost-effective technology, awareness, and vaccination against HPV should be a government priority including revision of treatment protocols for cancers that have higher mortality to prevent further preventable life loss from malignancies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Vitamin D and its analogs in immune system regulation.",
    "AbstractText": "Vitamin D was discovered as the cure for nutritional rickets, a disease of bone growth arising from inadequate intestinal calcium absorption, and for much of the 20th century, it was studied for its critical role in calcium homeostasis. However, we now recognize that the vitamin D receptor and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are expressed in numerous tissues unrelated to calcium homeostasis. Notably, vitamin D signaling can induce cellular differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the vitamin D receptor and the enzyme CYP27B1, which produces the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), are expressed throughout the immune system. In addition, CYP27B1 expression in immune cells is regulated by physiological inputs independent of those controlling its expression in calcium homeostatic tissues. These observations have driven the development of 1,25D-like secosteroidal analogs and nonsecosteroidal analogs to separate the effects of vitamin D on cell differentiation and function from its calcemic activities. Notably, some of these analogs have had considerable success in the clinic in the treatment of inflammatory and immune-related disorders. In this review, we described in detail the mechanisms of vitamin D signaling and the physiological signals controlling 1,25D synthesis and catabolism, with a focus on the immune system. We also surveyed the effects of 1,25D and its analogs on the regulation of immune system function and their implications for human immune-related disorders. Finally, we described the potential of vitamin D analogs as anticancer therapeutics, in particular, their use as adjuncts to cancer immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Vitamin D signaling is active in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Numerous vitamin D analogs, developed primarily to minimize the dose-limiting hypercalcemia of the active form of vitamin D, have been used widely in preclinical and clinical studies of immune system regulation. This review presents a description of the mechanisms of action of vitamin D signaling, an overview of analog development, and an in-depth discussion of the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D analogs.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Shared molecular, cellular, and environmental hallmarks in cardiovascular disease and cancer: Any place for drug repurposing?",
    "AbstractText": "Cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the 2 biggest killers worldwide. Specific treatments have been developed for the 2 diseases. However, mutual therapeutic targets should be considered because of the overlap of cellular and molecular mechanisms. Cancer research has grown at a fast pace, leading to an increasing number of new mechanistic treatments. Some of these drugs could prove useful for treating CVD, which realizes the concept of cancer drug repurposing. This review provides a comprehensive outline of the shared hallmarks of cancer and CVD, primarily ischemic heart disease and heart failure. We focus on chronic inflammation, altered immune response, stromal and vascular cell activation, and underlying signaling pathways causing pathological tissue remodeling. There is an obvious scope for targeting those shared mechanisms, thereby achieving reciprocal preventive and therapeutic benefits. Major attention is devoted to illustrating the logic, advantages, challenges, and viable examples of drug repurposing and discussing the potential influence of sex, gender, age, and ethnicity in realizing this approach. Artificial intelligence will help to refine the personalized application of drug repurposing for patients with CVD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the 2 biggest killers worldwide, share several underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. So far, specific therapies have been developed to tackle the 2 diseases. However, the development of new cardiovascular drugs has been slow compared with cancer drugs. Understanding the intersection between pathological mechanisms of the 2 diseases provides the basis for repurposing cancer therapeutics for CVD treatment. This approach could allow the rapid development of new drugs for patients with CVDs.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The Hippo pathway: Organ size control and beyond.",
    "AbstractText": "The Hippo signaling pathway is a highly conserved signaling network for controlling organ size, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. It integrates a wide range of intracellular and extracellular signals, such as cellular energy status, cell density, hormonal signals, and mechanical cues, to modulate the activity of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators. A key aspect of Hippo pathway regulation involves its spatial organization at the plasma membrane, where upstream regulators localize to specific membrane subdomains to regulate the assembly and activation of the pathway components. This spatial organization is critical for the precise control of Hippo signaling, as it dictates the dynamic interactions between pathway components and their regulators. Recent studies have also uncovered the role of biomolecular condensation in regulating Hippo signaling, adding complexity to its control mechanisms. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway is implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly cancer, where alterations in YAP/TAZ activity contribute to tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Therapeutic strategies targeting the Hippo pathway have shown promise in both cancer treatment, by inhibiting YAP/TAZ signaling, and regenerative medicine, by enhancing YAP/TAZ activity to promote tissue repair. The development of small molecule inhibitors targeting the YAP-TEAD interaction and other upstream regulators offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The Hippo signaling pathway is a key regulator of organ size, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration, with its dysregulation linked to diseases such as cancer. Understanding this pathway opens new possibilities for therapeutic approaches in regenerative medicine and oncology, with the potential to translate basic research into improved clinical outcomes.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Pharmacological treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and related disorders: Current and emerging therapeutic options.",
    "AbstractText": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) is a chronic liver disease affecting over a billion individuals worldwide. MASLD can gradually develop into more severe liver pathologies, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, and liver malignancy. Notably, although being a global health problem, there are very limited therapeutic options against MASLD and its related diseases. While a thyroid hormone receptor agonist (resmetirom) is recently approved for MASH treatment, other efforts to control these diseases remain unsatisfactory. Given the projected rise in MASLD and MASH incidence, it is urgent to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies against these prevalent liver diseases. In this article, the pathogenic mechanisms of MASLD and MASH, including insulin resistance, dysregulated nuclear receptor signaling, and genetic risk factors (eg, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 and hydroxysteroid 17-β dehydrogenase-13), are introduced. Various therapeutic interventions against MASH are then explored, including approved medication (resmetirom), drugs that are currently in clinical trials (eg, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, fibroblast growth factor 21 analog, and PPAR agonist), and those failed in previous trials (eg, obeticholic acid and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 antagonist). Moreover, given that the role of gut microbes in MASLD is increasingly acknowledged, alterations in the gut microbiota and microbial mechanisms in MASLD development are elucidated. Therapeutic approaches that target the gut microbiota (eg, dietary intervention and probiotics) against MASLD and related diseases are further explored. With better understanding of the multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms, the development of innovative therapeutics that target the root causes of MASLD and MASH is greatly facilitated. The possibility of alleviating MASH and achieving better patient outcomes is within reach. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, and it can progress to more severe pathologies, including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases has facilitated the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Moreover, increasing evidence has illustrated the crucial role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of MASLD and related diseases. It may be clinically feasible to target gut microbes to alleviate MASLD in the future.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Cell cycle dysregulation in cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "Cancer is a systemic manifestation of aberrant cell cycle activity and dysregulated cell growth. Genetic mutations can determine tumor onset by either augmenting cell division rates or restraining normal controls such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. As a result, tumor cells not only undergo uncontrolled cell division but also become compromised in their ability to exit the cell cycle accurately. Regulation of cell cycle progression is enabled by specific surveillance mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints, and aberrations in these signaling pathways often culminate in cancer. For instance, DNA damage checkpoints, which preclude the generation and augmentation of DNA damage in the G1, S, and G2 cell cycle phases, are often defective in cancer cells, allowing cell division in spite of the accumulation of genetic errors. Notably, tumors have evolved to become dependent on checkpoints for their survival. For example, checkpoint pathways such as the DNA replication stress checkpoint and the mitotic checkpoint rarely undergo mutations and remain intact because any aberrant activity could result in irreparable damage or catastrophic chromosomal missegregation leading to cell death. In this review, we initially focus on cell cycle control pathways and specific functions of checkpoint signaling involved in normal and cancer cells and then proceed to examine how cell cycle control and checkpoint mechanisms can provide new therapeutic windows that can be exploited for cancer therapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: DNA damage checkpoints are often defective in cancer cells, allowing cell division in spite of the accumulation of genetic errors. Conversely, DNA replication stress and mitotic checkpoints rarely undergo mutations because any aberrant activity could result in irreparable damage or catastrophic chromosomal missegregation, leading to cancer cell death. This review focuses on the checkpoint signaling mechanisms involved in cancer cells and how an emerging understanding of these pathways can provide new therapeutic opportunities for cancer therapy.",

This study aimed to evaluate prospectively how circulating levels of sex hormones and sex hormones binding globulin (SHBG) are associated with volumetric percent density (VPD, %) and absolute breast dense volume (DV, cm3) measured after an average 13.5 years of follow up. We included 422 post- and 445 pre-menopausal women enrolled in the Florence section of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Blood levels of circulating sex hormones and SHBG were determined in serum samples collected at enrollment. The automated Volpara™ density software was used to obtain DV and VPD measures from the first available full-field digital mammography performed after enrollment. We carried out adjusted linear regression models for post-menopausal and pre-menopausal women, separately. Higher baseline blood levels of SHBG were associated with higher VPD both in post-menopausal (%Diff 17.2 III vs. I tertile, p-value 0.02, p-trend 0.02) and pre-menopausal women (%Diff 21.1 III vs. I tertile, p-value 0.004, p-trend 0.004). Among pre-menopausal women a modifying effect of parity emerged, with significant inverse associations of estradiol, free estradiol, estrone, and free testosterone with VPD in women with a lower number of births or higher age at every birth. DV was not associated with sex hormones or SHBG. A direct association between increasing serum level of SHBG and VPD was observed both in post- and pre-menopausal women.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is a nonspecific plasma biomarker for tissue injury that has been validated for monitoring acute rejection (AR) after lung transplantation (LT). However, no studies to date have focused specifically on single lung transplantation (SLT). Herein, we report the performance of dd-cfDNA in detecting AR in SLT from 6 academic centers that implemented this biomarker surveillance in their standard of practice (SOP). METHODS: dd-cfDNA test results were corrected for SLT by an algorithm in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory to permit comparison against the same 1.0% threshold used in double-lung transplant. Investigators reviewed patient SOP electronic medical record clinical data to assign test results into cohorts based on clinical allograft health status. To avoid ambiguity in interpretation, samples drawn after a prior AR or infection event or without histopathologic confirmation of AR were excluded from further analysis. Diagnostic cohorts included AR (N=25 samples), healthy (STABLE, N=137), allograft infection (INFXN, N=41), chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD, N=7), and \"OTHER\" types of graft injury (N=12). RESULTS: The study included a total of 257 dd-cfDNA results from 103 SLT patients with one patient excluded due to active cancer. Samples were drawn a median of 233 days (interquartile range: 96-489) after SLT. Laterality for SLT (R vs L) and median dd-cfDNA fraction in AR and STABLE cohort were not statistically different. The median dd-cfDNA fraction was elevated with AR (1.8%) and INFXN (1.1%) vs STABLE (0.46%; p < 0.0001). dd-cfDNA with CLAD was also significantly higher than STABLE cohort (p = 0.0155). The area under receiver operator characteristics curve was 0.850 (95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.95, p < 0.0001) for AR vs STABLE cohort. Applying the dd-cfDNA threshold ≥1.0% for detection of AR yielded a sensitivity = 77.8%, specificity = 84.6%, positive predictive value = 38.31%, and negative predictive value = 96.83%. CONCLUSIONS: These multicenter data, incorporating real-world experiences, support the clinical validity and utility of dd-cfDNA monitoring of SLT recipients.

    "ArticleTitle": "Research Progress of EMR2 Receptor Function in Glioma and its Potential Application as Therapeutic Target.",
    "AbstractText": "The most frequent primary brain malignancy is glioma. Alterations in several adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are present in cancer as they regulate adhesion, migration, and guidance. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) module-containing mucin-like receptor 2 (EMR2) is included in group II GPCRs and functionally in a family of brain angiogenesis inhibitor molecules (BAIs). Recent studies have shown that BAIs regulate phagocytosis and synaptogenesis, and their extracellular domain inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. In neoplastic processes, EMR2 appears to play a role in disease aggressiveness, patient survival rates, and tumor grade. This review summarizes the EMR2 involvement in cellular mechanisms and pathologies, particularly in cancer. We searched the Pubmed Central, Google Scholar and Scopus databases for terms \"EMR2\" and \"glioma\". The initial search yielded a total of 92 results. After excluding studies not written in English, based on design, and excluding duplicates and non-relevant studies, we included 38 studies in the review. EMR2 was shown to be expressed in various histologic grades of gliomas and to be linked to the PI3K pathway, as both are upregulated in glioblastoma after bevacizumab therapy. The PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in tumorigenesis, and upregulation of EMR2 may in turn upregulate PI3K, leading to increased tumor invasiveness. Indeed, overexpression of EMR2 was associated with the mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype, tumor invasiveness, and poor survival. EMR2 also regulates neutrophil function by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and degranulation. Possible therapeutic approaches have been studied, such as the stimulation of microglia and monocytes to inhibit tumor-initiating cells by down-regulating the EMR2 gene or through an antibody against EMR2. The current review summarizes the knowledge about the EMR2 receptor that can serve as motivation for future studies on its role in the clinical evolution and tumor biology of gliomas in order to find new modulator therapeutic approaches.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Surgeons are apprehensive to use DCD lungs despite similar post-transplant outcomes: A 20-year UNOS retrospective analysis.",
    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: As rates of lung transplants in the US grow, waitlist mortality increases. While the literature reports similar survival outcomes of DBD and DCD transplants, research should investigate improvements to DCD lung recovery protocols to increase the total number recovered. Recently, Choi et al. presented donor variables indicative of ultimate lung recovery1. However, expansion of DCD lung transplants requires a comparison of these indicators to DBD donors for application of similar parameters to increase the rate of DCD lung recovery to ensure that viable DCD organs are not discarded due to overly stringent donor and organ requirements. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of United Network for Organs Sharing (UNOS) Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/UNOS STAR (Standard Analysis and Research) database. Donors who donated ≥1 organ from 10/1999-01/2019 were extracted and stratified according to DBD and DCD status. Associated characteristics of potential DCD and DBD lung donors were compared, and a multivariable logistic regression model with ≥1 transplanted lung was constructed to evaluate the independent effects of important predictors. RESULTS: Our data included 179,228 potential lung donors, 162,157 DBD (31,486 donated, 19.4% recovery) and 17,071 DCD (526 donated, 3.1% recovery). Odds of lung non-use between DBD and DCD donors were significantly associated with blood type, alcohol use, cause of death, smoking history, drug use, death circumstance, ethnicity, gender, hypertension, cancer, age, and lung pO2 on 100% P/F ratio (P < 0.001 for all variables). A multivariable regression analysis showed that the odds of a potential DCD donating lungs is 75% lower than (P < 0.001) that of a potential DBD when the cause of death (COD) is stroke, head trauma (44% lower P = 0.076), CNS tumor (22% lower P = 0.174) or MVA (69% lower P = 0.183). A history of diabetes for over 10 years was strongly associated with non-use for DCD lungs (OR, 0.87, P = 0.71), whereas an under 10-year history was associated with increased use (OR 2.33, P = 0.008, OR 1.07 P = 0.819).Lungs from donors ages 40-49 are more likely to be procured than those <30 or >50 in both DBD and DCD. However, likelihood of procurement is 1.84 [95% 1.42, 2.38, p < 0.001] times higher in 40-49-year-old vs. <30-year-old donors when comparing DBD vs. DCD, and 2.43 [95% 1.83, 3.22, p < 0.001] times higher than patients >50 in DBD vs DCD donors. In addition, for each era, the odds for procuring DCD vs. DBD lungs consistently improved [95% 1.46-2.57, p < 0.001].Rejected DCD lungs were associated with donors with higher cardiopulmonary function. Left ventricular ejection fractions in discarded DCD lung donors were higher than those of discarded DBD lung donors (DCD 56.9% ± 13.6 vs. DBD 51.3% ±17.3 P = <0.001). Similar non-use patterns were identified for lung PO2 on 100% O2 (DCD 189.4 ± 121.3 vs. DBD 150.0 ± 106.2 P = <0.001), and when the P/F ratio was above 350.00 (DCD 13.5% vs. DBD 7.7% P = <0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite literature reporting comparable survival of DCD and DBD organs, this study highlights discrepancies in lung procurement practices that evaluate donor characteristics differently in DBD and DCD donors. Further study should investigate whether similar discrepancies exist in the procurement process of other organs.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The association between pretransplant malignancy and post-transplant survival and cancer recurrence in bilateral lung transplantation: An analysis of 23,291 recipients.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Given the increasing need for lung transplants among older patients with a history of cancer, this study analyzed database registry to assess outcomes for bilateral lung transplant (BLT) recipients with pre-transplant malignancy (TM). METHODS: This study evaluated the United Network for Organ Sharing registry for adult BLT performed between 2005 and 2023. Patients with a history of previous or multiorgan transplants, and those with donors who had cancer history, were excluded. Propensity score matching was used to compare patients with or without pre-TM. Overall and post-TM-free survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 23,291 recipients of BLT, 8.0% (1,870) had pre-TM. Compared to those without pre-TM, patients with pre-TM had worse overall (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.29, p < 0.001) and post-TM-free survival (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.24-1.41, p < 0.001). However, after adjusting for age, sex, and race through propensity score matching, the survival difference between the groups became nonsignificant (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.13, p = 0.229). While the pre-TM group still had worse post-TM-free survival, this difference diminished after excluding cutaneous post-TM (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, p = 0.116). Additionally, the recurrence rate of pre-TM after transplant was not higher than de novo cancers in patients without pre-TM. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pre-TM had similar survival rates after BLT as those without pre-TM. Importantly, there was no increased risk of the primary pre-TM type recurring post-transplant compared to patients without pre-TM. If patients with pre-TM are free from recurrence or metastasis for a significant time, there could be some who can benefit from BLT. Further data regarding timeline between pre-TM and BLT would be necessary to draw conclusion in this issue.",

In addition, even patients originally thought to be free of metastasis will present metachronous metastasis in the course of the disease. These patients are considered incurable and current standard of care for metastatic esophageal, gastro-esophageal junction and gastric cancers is a systemic therapy without curative intention. However, patients presenting only a low metastatic load are now defined as oligometastatic disease and should benefit from an aggressive, multimodal therapy. We present here a review of recent publications investigating multimodal therapies for oligometastatic disease and showing that a systemic therapy combined with a resection of the primary tumor together with metastasis is associated with a better prognosis than a systemic therapy alone. We also give a precise focus on esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gastro-esophageal junction and of the stomach. Interestingly, patients with oligometastatic cancer of the esophago-gastric junction can even be treated in curative intention with such a multimodal therapy as we present here in a short case report. In conclusion, new therapeutic strategies including multimodal approaches for oligometastatic disease have shown promising results in the last years and ongoing randomized prospective trials will provide us the evidence to include them in future European guidelines.",

    "AbstractText": "In the Western hemisphere, nonmetastatic locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is mostly treated in multimodal therapy protocols according to current therapy guidelines. In squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, neoadjuvant chemoradiation is the favorable option. Unimodal surgical and chemoradiation treatment alternatives show inferior results on this entity. For locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus perioperative chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiation have been competing treatment approaches in the recent past. Both are evidence based (class I evidence) and superior compared to unimodal surgery. However, the latest results of head-to-head comparative therapy studies show superior overall survival results for the FLOT regimen of perioperative chemotherapy. Furthermore, immunotherapy and targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies have become a strong focus of current clinical research. Nivolumab as well as trastuzumab are already an important part of the current standard therapies. In both entities - SCC and AC - a significant quota of patients shows a locoregional complete remission of the tumor in the specimen after modern neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection. The addition of immunotherapy and targeted therapy to neoadjuvant therapy further increases complete remission rates in defined subgroups according to the results of current studies. Currently, three prospective randomized trials are ongoing on the subject of future possibilities for organ-preserving concepts in case of complete clinical remission (\"surgery as needed,\" \"watch and wait\"). It is to be expected for the future that curative short-term and long-term treatment results in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma will significantly improve, particularly due to the additional possibilities of immunotherapy and organ-preserving therapy concepts in postneoadjuvant complete remission.",

Oncological esophagectomy is a complex procedure associated with a relevant surgical trauma. Complications, such as severe pulmonary infections and anastomotic leakage with mediastinitis lead to a high morbidity rate. To reduce the surgical trauma, the minimally invasive technique was introduced in esophageal surgery. Minimally invasive esophagectomy is associated with less postoperative pain and a reduced rate of pulmonary infections. Currently, there are two major different totally minimally invasive techniques, the conventional laparoscopic/thoracoscopic approach (MIE) and the robotic assisted approach (RAMIE). Both methods require teaching due to the flat learning curve associated with these complex procedures. However, both MIE and RAMIE are performed safely in specialized centers.

Then, compared to normal EPN prostate cells, CEPC treated with EG-VEGF/PROK1 for up to 72 hours demonstrated enhanced cell motility.

    "ArticleTitle": "Plasma Adiponectin Levels in Relation to Chronic Hepatitis B Infection Progression to Liver Cancer Milestones: A Prospective Study.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Our previous nested-case-control study demonstrated elevated adiponectin increased liver cirrhosis and HCC risk in HBV carriers. We extended the analysis to the whole REVEAL-HBV cohort to prospectively evaluate whether adiponectin directly affected end-stage liver diseases, or through affecting HBV progression. METHODS: Baseline plasma adiponectin was determined to investigate the association between adiponectin and subsequent HBeAg, HBsAg, and HBV DNA seroclearance, and the development of cirrhosis, HCC and liver-related death. Whether HBV characteristics modify the adiponectin-milestones associations was also examined. RESULTS: Among 3,931 HBsAg(+)/anti-HCV(-) REVEAL-HBV participants, 3,684 had sufficient biosamples left for adiponectin assay. Elevated adiponectin was associated with a higher chance of HBeAg-seropositive, high HBV viral load (≥2 × 105 IU/mL) and high HBsAg titers (≥1,000 IU/mL) in a dose-response manner (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.55-3.28; OR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.47-3.04; and OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.47-2.52 for Q5 vs. Q1, respectively). Those with the highest quintile had a lower chance of achieving HBeAg (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.27-0.85), HBsAg (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.97), and HBV DNA seroclearance (HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.90) and a higher chance of developing liver cirrhosis (HR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.98-4.20, HCC (HR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.52-3.73), and died from liver-related causes (HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.51-3.54). HBV genotype significantly modified the adiponectin-HCC (Pinteraction = 0.005) and adiponectin-liver death associations (Pinteraction = 0.0157), with higher risk among genotype C. CONCLUSION: Elevated adiponectin is consistently associated with all important chronic HBV infection milestones toward progression to liver cancer. The exact mechanism of how adiponectin mediates HBV infection toward carcinogenesis remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Disentangling this may help us in finding new HBV treatment target, biomarker in HBV surveillance to identify high-risk patients, or even cancer prevention.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the association of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) comorbidity with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and survival. METHODS: We investigated 1,644 patients who underwent hepatic resection for solitary HCC without vascular invasion using computed tomography. Patients were categorized into four groups according to the combination of obesity and DM comorbidities: OB (+) or (-) and DM (+) or (-). Postoperative cumulative recurrence rates within and beyond 2 years and beyond 5 years were assessed. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of reduced recurrence-free survival was 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.33; p = 0.31), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78-1.12; p = 0.48), and 1.24 (95% CI: 1.01-1.54; p = 0.045) in the OB(+)DM(-), OB(-)DM(+), and OB(+)DM(+) groups compared with the OB(-)DM(-) group, respectively. Additionally, the corresponding adjusted HRs of reduced overall survival were 0.93 (p = 0.57), 0.97 (p = 0.76), and 1.38 (p = 0.013) for OB(+)DM(-), OB(-)DM(+), and OB(+)DM(+) groups, respectively. No significant difference in the early recurrence rate was determined among the four groups. The OB(+)DM(+) group demonstrated an increased risk for late recurrence beyond 2 years and 5 years postoperatively compared with the OB(-)DM(-) group (HR: 1.51; p = 0.024 and HR: 2.53; p = 0.046, respectively). The OB(+)DM(-) and OB(-)DM(+) groups demonstrated an increased risk for late recurrence beyond 5 years postoperatively (HR: 3.83; p < 0.001 and HR: 1.95; p = 0.037, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and DM coexistence increased late recurrence and worsened prognosis in patients with HCC undergoing hepatic resection. The results help surgeons develop possible different surveillance protocol and need to focus on diabetes/obesity control during life-long surveillance for patients with HCC.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Malignancy is a long-term complication of lung transplantation (LTx); however, contemporary Australian data and detailed evaluation of nonreportable cancers are lacking. METHODS: Retrospective review of LTx recipients' medical records and registry data linkage were performed to identify histologically proven malignancies. Baseline clinico-demographic variables were collected, and cancer incidence was compared with reported data for the general Australian population. RESULTS: There were 1,715 LTx in 1,631 patients between 1989 and 2021, with a follow-up of 9,696 person-years. Eight hundred and ninety-three (54.8%) patients were male, and the median age at first LTx was 54.7 years. There were 886 deaths with a median overall survival of 7.5 years (95% confidence intervals (CI) 6.8-8.3 years). One thousand seven hundred and seventy-four separate invasive cancer events occurred across 407 patients, of which, 1,588 (89.5%) were nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). This translated to a 9-fold increased incidence of NMSCs and a 4-fold increased incidence of other cancers compared with the general population. Cancer mortality reached parity with chronic lung allograft dysfunction 10 years postfirst transplant and was independently associated with age (hazard ratios (HR) per year increase in age 1.02 [95% CI 1.01-1.03], p = 0.001), Epstein-Barr virus primary mismatch (HR 3.24 [95% CI 1.68-6.25], vs nonmismatch, p = 0.002), and cancer count (HR per cancer event 1.19 [95% CI 1.13-1.24], p < 0.0001), but was not associated with a pretransplant malignancy history. CONCLUSIONS: Our 31-year single-center experience demonstrates that malignancies are a significant mortality burden to long-term LTx survivors, dominated by NMSCs that are poorly reported in cancer datasets. A history of pretransplant malignancy was associated with a shorter time to post-transplant malignancy but was not associated with cancer death.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Medical education is placing increasing importance on interprofessional education, but there are generally limited instances where interprofessional activities are scheduled for both medical and dental students. This study aimed to assess medical and dental trainees' and practitioners' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to interprofessional collaboration on the topic of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). METHODS: Senior medical and dental students, family medicine residents, physicians, and dentists were invited to participate in focus groups to discuss OPC as it relates to their interprofessional collaboration experiences after a networking reception, dinner, and lecture. Focus group audio recordings were transcribed and analysis followed a descriptive qualitative research approach. RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants (n = 9 medical and n = 20 dental) were included across seven focus groups. Participants described structural and educational factors that discouraged collaboration, including communication and referral challenges, a lack of role clarity, and inadequate interprofessional connections. Participants expressed a desire to forge a strong interprofessional alliance through interprofessional education events, improved use of technology for communication, and curricular changes. When these strategies were available, participants perceived significant benefits to patient care. CONCLUSION: Strong collaboration is valued highly among medical and dental professionals for providing patient care, yet interprofessional education is needed to build a foundation that fosters collaborative practices and overcomes barriers. Implementing interprofessional experiences early, regularly, and within the curriculum may improve role clarity and communication, ultimately enhancing care for HPV-OPC patients and other patients.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium is a frequent complication associated with various types of surgery, particularly among older adults. It is thought that postoperative delirium is the result from an imbalance caused by the overproduction of free oxygen radicals. OBJECTIVE: To determine an oxidative stress marker that can predict the onset of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing laparoscopic urological surgery for malignant conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 29 male and female patients who underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic radical surgery for localized kidney cancer between 2021 and 2024. Blood samples were collected at three intervals: before general anesthesia induction, immediately after surgery, and 24 hours postoperatively. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. The occurrence of postoperative delirium was evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). RESULTS: All cases of postoperative delirium emerged within the first seven days after surgery. Out of 29 patients, 11 developed postoperative delirium. Patients in the delirium group exhibited significantly higher malondialdehyde levels at the end of surgery compared to those without delirium (p<0.05). Additionally, superoxide dismutase levels measured before anesthesia induction differed significantly between the delirium and nondelirium groups (p<0.05). Also, glutathione peroxidase (GSH) at the end of surgery significantly decreased in delirium group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The likelihood of developing postoperative delirium in patients undergoing laparoscopic urological surgery for malignant conditions can be anticipated by evaluating oxidative stress markers levels.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rectal cancer remains a global health challenge with significant morbidity and mortality. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is critical for downstaging tumors and improving surgical outcomes. This study aimed to compare the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in evaluating tumor response to NAT in rectal cancer patients, focusing on imaging accuracy and correlation with histopathological findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 201 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer who underwent NAT followed by surgery. Imaging evaluations were conducted pre-NAT and post-NAT using MRI or CT. Tumor responses were categorized into complete response, downstaging, stable disease, and upstaging. Statistical analyses included Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Z-tests to assess differences in imaging performance and concordance with pathological outcomes. RESULTS: Both imaging modalities identified significant downstaging post-NAT, with CT demonstrating a higher sensitivity for detecting complete responses (12.5% vs. 6.61% for MRI) and better local staging accuracy. CT showed superior performance in systemic metastasis detection but had limitations in distinguishing fibrosis from residual tumors. Overall diagnostic accuracy was 42.29%, with MRI having a statistically significant edge in detecting favorable tumor responses (p=0.043). The combined use of CT and MRI provided complementary insights, enhancing clinical decision making. CONCLUSIONS: MRI excels in local tumor evaluation post-NAT, offering detailed imaging crucial for surgical planning and conservative strategies like \"watch-and-wait\" in complete responders. CT remains indispensable for systemic staging and metastasis detection. Integrating both modalities within a standardized protocol can optimize staging accuracy and treatment outcomes in rectal cancer.",

    "AbstractText": "We conducted a retrospective observational study over a 6-year period (2018-2023) on patients aged over 50 with colorectal cancer (CRC), admitted to the Third Department of General Surgery, Clinical Emergency County Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups corresponding to two time periods: 2018-2020 and 2021-2023. The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in the profile of CRC patients over time through a comparative analysis of the two groups in terms of demographic, clinical, and therapeutic parameters. The study revealed a consistent increase in the incidence of CRC cases over the 6 years we analyzed. At the same time, we observed a more favorable profile of patients with CRC over 50 years old in the second group regarding admission type, a higher proportion of cases diagnosed at earlier stages, and a lower complication rate associated with CRC. These factors were reflected in better adherence to oncologic resection principles, a reduction in postoperative complications, and a shorter hospital stay. The direct consequence is an improvement in long-term prognosis and a decrease in the burden on healthcare systems. Furthermore, to tilt the balance towards early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the implementation of a national screening program becomes imperative.",

Alteration of the expression of claudins with a role in the stability of cell adhesion constitutes one of the complex biomolecular mechanisms involved in tumor initiation and progression. In this study, Claudin-4 immunoexpression was investigated in 52 cases of NSCLC in relation to epidemiological and histopathological prognostic parameters of the lesions. Although the staining scores were higher in patients in younger age groups, in women, in smokers and in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and large cell carcinoma (LLC) compared to adenocarcinomas (ADK), the aspects were not statistically significant. We found significantly higher differences in micropapillary, cribriform and solid ADK compared to other histological subtypes, in well and poorly differentiated lesions (G1/G3), with vascular invasion and in advanced tumor stages. Reaction analysis indicated translocation of Claudin-4 signals from the membrane level to the cytoplasm and nucleus in aggressive histological subtypes. The study indicated differences in Claudin-4 expression, which can be used to identify aggressive NSCLC and to stratify patients for specific therapy.",

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of lip diseases and factors associated with its development in peddlers on two beaches of the Guarujá/Brazil coast. Data were collected by clinical examination and use of a questionnaire of 182 peddlers on the beaches. They also received an explanatory folder with information about oral care, and the importance of the use of sunscreen for cancer prevention. All workers diagnosed with lip injuries were referred for dental treatment. The prevalence of lip alterations was 40.7% (n = 70), furthermore, smokers included 27.5%, and alcohol consumption was 20.3%. Regarding selfie protection, 72% of workers reported wearing a hat or cap frequently, 48.4% reported using body sunscreen, and only 11.5% reported using lip balm. There were no significant differences in factors such as alcoholism and smoking related to lip lesions diagnosis. However, when characterizing these factors, 48.6% of those who drink, or smoke have lip alterations. It can be concluded that the population of peddlers on the beaches of Guarujá has a high rate of lip alteration which suggests the need to implement educational health strategies aimed at informing the population about risk factors and preventive measures for lip diseases.",

The study evaluated various methods for EZH2 expression in lip and ear squamous cell carcinomas (LSCC, ESCC) by matching patients with and without lymph node metastasis (LNM) and further analysis of clinical outcome parameters. EZH2 inhibition therapy has shown promising results in multiple cancer entities, with ongoing research exploring its potential in other malignancies. This approach may also be applicable to high-risk LSCC and ESCC. METHODS: A total of 122 patients who had been surgically treated for LSCC and ESCC were selected to form LNM-positive and LNM-negative matched pairs. EZH2 expression has been examined after immunostaining of the tumor tissue with EZH2-antibodies and quantified as extent, intensity, and score. Pursuing the clinical benefit, we analyzed three different EZH2-score approaches to determine aberrations in EZH2 expression. RESULTS: While the overall EZH2 extent did not correlate with clinical outcome, the EZH2-intensity and -score was lower in patients who developed a local relapse or distant metastasis (DM). High EZH2-scores correlated with increasing grading, pN-, and American Joint Committee on Cancer-stage. Overall, the carcinoma tissue samples showed a high expression of EZH2 (mean expression > 60%). CONCLUSION: The hypothesis of the predictive prognostic contribution of EZH2 in clinical decisions regarding the occurrence of LNM was not substantiated by our data. Nevertheless, the elevated expression of EZH2 we have observed in our findings could be utilized as a pretherapeutic assessment prior to targeted therapies with tazemetostat. Subsequent research should substantiate this hypothesis.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Therapies targeting triple-negative breast cancer: a perspective on anti-FGFR.",
    "AbstractText": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the subtypes with the worst prognosis due to tumour heterogeneity and lack of appropriate treatment. This condition is a consequence of the distinctive tumour microenvironment (TME). The TME is associated with factors such as the promotion of proliferation, angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis, suppression of the immune system and drug resistance. Therefore, remodelling the TME is critical for the treatment of TNBC. A key role in the formation of the TME is played by the fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast growth factor receptor(FGF/FGFR) signalling pathway. Thus, the FGFRs may be a potential target for treating TNBC. Over-activated FGFRs promote growth, migration and drug resistance in TNBC by influencing the onset of TME events, tumour angiogenesis and immune rejection. A thorough comprehension of the FGF/FGFR signalling pathway's mechanism of action in the development of TNBC could offer valuable insights for discovering new therapeutic strategies and drug targets. Inhibiting the FGF/FGFR axis could potentially hinder the growth of TNBC and its drug resistance by disrupting crucial biological processes in the TME, such as angiogenesis and immune evasion. This review evaluates the potential of inhibiting the FGF/FGFR axis as a strategy for treating TNBC. It explores the prospects for developing related therapeutic approaches. This study explores the research and application prospects of the FGF/FGFR axis in TNBC. The aim is to provide guidance for further therapeutic research and facilitate the development of innovative approaches targeting TNBC.",

This study aims to describe and identify risk factors for the occurrence and/or exacerbation of vertebral fractures (vertebral fracture progression) during immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective, monocentric study. We collected data on melanoma and NSCLC patients, treated with first-line ICIs at the Medical Oncology Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia, between January 2015 and November 2021, and with a median follow-up of 20.1 (6-36) months. We collected data on patients, diseases, immune-related adverse events, and cortico-steroid therapy initiated on concomitant ICIs. RESULTS: We identified 135 patients, 65 (48.2 %) with locally advanced/metastatic melanoma and 70 (51.8 %) with locally advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Twenty-one (15.6 %) patients already had an asymptomatic vertebral fracture at baseline before starting ICIs in monotherapy. A total of ten patients, or 7.4 %, had a vertebra fracture progression defined as a new vertebral fracture or a worsening of a previous fracture. There was a strong relation between the steroid therapy and irAEs with vertebra fracture progression [OR (95 % CI) 8.1 (3.7-17.8) p-value < 0.001] in univariable analysis. However, only steroid therapy resulted to be an independent risk factor [8.260 (95 % CI 0.909-75.095); p-value 0.061] at the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Concurrent steroid therapy in patients receiving immunotherapy exposes them to a high risk of fractures due to skeletal fragility.

We evaluated the presence of 14-3-3eta as a diagnostic biomarker in the evaluation IA. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients who were evaluated for IA by a rheumatologist with a result for the lab test of 14-3-3eta was conducted. RESULTS: Of 280 included patients, 30% were diagnosed with RA, 11% with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 59% with another condition. Twenty-four (9%) patients had positive results for 14-3-3eta. Fifty-two percent of positive patients were diagnosed with RA, with 48% having another diagnosis including axial spondyloarthritis, gout, Sjögren's, undifferentiated IA, diabetic cheiroarthropathy, prostate cancer with bone metastasis, osteoarthritis, unspecified arthralgia. No patients with PsA had a positive value. RA patients had a higher value for 14-3-3eta compared to non-RA (5.44 [1.56~9.31] vs. 0.69 [0.40~0.98] ng/mL, p=0.03, square brackets are 95% confidence interval values).

While there are several data regarding chemotherapy intensification, actually, no reliable data directly comparing different radiotherapy (RT) dose levels are available. The present study aimed to compare intensified RT versus standard dose in patients with LARC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 12 centers were collected for the current large retrospective study. The primary end-point evaluated whether RT dose intensification was associated with an increased pathological complete response (pCR). The secondary end-points explored the relation between RT dose and interval to surgery, downstaging, and RT-related toxicity. Subgroup analysis according to primary tumor stage was also performed. RESULTS: 1028 patients were analysed. All patients received combined RCHT with (364) or without (664) a RT boost. Patients underwent surgery after a median 10 weeks (IQ range 5-28). The overall pCR rate was 21.5 %. In the boost and no-boost groups, the pCR was 26.6 % (97) and 17 % (114) (p = 0.00), respectively. As a subgroup analysis, the pCR stratified by interval to surgery was 10 %, 23 %, 26.3 %, and 39.3 % (p < 0.000) in the boost group versus 10.6 %, 20.8 %, 19.3 %, and 20.4 % (p = 0.018) in the no-boost group. cT3 patients operated on ≥ week 11 and cT4 patients, regardless of time to surgery, received a significant benefit by the RT boost in terms of pCR rate. Patients in the boost group had a higher rate of grade ≥ 3 acute gastrointestinal toxicities (6 % vs. 1.7 %; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that RT dose intensification (boost) in LARC might significantly increase the pCR rate, although with a small increase in acute toxicity. While pCR seems only partially improved by prolonged time to surgery in the no-boost group, a progressive and significant pCR improvement in patients treated with boost over time was observed. RT boost seems to be beneficial only in more advanced primary tumors.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Understanding the mechanisms underlying endometrial cancer progression is crucial for the development of effective targeted therapies. In this study, we investigated the role of MTFR2 in endometrial cancer cell. METHODS: The expression of MTFR2 in endometrial cancer was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and detected in endometrial cancer tissues and cells, respectively. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were utilized to investigate the impact of MTFR2 on endometrial cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Computational tools were employed to predict microRNAs (miRNAs) that potentially regulate MTFR2, and these predictions were experimentally validated. RESULTS: The expression of MTFR2 is enhanced in endometrial carcinoma, and it is positively correlated with the poor prognosis of patients. Functional studies show that MTFR2 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays identified that MTFR2 is a potential target of miR-132-3p, and transfection with miR-132-3p mimics attenuated the MTFR2-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the critical role of MTFR2 in promoting endometrial cancer cell proliferation and growth through the miR-132-3p/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Targeting this signaling axis may offer potential therapeutic strategies for endometrial cancer treatment.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A Practical Format to Organize Cancer Constellations Using Innate Immune System Biomarkers: Implications for Early Diagnosis and Prognostication.",
    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: Cancer discovery is directed at the identification of a specific cancer type which allows for specific therapeutic interventions. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recently, similar immune checkpoint therapeutics have been applied with success across several cancer types, opening the field for other immune disruptive interventions that have practical applications. METHODS: We have discovered an innate immune system (InImS) biomarker that allows for the characterization of allied cancer subtypes and outliers that might aid with diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication. RESULTS: These InImS biomarkers are related to PD-L1 treatment outcomes and can be potentially manipulated by dietary means. CONCLUSIONS: The FERAD (ferritin-fecal p87) and absolute neutrophil/lymphocyte (aNLR) ratios are two such InImS biomarkers and we show herein, that they allow for the discovery of diagnosis and prognostication patterns, as demonstrated by this study.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The Evolution of Patient Advocacy: From Rights to Reality.",
    "AbstractText": "Fifty years ago, George J. Annas and Joseph Healey introduced the concept of a \"patient rights advocate\" in their seminal 1974 article published in the Vanderbilt Law Review. Annas expanded this vision in the ACLU Handbook, The Rights of Hospitalized Patients, later broadening its scope to all medical settings. This essay traces the evolution of patient advocacy, highlighting pivotal milestones: the advent of cancer navigators, the rise of the patient safety movement, the establishment of patient advocacy organizations, the development of Patient Advocate Offices in hospitals, and the emergence of independent advocates with board certification. It also examines the impact of advocacy on healthcare outcomes, costs, and patient-provider satisfaction, and explores future directions for this vital and growing profession.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Breast cancer epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Moroccan women: a six-year retrospective study.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in Morocco, with 11,747 new cases reported in 2020. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological and clinical aspects of breast cancer in Moroccan women. METHODS: this retrospective study included all female breast cancer patients diagnosed at the Reference Center for Reproductive Health in Kenitra from 2013 to 2018. A detailed analysis of the patients´ medical records was conducted in this study. RESULTS: the study included 973 female participants. The mean age of the patients was 51.1 ± 12.3 years (range, 18-95 years). Notably, 65.1% of the participants were from urban areas. The median diagnosis delay was 8 days. Over half (53.3%) of the women were postmenopausal, with a mean age at menopause of 50.3 ± 4 years. The mean age at first pregnancy was 23.9 ± 6.8 years, ranging from 12 to 47 years. Fifty-four percent of the women used hormonal contraceptives, primarily oral pills. During clinical examination, breast nodules were the most prevalent presenting sign in the sampled women, with nodules typically found to be fixed in 89% of cases in the right breast and 91% in the left breast. CONCLUSION: the study revealed significant concerns regarding women diagnosed at the Reference Center for Reproductive Health in Kenitra, such as prolonged diagnosis delays, advanced age at menopause, and a considerable prevalence of nodules and palpable axillary adenopathy.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Applicability of indocyanine green fluorescence tracing with subserosal dye injection in laparoscopic lymph node dissection for gastric cancer: a preliminary study.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is a common malignancy of the digestive system, primarily metastasizing to the lymph nodes. Adequate lymph node dissection is crucial for accurate staging and improving patient prognosis. However, the complex distribution of lymph nodes around the stomach poses a significant challenge for thorough dissection. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic radical gastrectomy guided by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging with subserosal ICG injection in lymph node dissection for gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 20 patients who underwent distal gastrectomy at the Wenzhou People's Hospital between January 2020 and December 2022. Of them, 10 patients underwent conventional laparoscopic surgery, and the other 10 underwent laparoscopic surgery guided by ICG fluorescence imaging. The 2 groups were propensity-matched for sex, age, and preoperative cancer stage. General patient characteristics, lymph node dissection data, and perioperative outcomes, such as procedure time, blood loss, and postoperative complications, were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The total number of dissected lymph nodes was higher in the fluorescence-guided group than in the conventional surgery group, particularly in stations No. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11p (all P <⁠0.001). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of procedure time, blood loss, and the incidence of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study demonstrates that the use of ICG fluorescence imaging in minimally invasive radical gastrectomy can significantly increase the number of dissected lymph nodes without increasing the surgical risk.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Effects of bronchoscopic alveolar lavage-assisted mechanical ventilation on postoperative pulmonary infection and inflammatory factors in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Patients undergoing lung cancer (LC) surgery often develop pulmonary infection (PI) due to poor sputum excretion ability leading to accumulation of secretions. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be used to clear respiratory secretions and serve as a vehicle to locally deliver antibiotics that fight infection. AIM: This study explored the clinical efficacy of BAL‑assisted mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with postoperative PI and its influence on inflammatory parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 90 LC patients with postoperative PI were enrolled and divided into an MV group (n = 45) and a BAL‑assisted MV group (n = 45). Therapeutic effects, respiratory mechanics, lung function parameters, blood gas indices, and levels of inflammatory parameters in peripheral blood were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In comparison with the MV group, the PI control time, MV duration, temperature recovery time, and Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score of patients in the BAL‑assisted MV group were greatly reduced. In both groups, airway resistance, peak airway pressure, and work of breathing decreased, while lung compliance increased. Maximum minute ventilation, total lung capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and maximum mid‑expiratory flow were substantially enhanced following each treatment. In addition, post‑treatment arterial oxygen pressure and saturation, pH value, and the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the fraction of inspiratory oxygen concentration increased, while partial pressure of carbon dioxide decreased in both groups. The levels of inflammatory markers (high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein, procalcitonin, tumor necrosis factor α, high‑mobility group box 1, interleukin 6, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α) in peripheral blood were decreased regardless of the treatment method (all P <0.05). All these findings were more pronounced in the BAL‑assisted MV group. Clinical effective rate in the BAL‑assisted MV group was higher than in the MV group (93.33% vs 77.78%; P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BAL‑assisted MV can achieve better results in treating postoperative PI than MV alone, effectively improving respiratory function and reducing systemic inflammatory response.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Novel robot-assisted minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of esophageal cancer.",
    "AbstractText": "A new trend toward the application robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has started to develop in the field of gastrointestinal tract surgery. As compared with the current gold standard, minimally invasive esophagectomy, RAMIE facilitates more thorough upper mediastinal lymphadenectomy and reduces the risk of vessel damage. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of RAMIE in patients with esophageal cancer based on the first 2 RAMIE procedures carried out in Poland. Both robotic procedures were successful, without the need for conversion to open surgery. There was no case of incomplete lesion removal or postoperative complications, indicating that RAMIE is a feasible and safe treatment option for patients with esophageal cancer and results in good postoperative recovery.",
