    "ArticleTitle": "Deep learning assessment of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus in Hakim's disease or idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) is a key feature of Hakim's disease (synonymous with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; iNPH). However, it previously had been only subjectively evaluated. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of MRI indices, derived from deep learning segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, for DESH detection and to establish their optimal thresholds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled a total of 1009 participants, including 77 patients diagnosed with Hakim's disease, 380 healthy volunteers, 163 with mild cognitive impairment, 256 with Alzheimer's disease, and 217 with other types of neurodegenerative diseases. DESH, ventriculomegaly, tightened sulci in the high convexities, and Sylvian fissure dilatation were evaluated on three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI by radiologists. The total ventricles, high-convexity part of the subarachnoid space, and Sylvian fissure and basal cistern were automatically segmented using the CSF Space Analysis application (FUJIFILM Corporation). Moreover, DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices were calculated based on these 3 regions. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of these indices and region volumes (volume ratios) for DESH detection were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 1009 participants, 101 (10%) presented with DESH. The DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices performed well with 95.0%-96.0% sensitivity and 91.5%-96.8% specificity at optimal thresholds. All patients with Hakim's disease were diagnosed with DESH, despite variations in severity. In patients with Hakim's disease, with or without Alzheimer's disease, the DESH index and total ventricular volume were significantly higher compared to patients with Alzheimer's disease, although the total intracranial cerebrospinal fluid volume was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: DESH, Venthi, and Sylhi indices, and the volumes and volume ratios of the ventricle and high-convexity part of the subarachnoid space computed using deep learning were useful for the DESH detection that may help to improve the diagnosis of Hakim's disease (ie, iNPH).",

    "ArticleTitle": "Beyond stroke therapy, neuroaid (a chinese herbal) has an effect on cognition and neurogenesis, a bibliometric study.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: NeuroAiD, also known as MLC601 or MLC901, is a Chinese herbal combination used worldwide for stroke treatment. It contains herbal components and five hewan components. MLC601 contains herbal components and hewan components, while MLC901 has a similar herbal composition. NeuroAiD is used to support neurologic recovery after stroke and to aid cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease. Studies show that NeuroAiD has potential in treating Alzheimer's disease and is beneficial in both local and global stroke models and in the Kortikal culture. However, there is limited bibliometric research on NeuroAiD, which is a method of collecting data from published articles to analyze developments and trends in the field of research. This research contributes significantly to the literature and helps develop more effective stroke treatment strategies. METHODS: In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroaid. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, topic dendogram, and world cloud. CONCLUSIONS: The study investigates the potential of Neuroaid, a neuroprotective drug, for stroke prevention and cognitive function enhancement. It uses terms like \"cognition\" and \"neurogenesis\" to highlight its potential. While the study's focus may be limited, it provides valuable insights into research direction and potential areas of neuroaid for stroke treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "Superficial white matter (SWM) U-fibers contain considerable structural connectivity in the human brain; however, related studies are not well-developed compared to the well-studied deep white matter (DWM). Conventionally, SWM U-fiber is obtained through DWM tracking, which is inaccurate on the cortical surface. The significant variability in the cortical folding patterns of the human brain renders a conventional template-based atlas unsuitable for accurately mapping U-fibers within the thin layer of SWM beneath the cortical surface. Recently, new surface-based tracking methods have been developed to reconstruct more complete and reliable U-fibers. To leverage surface-based U-fiber tracking methods, we propose to create a surface-based U-fiber dictionary using high-resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We first identify the major U-fiber bundles and then build a dictionary containing subjects with high groupwise consistency of major U-fiber bundles. Finally, we propose a shape-informed U-fiber atlasing method for robust SWM connectivity analysis. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our shape-informed atlasing method can obtain anatomically more accurate U-fiber representations than state-of-the-art atlas. Additionally, our method is capable of restoring incomplete U-fibers in low-resolution dMRI, thus helping better characterize SWM connectivity in clinical studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).",

    "AbstractText": "Cholesterol, produced by astrocytes, is vital for the formation and maintenance of synapse, highlighting the significance of lipid metabolism in neuronal health. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are versatile, self-renewing and capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, playing a pivotal role in both embryonic development and adult neurogenesis. In the central nervous system (CNS), NSCs primarily reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the sub-granular layer of the dentate gyrus, where they give rise to neural progenitors and subsequently to neurons and glial cells. Oligodendrocytes play a crucial role in the CNS function and myelin sheath formation, which is essential for rapid neuronal signal transmission. Astrocytes contribute to brain homeostasis by regulating lipid metabolism and providing metabolic support to neurons. Sphingolipids and phospholipids are integral to neural cell membrane structure and function, influencing processes such as neurogenesis, cell signaling, and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the ApoE4 allele impacts lipid metabolism, affecting the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. This paper explores the role of various cell types and lipids in the CNS, emphasizing the importance of lipid metabolism in maintaining neural function and the implications for neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "AbstractText": "Tau, an intrinsically disordered protein associated with microtubule stabilization, is crucial for cellular trafficking, and signaling pathways. Under pathological conditions, Tau undergoes post-translational modifications and structural changes, leading to its aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The interactions between Tau and membrane lipids, including phospholipids like DOPC, DPPC, and proteins such as Apo E4, play a significant role in Tau aggregation. These interactions modulate Tau's structure, stabilization, and aggregation kinetics. Phospholipase C (PLC) and DEPC also influence Tau aggregation through signaling pathways and preservation of RNA integrity, respectively. Membrane lipid composition affects Tau-membrane interactions, which can promote Tau fibrillization and propagation, contributing to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other Tauopathies. The disruption of lipid homeostasis by Apo E4, alterations in membrane fluidity and integrity by DPPC, and the influence of phospholipids on BBB functionality are significant in understanding Tau pathology.",

    "AbstractText": "Tau protein accumulation is one of the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their accumulation is driven by the formation of intermediate toxic oligomers of Tau to the highly ordered neurofibrillary tangles. Cellular machineries engage different types of proteins such as, chaperone-co-chaperones complex, ubiquitin, kinases, proteases etc., to clear the aberrantly accumulated Tau protein which otherwise would cause neuronal death. In the milieu of proteotoxicity, it would be significant for the cell to follow a specific path for Tau clearance. Under this circumstance, cells express key proteins and other accessory proteins specific to the pathway. This is known to be dependent on the post-translational modifications and mutations associated with Tau. The processes involved maintenance of proteins homeostasis in cells collectively called proteostasis. The proteostasis involve the synthesis of proteins by ribosomes, protein folding mostly by chaperons and the degradation of improperly folded or unwanted proteins. Autophagy is the mechanism to eradicate unwanted, non-functional and toxic proteins from the cell. Proteostasis plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal cellular environment in the expense of considerable amount of energy.

    "AbstractText": "The pathophysiological scenario of Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes the misfolding and mis-sorting of two cellular proteins: Amyloid-β as plaques and microtubule-associated protein Tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The protein oligomers are the short-lived but, highly reactive species which mediate toxicity, synaptic loss, neurodegeneration and ultimately cognitive decline. Tau oligomers can propagate through various pathway viz. the exosomal pathway, neurotransmission, cell-to-cell junction, bulk endocytosis and receptor-mediated internalization etc. The preparation, isolation and detection of oligomers were of immense importance in the current field for designing therapeutics and diagnostics. Microglia are the prime immune cells in brain which maintain the homeostasis via synaptic surveillance and tissue-remodeling. But, the senescent microglia mediate pro-inflammation, oxidative damage and phagocytosis in diseased brain. The extracellular Tau oligomers were found to interact with microglial purinergic receptor P2Y12 which then led to microglial migration, activation and phagocytosis via various remodeled actin structure. P2Y12 receptor mediates Tau oligomers-induced microglial chemotaxis by localizing with migratory actin structures such as- filopodia, lamellipodia, podosome etc. These beneficial roles of P2Y12 in microglial chemotaxis, actin remodeling and Tau clearance can be intervened as a therapeutic target in AD.",

AD is histopathologically characterized by two hallmarks: intracellular accumulation of Tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular deposition of amyloid beta. In this book chapter, we highlighted the microtubule-associated protein Tau, exploring its structural diversity and its distinct isoforms. It is an intrinsically disordered protein which lacks three-dimensional structure that are defined by their vast structural segments that undergo rapid and prolonged conformational alterations. It has not been possible to analyze the structure of disordered proteins since they often have different conformations and are very flexible. Tau proteins comprise various domains that significantly participate in physiology in neurons, including stabilizing microtubule structure and dynamics and axonal cargo transport. In its physiological state, Tau interacts with various molecules and proteins. By various post-translational modifications at specific sites in Tau protein, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation. Tau protein undergo pathological structural confirmation by hyperphosphorylation, forming insoluble oligomers, and developing as paired helical filaments.

Highly branched polymers, dendrimers were also seen to be effective Tau and AD therapeutics as drug-delivery systems and on their own. Metal complexes and metal nanoparticles also showed success against AD. Synthesis of a bifunctional compound that was an effective chelating agent for Cu, useful against Tau and Amyloid-β (Aβ) and was catalysed by excess Cu metal present in association with Aβ was also done.

This paper aims to tackle a situation when precisely labeled samples are limited in the training set due to cost or availability constraints, whereas there could be an abundance of samples with imprecise labels. We focus on imprecise labels that are intervals, i.e., one can know that the a sample belongs to an interval of labels but cannot know which unique label it has. This situation is quite common in health care datasets due to limitations of the diagnostic instrument, sparse clinical visits, or/and patient dropout. Limited research has been done to develop OL models with imprecise/interval labels. We propose a new Hybrid Ordinal Learner (HOL) to integrate samples with both precise and interval labels to train a robust OL model. We also develop a tractable and efficient optimization algorithm to solve the HOL formulation. We compare HOL with several recently developed OL methods on four benchmarking datasets, which demonstrate the superior performance of HOL. Finally, we apply HOL to a real-world dataset for predicting the speed of progressing to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on a combination of multi-modality neuroimaging and demographic/clinical datasets. HOL achieves high accuracy in the prediction and outperforms existing methods. The capability of accurately predicting the speed of progression to AD for each individual with MCI has the potential for helping facilitate more individually-optimized interventional strategies.",

MedGraphNet initializes nodes using informative embeddings from existing text knowledge, allowing for robust integration of various data types and improved generalizability. Our results demonstrate that MedGraphNet matches and often outperforms traditional single-relation approaches, particularly in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes. The model shows generalizability to external datasets, achieving high accuracy in identifying disease-gene associations and drug-phenotype relationships. Notably, MedGraphNet accurately inferred drug side effects without direct training on such data. Using Alzheimer's disease as a case study, MedGraphNet successfully identified relevant phenotypes, genes, and drugs, corroborated by existing literature.

    "AbstractText": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), once recognized as a harmful gas, is now emerging as a very significant biological substance with great emphasis on neuroprotection and neuromodulation. It has several functions within the nervous system, placing its physiological activities, biochemical characteristics as well as therapeutic possibilities to their proper perspective. Endogenously produced by cystathione beta-synthase (CBS), cystathione gamma-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) enzymes, H2S is a unique naturally occurring substance that contains multiple biological activities; it is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic. Such activity allows H2S to reduce oxidative stress, which limits mechanisms of cell death and prevents disruption of mitochondria and thus neuronal injury. H2S can also be regarded as a neuromodulator because it interacts with and affects the glutamatergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic systems at the synaptic level as well as on neurotransmitter systems and synapse dynamics. It modulates synaptic transmission and its plasticity which is essential for cognitive as well as motor activities and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects which are helpful in the progress of the neurodegenerative condition. Recently gathered some evidence emphasizes as well the possible use of H2S in therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. In the models of Alzheimer's disease, H2S is able to reduce the toxicity of amyloid-beta peptides and improve cognitive performance. In Parkinson's disease, it protects dopaminergic neurons and reduces the severity of motor deficits. Moreover, H2S provides protection in ischemic stroke models through decrease of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Clinical practice with H2S-based therapies seems to have certain hurdles even if preclinical results are promising. Aside from stabilizing H2S in a biologically active form, developing a delivery system for H2S appears a challenge as well. This review will attempt to summarize the existing studies on H2S as neuroprotective and neuromodulatory agents, and their avenues of future use and development.",

This study included 30 DS cases (13-18 years old) with full trisomy 21 in addition to 30 healthy age-matched controls. The cognitive decline in DS subjects was evaluated using the short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE). Serum levels of APL1b25, ALP1b27, ALP1b28 and MHPG were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results indicated a significant positive correlation (P = 0.045) between IQCODE short score and APL1b25 serum level in DS patients. Also the present data recorded a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in APL1b25, APL1b27, APL1b28 and MHPG serum levels in DS patients contrary to the controls. Our findings confirm the impaired metabolism of APL1 peptides and the degeneration of noradrenergic neurons in DS patients which ultimately leads to early onset of AD.

    "ArticleTitle": "Examining the Performance of Polygenic Risk Scores for Alzheimer Disease Within and Across Populations Using k-Fold Cross-Validation.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) has a complex etiology with a strong genetic component. Despite mounting evidence that genetic risk effect sizes vary by population, most research on the genetics of AD has examined only data sets of individuals with European ancestry. In this study, we investigate the variable performance and transferability of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) by deriving a PRS from analyses of AD for various race and ethnic categories and applying this across groups using a k-fold cross-validation approach. METHODS: After quality control and application of inclusion criteria, we analyzed 11,254 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Release 3 with 3 predominant self-identified race/ethnicity groups: Hispanic individuals (n = 2,207), non-Hispanic Black individuals (n = 2,437), and non-Hispanic White individuals (n = 6,610). For each group, a 5-fold cross-validation approach was used to perform a genome-wide association study (training) and construct PRS estimates (test). This approach allowed for consideration of within-group and across-group PRS performance. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each race/ethnicity-specific PRS within each cross-validation fold. Various PRS criteria were considered, including rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the APOE region in calculation, sex-specific PRSs, and different sample sizes of training and test groups, and their effects were examined through goodness-of-fit metrics in reduced and full models. RESULTS: Across all participant groups, the PRS trained in the same race/ethnicity category as the test group nearly exclusively outperformed the other PRSs with considerable benefit in the Hispanic group. The range of AUCs across iterations was also greater when applying PRSs from other groups. These findings were consistent after inclusion of APOE, sex, and age covariates and through different PRS generation criteria. DISCUSSION: In this study, we demonstrated the variable performance of AD PRSs within race/ethnicity groups and the weakness in transferability across groups, accounting for different criteria in PRS calculation. This work provided a framework for improving PRS application for AD and highlighted the importance of recruiting diverse populations in genetic studies.",

    "AbstractText": "Psychotropics are currently developed and marketed with a limited understanding of their mechanism of action. The notion that protein kinase C (PKC) activity is highly relevant to learning and memory function stems from experiments in the 1980s, which associated protein kinase alpha (pka) and pkc to animal models of associative learning, opening an area of exploration for psychotropic development. The PKC family consists of several isoforms, including PKC alpha, beta1, beta1, gamma, delta and epsilon among others. In particular, PKC gamma (PRKCG) is highly brain-expressed and is singled out as a candidate for modulation in psychiatric illness. With hundreds of identified substrates, PRKCG affects multiple pathways relevant for regulation of neuronal health. In this review, converging lines of evidence are presented in the context of psychotropic drug action, which point to downregulation of PKC activity as a potential common mechanism across several psychiatric disorders. Using this mechanism through more targeted psychotropic action may then be used to develop agents that further ameliorate psychiatric symptom expression. Psychotropics including fluoxetine, tricyclics, lithium, valproate, ketamine and others are explored in relation to their effect of PKC, finding that across all drugs examined, a downregulation with chronic-but not acute-use constitutes their putative effect in ameliorating symptoms. This effect is compounded by findings that suggest that PKCs, and PRKCG in particular, promote neuroplastic effects by their downregulation. This effect is in contrast to PKC activators, which have been used in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Cross-disorder mechanisms need to continue to be explored in neuropsychiatric illness and targeted treatments developed in turn to address treatment-resistant conditions.",

However, the exact nature of AD's relationship with white matter anatomical deterioration is not fully understood at a systemic level. To investigate this knowledge gap, we constructed structural brain networks from ADNI-GO/2 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images with brain regions of interest (ROIs) as nodes and white matter connections as edges weighted by fiber density. The cohort consists of healthy control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and clinically diagnosed AD subjects. By optimizing consensus modularity of structural brain networks at a subpopulation level to investigate community structure throughout a range of resolution parameters (γ), we observed a split of the reward-based decision-making module in the AD group at γ = 1.3, thus finding a 7th consensus community in the AD consensus brain network partition that was not present in that of MCI or HC populations. Upon further investigation, we found that thalamic and caudal regions were involved in the increased segregation of AD brain networks. These regions are implicated in regulation of decision-making processes, and their segregation from other decision-making regions is a novel finding in white matter biomarker studies of AD. Our study presents novel evidence that AD may be a disconnection syndrome at the mesoscopic structural level, with potential new avenues of exploration into the role of the thalamus and caudate that may reveal neural correlates of cognitive deficits in clinically diagnosed AD.",

Age, a critical risk factor for AD, is typically assessed by comparing physiological and estimated brain ages. This study utilizes mouse models expressing human alleles of APOE and human nitric oxide synthase 2 (hNOS2), replicating genetic risks for AD alongside a human-like immune response. We developed a multivariate model that incorporates brain structural connectomes, APOE genotypes, demographic traits (age and sex), environmental factors such as diet, and behavioral data to estimate brain age. Our methodology employs a Feature Attention Graph Neural Network (FAGNN) to integrate these diverse datasets. Behavioral data are processed using a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN), demographic traits via a 1D CNN, and brain connectomes through a graph neural network equipped with a quadrant attention module that accentuates critical neural connections. The FAGNN model demonstrated a mean absolute error in age prediction of 31.85 days and a root mean squared error of 41.84 days, significantly outperforming simpler models. Our analysis further focused on the brain age delta, which assesses accelerated or delayed aging by comparing brain age, predicted by FAGNN, to the chronological age. A high-fat diet and the presence of the humanNOS2gene were identified as significant accelerators of brain aging in the old age group. Key neural connections identified by FAGNN, such as those between the cingulum, corpus callosum, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and piriform cortex, were found to be significant in the aging process. Validation using diffusion MRI-based metrics, including fractional anisotropy and return-to-origin probability measures across these connections, revealed significant age-related differences. These findings suggest that white matter degradation in the connections highlighted by FAGNN plays a key role in aging. Our findings suggest that the complex interplay of APOE genotype with sex, immunity, and environmental factors modulates brain aging and enhance our understanding of AD risk in mouse models of aging.",

While previous studies have hinted at the potential neuroplastic benefits of musical engagement and training, the mechanisms through which music impacts structural connectivity in neurodegenerative pathways remain underexplored. We aimed to examine the impact of music perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity in areas relating to memory, emotion, and learning in individuals with worsening memory impairment, investigating the potential neuroplastic effects of music. Employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based structural connectivity and graph theoretical analysis, we investigated brain topological features in 78 participants aged 42 to 85 with a range of memory impairments. Participants were assessed for musical training, engagement, and perception skills. The study analyzed regional and local network topological metrics to examine the influence of musical activities on graph metrics, while controlling for stages of objective memory impairment (SOMI) and diagnosis, separately. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of musical perception skills, active musical engagement, and musical training on structural connectivity within memory, emotion, and learning-related brain areas in individuals with varying degrees of memory impairment. We found enhanced structural connectivity of the right hippocampus and the right posterior cingulate cortex was associated with stronger local network metrics, such as clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality, with increased music perception skills like melody and beat perception. Musical training specifically impacted the clustering coefficient of the right hippocampus and the node degree of the right mid cingulate gyrus. Active musical engagement influenced the eigenvector centrality of the right hippocampus. Furthermore, musical training was associated with enhanced global metrics, such as global efficiency and characteristic path length. Our study integrates diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and graph theoretical analysis to reveal significant effects of musical activities on structural connectivity in key brain regions. The results highlight the potential of musical activities to serve as a non-invasive modulatory tool for cognitive resilience, especially in memory impairment and neurodegeneration contexts. These insights contribute to the understanding of delaying AD onset and aiding early-stage patients through music-based interventions, emphasizing the importance of musical engagement in maintaining cognitive and brain health.",

    "AbstractText": "[18F]PI-2620 is a second generation tracer that has shown high binding affinity for tau aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, [18F]PI-2620 signal in a large sample spanning the healthy aging and AD clinical spectrum as well as the stability of signal across different acquisition time windows has not yet been examined. Here, amyloid negative (Aβ-) cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 49), amyloid positive (Aβ+) CU (n = 37), CU individuals with unknown amyloid status (n = 5), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 14), dementia due to AD (n = 19), and non-AD neurodegenerative disorder (n = 54) participants were scanned with [18F]PI-2620 using a 45-75 min and/or 60-90 min acquisition time window. The impact of acquisition time on standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) magnitude was first quantified with linear mixed models, and in participants and regions with high [18F]PI-2620 signal, SUVRs increased linearly up to 0.04 SUVR with each additional 5 min past injection time. We then accounted for differences in acquisition time using a voxel-wise correction approach and showed high correlations (allr's ≥ 0.986) between SUVRs calculated from 45-75 min data and SUVRs from 60-90 min data that were interpolated to the 45-75 min scale in 15 participants who were scanned across both time windows. Using real and interpolated 45-75 min data, we next examined [18F]PI-2620 signal in Braak regions of interest and an off-target binding region (putamen) in Aβ- and Aβ+ CU, Aβ+ MCI, and Aβ+ AD dementia (n = 115) and showed that SUVRs in all Braak regions increased with greater disease severity. Within CU, higher Braak I SUVR was significantly associated with greater CSF pTau-181 (n = 35), and higher SUVRs were significantly associated with worse memory and language (n = 57). Thus, voxel-wise acquisition time corrections can be applied to combine [18F]PI-2620 datasets collected at different post-injection times, and once acquisition time is accounted for, [18F]PI-2620 signal shows the expected increases across the AD spectrum and can be used for detection of early tau elevations.",

    "AbstractText": "Longitudinal assessment of brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus, is a well-studied biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Estimating brain progression patterns can be applied to understanding the therapeutic effects of amyloid-clearing drugs in research and detecting the earliest sign of accelerated atrophy in clinical settings. However, most state-of-the-art measurements calculate changes directly by segmentation and/or deformable registration of MRI images, and may misreport head motion or MRI artifacts as neurodegeneration, impacting their accuracy. In our previous study, we developed a deep learning method DeepAtrophy that uses a convolutional neural network to quantify differences between longitudinal MRI scan pairs that are associated with time. DeepAtrophy has high accuracy in inferring temporal information from longitudinal MRI scans, such as temporal order or relative interscan interval. DeepAtrophy also provides an overall atrophy score that was shown to perform well as a potential biomarker of disease progression and treatment efficacy. However, DeepAtrophy is not interpretable, and it is unclear what changes in the MRI contribute to progression measurements. In this paper, we propose Regional Deep Atrophy (RDA), which combines the temporal inference approach from DeepAtrophy with a deformable registration neural network and attention mechanism that highlights regions in the MRI image where longitudinal changes are contributing to temporal inference. RDA has similar prediction accuracy as DeepAtrophy, but its additional interpretability makes it more acceptable for use in clinical settings, and may lead to more sensitive biomarkers for disease monitoring and progression understanding in preclinical AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is becoming increasingly common to assessin vivotau burden. MR images are often acquired to assist with processing of PET data, including for region-of-interest definitions in native space and for normalization to template space. However, in the real-world setting, corresponding MRIs may not be available and PET processing may require MRI-free pipelines. This is particularly important and challenging as the field moves towards early detection among clinically unimpaired (CU) individuals where changes in tau PET signal are expected to be subtle. We used two independent [18F]Flortaucipir tau PET datasets to evaluate whether MRI-free PET processing can detect subtle tau PET uptake differences in Amyloid+ (A+) CU individuals (preclinical AD) versus A-. Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVRs) from MRI-free compared to MRI-based methods were evaluated using linear regression and linear mixed-effects regression models. Effect size differences between A+/- CU groups in MRI-free processed cross-sectional and longitudinal tau PET SUVRs were compared to differences quantified through MRI-based processing. Regional MRI-free SUVRs were highly correlated with MRI-based SUVRs within CU individuals (average ICC = 0.90 for ADNI CU and 0.81 for A4 CU). MRI-free and MRI-based pipelines resulted in similar estimates of cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between A- and A+ CU, even in early focal regions within the medial temporal lobe.",

    "AbstractText": "Missing data is a significant challenge in medical research. In longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) where structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is collected from individuals at multiple time points, participants may miss a study visit or drop out. Additionally, technical issues such as participant motion in the scanner may result in unusable imaging data at designated visits. Such missing data may hinder the development of high-quality imaging-based biomarkers. To address the problem of missing MRI data in studies of AD, we introduced a novel 3D diffusion model specifically designed for imputing missing structural MRI (Recovery of Missing Neuroimaging using Diffusion models (ReMiND)). The model generates a whole-brain image conditional on a single structural MRI observed at a past visit or conditional on one past and one future observed structural MRI relative to the missing observation. The performance of models was compared with two alternative imputation approaches: forward filling and image generation using variational autoencoders. Experimental results show that our method can generate 3D structural MRI with high similarity to ground-truth images at designated visits. Furthermore, images generated using ReMiND show relatively lower differences in volume estimation between the imputed and observed images compared to images generated by forward filling or autoencoders. Additionally, ReMiND provides more accurate estimated rates of atrophy over time in important anatomical brain regions than the two comparator methods. Our 3D diffusion model can impute missing structural MRI data at a single designated visit and outperforms alternative methods for imputing whole-brain images that are missing from longitudinal trajectories.",

    "AbstractText": "Accurate interpretation of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET)outcomes hinges on understanding the test-retest variability (T-RT).Previous studies of the tau-PET ligand [18F]MK-6240 reported adequateT-RT performance of tau burden estimates over a short-term 21-day and over alonger-term 6-month T-RT period, primarily involving Alzheimer's disease(AD) and cognitively normal (CN) subjects, respectively. However, several T-RTcharacteristics have not yet been reported, particularly in older CN (oCN)subjects. Here, we investigate the short-term T-RT performance of dynamic[18F]MK-6240 outcomes in a group largely consisting of oCN. Wereport T-RT for uptake in potential reference regions, for extracerebraloff-target signal, and for estimates of tau burden and relative delivery indicesin tau-bearing target regions. Eight participants (7 oCN, 1 AD) underwentbaseline dynamic [18F]MK-6240 PET/MRI (Biograph mMR) and a retestfollow-up PET/MRI scan within approximately 3 weeks. T-RT was evaluated usingabsolute percentage differences and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) inthree groups of regions: (1) potential reference regions usingstandardized-uptake values 90-110 minutes post-injection(SUV90-110); (2) target regions using SUV ratios(SUVR90-110), distribution volume ratios (DVR), andrelative delivery (R1); and (3) extracerebral region usingSUVR90-110. A voxel-based partial volume correction (PVC)was applied. T-RT was evaluated with and without PVC. In oCN subjects, theSUV90-110T-RT in the evaluated reference regions rangedfrom 6 to 11% (ICC > 0.9); target region T-RT was similar forSUVR90-110(4-9%, ICC: 0.62-0.97), DVR(3-10%, ICC: 0.66-0.92), and R1(3-14%, ICC:0.52-0.97). PVC had minimal impact on reference regionSUV90-110T-RT, but increased target region T-RTvariability (SUVR90-110: 10-26%; DVR: 6-22%;R1: 4-20%). Extracerebral SUVR90-110exhibited higher T-RT variability (~12%, ICC: 0.85) than other target regions(average 6%) and increased to ~15% after PVC. Our findings are consistent withprevious reports and provide further evidence of acceptable[18F]MK-6240 T-RT in low-signal oCN subjects. Our results suggest[18F]MK-6240 is suitable for detecting early tau deposition andlongitudinal changes over time, and further support the viability of[18F]MK-6240 R1to evaluate longitudinal changes inperfusion. PVC increased T-RT variability in tau burden and R1outcomes. Notably, the extracerebral signal exhibited higher T-RT variabilitythan other target and reference regions and may affect their signal.",

    "AbstractText": "In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, episodic memory is commonly investigated with the subsequent memory paradigm in which brain activity is recorded during encoding and analyzed as a function of subsequent remembering and forgetting. Impaired episodic memory is common in individuals with or at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but only few studies have reported subsequent memory effects in AD or its risk states like mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One reason for this might be that subsequent memory responses may be blunted in AD or MCI and thus less likely to manifest in fMRI signal differences. Here, we used Bayesian model selection of single-subject fMRI general linear models (GLMs) for a visual novelty and memory encoding experiment to compare the model performance of categorical and parametric subsequent memory models as well as memory-invariant models in a clinical cohort (N = 468) comprising healthy controls (HC) as well as individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and AD, plus healthy relatives of AD patients (AD-rel). We could replicate the previously reported superiority of parametric subsequent memory models over categorical models (Soch, Richter, Schütze, Kizilirmak, Assmann, Knopf, et al., 2021) in the HC and also in the SCD and AD-rel groups. However, memory-invariant models outperformed any model assuming subsequent memory effects in the MCI and AD groups. In the AD group, we additionally found substantially lower model preference for models assuming novelty compared to models not differentiating between novel and familiar stimuli. Our results suggest that voxel-wise memory-related fMRI activity patterns in AD and also MCI should be interpreted with caution and point to the need for additional or alternative approaches to investigate memory function.",

    "AbstractText": "Free-water elimination (FWE) modelling for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to estimate the free-water (FW) volume fraction, as well as FW-compensated DTI parameters. Single-shell (SS) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions are more common in clinical cohorts due to time constraints, but the FWE-DTI model is a two-compartment model, hence only well posed for multi-shell (MS) data. A regularised gradient descent (RGD) method is often applied to SS datasets and has been used to study healthy ageing, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, amongst others, largely ignoring the methodological limitations of this approach. In this study, we compared the performance of RGD fitting with SS data, to a non-linear least squares (NLS) fitting applied to MS data, using simulations and data from 620 participants aged 18 to 88 years. Consistent with previous studies, our simulations show that RGD fitting using SS data flattens the relationship between mean diffusivity (MD) estimates and their ground truth values, and introduces an artificial positive correlation between fractional anisotropy (FA) estimates and the underlying tissue ground truth MD. Neither of these biases were observed when NLS fitting was applied to MS data. In human data, a smaller number of significant voxels with positive correlations between MD and age were observed when the RGD SS algorithm was used, which is consistent with the flattening of MD profiles observed in simulations. FW-compensated FA maps produced strikingly different results depending on the method employed: the maps obtained with RGD SS identified some brain areas with a strong positive association with age, while no such positive correlations were found with MS NLS. While similar positive correlations between age and FW-compensated FA maps obtained with SS RGD have been reported, these results are only replicated when the RGD SS was used, suggesting that this apparent FA increase was likely an artefact introduced by inappropriate modelling using SS data. Our study, therefore, suggests that previous findings reported in the literature using the RGD approach should be interpreted with extreme care.",

    "AbstractText": "Circadian rhythms are driven by an internal molecular clock which controls physiological and behavioral processes. Disruptions in these rhythms have been associated with health issues. Therefore, studying circadian rhythms is crucial for understanding physiology, behavior, and pathophysiology. However, it is challenging to study circadian rhythms over gene expression data, due to a scarcity of time labels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the phases of untimed samples based on a deep neural network (DNN) architecture. This approach addresses two challenges: (1) prediction of sample phases and reliable identification of cyclic genes from high-dimensional expression data without relying on conserved circadian genes and (2) handling small sample-sized datasets. Our algorithm begins with initial gene screening to select candidate cyclic genes using a Minimum Distortion Embedding framework. This stage is then followed by greedy layer-wise pre-training of our DNN. Pre-training accomplishes two critical objectives: First, it initializes the hidden layers of our DNN model, enabling them to effectively capture features from the gene profiles with limited samples. Second, it provides suitable initial values for essential aspects of gene periodic oscillations. Subsequently, we fine-tune the pre-trained network to achieve precise sample phase predictions. Extensive experiments on both animal and human datasets show accurate and robust prediction of both sample phases and cyclic genes. Moreover, based on an Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset, we identify a set of hub genes that show significant oscillations in cognitively normal subjects but had disruptions in AD, as well as their potential therapeutic targets.",

    "AbstractText": "RECENT FINDINGS: Research on the drivers of health across the life course would ideally be based in diverse longitudinal cohorts that repeatedly collect detailed assessments of risk factors over the full life span. However, few extant data sources in the US possess these ideal features. A \"longitudinal synthetic cohort\"-a dataset created by stacking or linking multiple individual cohorts spanning different but overlapping periods of the life course-can overcome some of these challenges, leveraging the strengths of each component study. This type of synthetic cohort is especially useful for aging research; it enables description of the long-term natural history of disease and novel investigations of earlier-life factors and mechanisms shaping health outcomes that typically manifest in older age, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review current understanding of synthetic cohorts for life course research. We first discuss chief advantages of longitudinal synthetic cohorts, focusing on their utility for aging/ADRD research to concretize the discussion. We then summarize the conditions needed for valid inference in a synthetic cohort, depending on research goals. We end by highlighting key challenges to creating longitudinal synthetic cohorts and conducting life course research within them. SUMMARY: The idea of combining multiple data sources to investigate research questions that are not feasible to answer using a single cohort is gaining popularity in epidemiology. The use of longitudinal synthetic cohorts in applied research-and especially in ADRD research-has been limited, however, likely due to methodologic complexity. In particular, little guidance and few examples exist for the creation of a longitudinal synthetic cohort for causal research goals. While building synthetic cohorts requires much thought and care, it offers tremendous opportunity to address novel and critical scientific questions that could not be examined in a single study.",

    "AbstractText": "There is a growing body of literature on factor analysis that can capture individual and shared structures in multi-modal data. However, few of these approaches incorporate biological knowledge such as functional genomics and functional metabolomics. Graph-guided statistical learning methods that can incorporate knowledge of underlying networks have been shown to improve predication and classification accuracy, and yield more interpretable results. Moreover, these methods typically use graphs extracted from existing databases or rely on subject matter expertise which are known to be incomplete and may contain false edges. To address this gap, we propose a graph-guided Bayesian factor model that can account for network noise and identify globally shared, partially shared and modality-specific latent factors in multimodal data. Specifically, we use two sources of network information, including the noisy graph extracted from existing databases and the estimated graph from observed features in the dataset at hand, to inform the model for the true underlying network via a latent scale modeling framework. This model is coupled with the Bayesian factor analysis model with shrinkage priors to encourage feature-wise and modal-wise sparsity, thereby allowing feature selection and identification of factors of each type. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling. We demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing methods in simulations, and through analyses of gene expression and metabolomics datasets for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "AbstractText": "Based on available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, hippocampal alteration is one of the hallmarks during cognitive decline. However, the longitudinal hippocampal morphometric changes during the initial cognitive decline are unclear. Exploring a validated biomarker with high clinical relevance is urgent. This work proposed an automated MRI-driven longitudinal hippocampal alteration analysis system (LHAAS), which consists of hippocampal segmentation, reconstruction, registration, multivariate morphometric feature extraction, and longitudinal analysis of hippocampal morphometric and volumetric differences between groups. LHAAS was applied on two groups: cognitive unimpaired (CU) participants who maintained cognitive unimpaired (non-Progressors), and participants who converted to MCI during the following four years (Progressors). LHAAS can detect and visualize subtle deformations in the bilateral hippocampus of CU progressors four years before they show initial cognitive decline. For CU progressors, hippocampal atrophy initially occurs at the CA1 subregion and then along with disease progression, spreading to the CA2-3 and Subiculum subregion, exhibiting a left-greater-than-right trend. The volumetric analyses showed similar results. Besides, hippocampal subregions highly correlated with clinical measurement were identified by correlation analysis. LHAAS can accurately reflect the small hippocampal subregional atrophy at preclinical AD. This proposed system can track the longitudinal hippocampal alterations in the early stages of AD and provide insights for early intervention. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: LHAAS offers early detection of subtle hippocampal alterations at preclinical AD. This advance enables pathological research and timely interventions to potentially improve patient outcomes in clinical implementation.",

In the current study, 74 MCI patients were allocated to three groups: non-intervention (Control), PE, and PE with cognitive training (Mixed). Blood serum was received at the Baseline and after the intervention (at 3 months). Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Αβ42, Αβ40, tau and p-tau181 were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Inspired by this discovery, a total of 63 endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy tissues of the collected H. javanica plants, including 52 fungal strains belonging to nine genera and 11 unidentified strains based on morphological characteristics. Using HPLC, 9 Hup-producing fungi were identified when compared to the standard HupA and HupB. Surprisingly, 7 fungal strains produced both HupA and HupB, among which strain TLC12 produced the highest HupA and HupB contents of 0.271 and 0.163 mg/g mycelium dry cell weight (gdcw), respectively. Fungal strains TLC19 and TLC22 only yielded a respective amount of 0.305 and 0.135 mg/ gdcw of HupA.

For example, amyloid PET visualizes the build-up of amyloid plaques that appear in earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while structural MRIs depict brain atrophy appearing in the later stages of the disease. To accurately model multi-modal longitudinal data, we propose an interpretable self-supervised model called Self-Organized Multi-Modal Longitudinal Maps (SOM2LM). SOM2LM encodes each modality as a 2D self-organizing map (SOM) so that one dimension of each modality-specific SOMs corresponds to disease abnormality. The model also regularizes across modalities to depict their temporal order of capturing abnormality. When applied to longitudinal T1w MRIs and amyloid PET of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=741), SOM2LM generates interpretable latent spaces that characterize disease abnormality. When compared to state-of-art models, it achieves higher accuracy for the downstream tasks of cross-modality prediction of amyloid status from T1w-MRI and joint-modality prediction of individuals with mild cognitive impairment converting to AD using both MRI and amyloid PET.

The exposure can happen through sources like food, water and the environment. A significant number of the risk factors are modifiable, that is; their effects can be altered by minor modifications kept under consideration. This article describes four such modifiable risk factors- exposure to metals, high levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the plasma, exposure to pesticides and chronic consumption of alcohol. Heavy metals can enter our bodies through various sources like water, food (through the soil), and through sources like cigarette smoke. They can alter normal brain functioning and increase the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. High levels of plasma homocysteine can also be a risk factor, with various proposed potential mechanisms. Pesticide use may have some alarming consequences. The effects of many pesticides on increasing the chances for AD are proven by many studies, which also show that occupational exposure to them is a great risk. Another risk factor discussed is the heavy consumption of alcohol, which plays a role in altering the neurotransmitter release, which may lead to it being a risk factor for AD. The type of alcohol consumed also had varied effects. Some strategies to mitigate the risk of the modifiable risk factors have been discussed.",

The two most important proteins are extracellular amyloid βeta (Aβ) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated Tau that are contained in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles respectively. AD accounts for cognitive impairment and progressive neuronal degeneration eventually, there is significant cerebral atrophy due to neuronal cell death. Initially, there is synaptic damage, synaptic loss plays a strong role in cognitive impairment in patients with AD. Also, evidence suggests that modifications in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus plays a role in AD. It has been investigated that synaptic pathology and defective neurogenesis in AD are related to progressive accumulation of Aβ oligomers rather than fibrils. Aβ oligomer formation occurs when the APP is cleaved off and subsequently Aβ protein that is generated due to this cleavage is not cleared off by the ApoE mechanism.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Heat shock proteins regulates Tau protein aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of integrity and function of the cell, leading to progressive neuronal loss and ultimately dementia. Tau is one of the most soluble protein mainly involved in assembly and disassembly of microtubules (MT) which helps in the anterograde and retrograde transport of cargos. However in AD conditions Tau is subjected to various insults such as hyperphosphorylation, glycation, glycosylation, truncation, acetylation, oxidation etc., which leads to the loss-of-function. Thus modified Tau loses its affinity for MT and aggregates to form toxic oligomers followed by matured neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which attains cross-β structure. The cellular machinery such as chaperones, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and lysosomes tries to resolve these aggregates and helps in its clearance. During AD pathology the cellular machinery fails to clear aggregates and leads to neuronal death. In this aspect several strategies have been employed to prevent Tau aggregation that includes inhibitors for kinases, activators for phosphatases, small molecule activators of heat shock protein response and small molecules that can prevent Tau aggregation and increases its association with chaperones.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative condition, marked by memory loss and a steady deterioration in cognitive function. Lipid metabolism, which encompasses different lipid types such sphingolipids, cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, and fatty acids, is one of the key components of AD pathogenesis. These lipids are essential for many cellular functions, and the onset and course of AD are greatly influenced by their dysregulation. Sphingolipids, which include gangliosides, sulfatides, ceramides, and sphingomyelins, are essential for signal transduction, myelin sheath development, and the integrity of cell membranes. Sphingolipid metabolism is altered in AD, as seen by changes in ceramide levels and a reduction in sulfatides. These changes are associated with inflammation and neuronal death. Additionally, sphingomyelins and gangliosides are implicated; specific alterations in their concentrations have been reported in brains affected by AD, suggesting their participation in amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and neurodegeneration.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently no effective treatment options. Increasing evidence suggests that AD is a systemic disease closely associated with the immune system, not merely a central nervous system (CNS) disorder. Immune cells play crucial roles in the onset and progression of AD. Microglia and astrocytes are the primary inflammatory cells in the brain that can sensitively detect changes in the internal environment and transform into different phenotypes to exert differing effects at various stages of AD. Peripheral immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils can also be recruited to the CNS to mediate the inflammatory response in AD. As such, investigating the role of immune cells in AD is particularly important for elucidating its specific pathogenesis. This review primarily discusses the roles of central innate immune cells, peripheral immune cells, and the interactions between central and peripheral immune cells in the development of neuroinflammation in AD. Furthermore, we listed clinical trials targeting AD-associated neuroinflammation, which may represent a promising direction for developing effective treatments for AD in the future.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that accounts for 60% of dementia cases worldwide. Despite the lack of concrete information about the prevalence of dysphagia among AD patients, it still significantly impairs their quality of life (QoL). That outcome necessitates more investigations to understand the pathophysiology of this condition and how to manage it. In this study, we examined if AD-associated changes in pharyngeal and tongue muscles could explain dysphagia. METHODS: Fourteen adult male rats were allocated into 2 groups: Group I (control) received distilled water orally, group II (AD) received aluminum chloride (AlCl3) (200 mg/kg, per os) and D-galactose (60 mg/kg, subcutaneous) daily for 45 days. Biochemical parameters were conducted, including amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ), histopathological investigation of the hippocampus, tongue, and pharynx, and immune-histochemical expression of brain glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP). RESULTS: Our AD model showed marked cognitive impairment, hippocampal oxidative stress, and increased brain Aβ expression (P=0.0003) compared to controls. Dysphagia was confirmed by loss of body weight (P=0.0077) and decreased eating and drinking patterns by 25%-35% in AD versus the control group. Histopathological, immune-histochemical, and biochemical evidence, including increased levels of pharyngeal Aβ (P=0.0017), were detected in AD rats' tongue and pharyngeal muscles. CONCLUSION: Dysphagia in AD can result not only centrally but also due to local involvement of the tongue and pharynx. Further translational studies linking dysphagia to AD pathology will be needed.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is identified by the gradual decline in memory and cognitive function. It is classified by the deposition of Aβ plaques, the build-up of intracellular neurofibrillary tangle (NFT), and neuron loss. Neurotrophic factors play a critical role in the treatment of AD. However, utilizing such neurotrophins has encountered certain difficulties and side effects. Novel technological advancements prioritize innovative dipeptide usage, which offers fewer side effects. METHODS: The present study endeavors to analyze the compound hexamethylenediamide bis-(N-monosuccinyl-glutamyl-lysine) (lab name: H-MGL), a newly discovered neurotrophin mimetic dipeptide, to alleviate memory impairment in an intracerebroventricular single dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Alzheimer model in rats. We arranged 4 groups: Sham and groups receiving STZ and STZ + H-MGL (1 and 2 mg/kg). The H-MGL was administered consecutively for 14 days following the STZ injection. Then, the Morris water maze test was performed. RESULTS: The findings suggest that administration of STZ caused a significantly increment in mean escape latency and mean traveled distance in acquisition days. H-MGL at a 1 mg/kg dosage failed to yield any notable improvement in rats compared to STZ. By contrast, 2 mg/kg of H-MGL dosage led to a significant decrease in the latency to first platform crossing and frequency of platform crossings. CONCLUSION: Consequently, the findings above have engendered the notion that H-MGL partially ameliorates cognitive impairment, so it may hold promise for having low side effects to alleviate cognitive deficits in AD or potentially decrease the symptoms associated with its progression.",

Our previous study proved that Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd. aqueous extract (sweet tea aqueous extract, STAE) effectively inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal cell injury. However, it is not clear whether STAE can protect against AD, and its underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the possible behavioral and neurochemical effects of STAE on Aβ 25-35-induced AD rats administered STAE (20, 40, 80 mg/mL) for 14 days. We showed that STAE administration significantly and dose-dependently ameliorated the cognitive deficits in the AD rat models, assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, Y-maze test, and novel object recognition (NOR) test. The results of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Nissl staining showed that after treatment with STAE, the pathological damage to the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons of rats was significantly improved. Furthermore, STAE dose-dependently inhibited microglia and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus of rats accompanied by increased protein expression of silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 6 (SIRT6) and decreased protein expression of nod-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3) and its downstream pyroptosis-related genes after following Aβ 25-35. In summary, our findings indicate that STAE effectively inhibits Aβ 25-35-induced learning and memory impairment in rats, and the mechanism is, at least partially, related to the regulation of SIRT6/NLRP3 signaling pathway.",

Adults with Alzheimer disease have been shown to rely on emergency departments (EDs) as a source for care. This report describes ED visits by adults age 65 and older with Alzheimer disease according to selected patient and visit characteristics and compares them with visits by adults without Alzheimer disease. METHODS: Data in this report are from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative annual survey of nonfederal general and short-stay hospitals. Results are presented by combining data for 2020, 2021, and 2022 for more detailed subgroup analyses. Estimates and their corresponding variances were calculated using SAS-callable SUDAAN software and were based on 3-year annual averages. Differences between rates and percentages were evaluated using two-sided significance  t  tests at the 0.05 level. KEY FINDINGS: During 2020-2022, the annual ED visit rate by adults age 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease was 36.1 visits per 1,000 adults and increased with age. ED visit rates were highest among Black non-Hispanic people. Ambulance arrival was more frequent for ED visits by adults with Alzheimer's disease (61.0%) compared with visits by those without Alzheimer's disease (34.9%). About one-third (29.6%) of ED visits by adults with Alzheimer's disease were made by nursing home residents, higher than the corresponding percentage of visits by adults without Alzheimer's disease (5.9%). Approximately 37.2% of ED visits made by adults with Alzheimer's disease resulted in hospital admission, which was higher than the corresponding percentage of visits by those without Alzheimer's disease (28.6%).",

    "AbstractText": "A traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomer is a bioactive compound extracted from Chinese herbal medicines possessing determined biological activity and pharmacological effects, and has gained much attention for treating neuronal diseases. However, the application of TCM monomers is limited by their low solubility and poor ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) ranging in size from 30 to 150 nm in diameter and can be used as drug delivery carriers that directly target cells or tissues with unique advantages, including low toxicity, low immunogenicity, high stability in blood, and the ability to cross the BBB. This review discusses the biogenesis, components, stability, surface modification, isolation technology, advantages, and disadvantages of exosomes as drug carriers and compares exosomes and other similar drug delivery systems. Furthermore, exosome-encapsulated TCM monomers exert neuroprotective roles, such as anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, anti-mitophagy, and anti-oxidation, in various neuronal diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (CI/R) injury, as well as anti-drug resistance, anti-tumorigenesis, anti-angiogenesis, and promotion of apoptosis in brain tumors, providing more inspiration to promote the development of an exosome-based delivery tool in targeted therapy for neuronal diseases.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Translational Medicine in Alzheimer's Disease: The Journey of Donanemab From Discovery to Clinical Application.",
    "AbstractText": "Substantial research has been conducted to identify an efficient treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing treatments, including cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, do not reverse or slow the disease course but only treat its manifestations. This limitation has brought attention to the need for treatments that modify the amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology of the disease. One recent advancement in AD treatment is donanemab, a monoclonal antibody intended to clear Aβ plaques in the brain. It targets pyroglutamyl(3)-Aβ protein (3-42) to remove Aβ deposits and alter the disease course. This review explores the timeline of donanemab use from discovery to clinical use. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drug are discussed along with typical and suboptimal preclinical and clinical trial results in terms of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Thus, donanemab is more effective than donepezil and rivastigmine in removing plaques and improving cognition. At the same time, it is not devoid of safety concerns that are typical of the majority of amyloid-targeted medicines. The control to end the treatment after plaque cleaning is a unique selling point for some patients, making it more attractive. The innovation and development of donanemab from research to clinical practice are a clear representation of the role of the field of translational medicine in the practical application of new knowledge in the treatment of AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with characteristic biological markers. Clinically, AD presents as declines in memory, reasoning, and decision making, but the loss of memory is particularly associated with hippocampal damage. Likewise, excessive ethanol consumption has been found to disrupt hippocampal function and integrity. To assess the potential shared consequences of AD pathology and ethanol, 5xFAD mice were administered 5 g/kg ethanol daily for 10 days. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed ethanol and AD converged to lead to microglial and astrocytic senescence as well as increased Aß-plaque formation in the hippocampus. Despite the exacerbation of these potential mechanisms of neurodegeneration, there were no additive effects of ethanol exposure and AD-related genotype on Fluoro-Jade C (FJC)+ cells or cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition task. Overall, these results are the first to characterize the effects of ethanol exposure on early adulthood in the 5xFAD mouse model. Together these findings support the idea that alcohol can influence AD pathology; however, the mechanisms involved in AD progression (e.g., glial activation and Aß-plaque) may be impacted prior to evidence of pathology (e.g., cognitive decline or neuronal loss).",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The discovery of an ideal and effective therapy is urgently required for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3β expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with AD. GSK-3β activation or upregulation can contribute to neurodegeneration by promoting amyloid beta (Aβ) production and tau hyperphosphorylation. Whereas the underlying mechanism for abnormal production of GSK-3β in AD brains remains unclear. METHODS: Maestro was used, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction Qikprop was used, for docking studies Glide module was used, Binding energy prediction the Prime was used and Molecular dynamic simulation (MDs) studies done using Desmond. RESULTS: Our focus is mainly on an in-silico approach, focusing on library generation; first draw an IMID2 (imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide) scaffold structure at Enamine and subjected it to a substructure search to target the receptor grid region (ATP-competitive site) of 6Y9R. They were then subjected to various screening processes. Finally, nine compounds were subjected to MDs studies. CONCLUSIONS: Nine compounds showed good results with the most stable interactions.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: In the diagnostic criteria for lvPPA (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011), \"speech (phonologic) errors in spontaneous speech and naming\" is a secondary criterion, but studies of naming error patterns in PPA have not found evidence to support this criterion. Furthermore, only a few studies have examined naming error patterns in PPA. AIMS: In the current study, we examined the pattern of naming errors for nouns and verbs in all three subtypes of PPA, as well as unclassifiable PPA and typical (amnestic) Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statistical analyses focused on three common error types: phonological, semantic, and circumlocution errors. METHODS & PROCEDURES: The final sample included 35 participants with PPA and four participants with typical AD. Participants were asked to name 284 noun pictures and 116 verb pictures. Separately for nouns and verbs, repeated-measures ANCOVA was used to examine the interaction between Error Type and Diagnostic Subtype.Twenty of the participants also completed a structural MRI scan. For these participants, we examined the relationships between naming errors and brain volume within ten left hemisphere regions of interest (ROIs). OUTCOMES & RESULTS: In lvPPA, the proportion of phonological errors was significantly lower than the proportion of semantic errors for verbs. In svPPA, uPPA, and typical AD, semantic errors were significantly greater than phonological errors for both nouns and verbs. In between-subtype analyses, the proportion of semantic errors for nouns was significantly greater for participants with svPPA and uPPA, compared to those with nfvPPA.For nouns, the MRI analyses revealed significant negative correlations between the proportion of circumlocution errors and volume in the left inferior temporal gyrus and the left fusiform gyrus. For verbs, there were significant negative correlations between circumlocution errors and volume in the left insula, and between semantic errors and volume in the left superior temporal pole. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that semantic naming errors may be common for both nouns and verbs in typical AD and all subtypes of PPA, with the possible exception of nouns in nfvPPA. In contrast, phonological naming errors were not significantly more common than semantic errors in any diagnostic subtype. Furthermore, phonological naming errors were not significantly more common in lvPPA, compared to any other diagnostic subtype.",

We observed significant seasonal fluctuations-higher in winter in lab tests such as glucose, neutrophils per 100 white blood cells (WBC), and WBC. Notably, certain leukocyte types like eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are elevated during summer, likely reflecting seasonal respiratory diseases and allergens.

METHODS: Network pharmacology and bioinformatics identified target pathways. An Alzheimer's disease model was induced in male wistar rats using Aβ25-35, AlCl3, and RHTGF-β1(referred to as compound Aβ). Memory impairment was confirmed with the Morris water maze. Modeled rats were assigned to a control group and three SSF-treated groups for 33 days. Passive avoidance learning abilities were assessed with a step-down test, and p-crebser133 expression in the hippocampus was detected via immunohistochemistry. Real-time qPCR and western blotting measured mRNA and protein levels of c-Raf, MEKs, Rsk, and zif268 in the hippocampus and cortex. RESULTS: Pathways such as the calcium signaling pathway, Apelin signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway were highlighted by KEGG analysis. The model had an 83.30% success rate. Model rats showed dry coats and unresponsiveness, while SSF treatment improved appearance and behavior. In passive avoidance tests, model rats made more errors and had shorter latencies (P < 0.01). They also showed decreased p-CREBSer133 and increased c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs levels (P < 0.01), with reduced Zif268 (P < 0.01). SSF reversed these effects, enhancing p-CREBSer133 and Zif268 while regulating c-Raf, Rsk, and P-MEKs (P < 0.01).

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can lead to the expression of molecular chaperones in the ER, which helps in restoring cellular homeostasis. Researchers have highlighted the role of ER stress in the progression of AD, suggesting that regulating it could be a potential treatment strategy for AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We induced AD in mice by injecting amyloid beta-peptide 25-35 (Aβ25-35) bilaterally into the CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. Some mice were administered celastrol intraperitoneally before the Aβ25-35 injection, while others received it after the injection. The mice underwent the Barnes maze cognitive test and Morris water maze test to assess learning and memory impairment. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-10 were measured to evaluate inflammation, while total antioxidant capacity, catalase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase levels were analyzed to estimate oxidative stress. RESULTS: Our study showed that pre-treatment with celastrol could prevent learning and memory decline in AD mice by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Celastrol also inhibited AD-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. Additionally, celastrol suppressed AD progression by targeting ER stress. These results suggest that celastrol treatment could be beneficial in addressing learning and memory deficits in AD, paving the way for potential neuroprotective treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Celastrol effectively improved learning and memory impairments in AD mice by targeting ER stress-induced inflammation and oxidative stress.

Initially affecting the hippocampus and entorhinal complex, which are responsible for memory, the disease later impacts the cerebral cortex, controlling language, logic, and social conduct. While the exact cause is unknown, genetic mutations and environmental factors are implicated. Diagnosis involves computed tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and lumbar punctures to detect brain abnormalities, protein deposits, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. AD features beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles that disrupt neuronal function, chronic inflammation, blood-brain barrier impairment, brain atrophy, and neuronal death. There is no cure; current treatments manage symptoms and slow cognitive decline. Research into genetic, cellular, and molecular pathways aims to develop targeted therapies. Tau tangle accumulation is closely linked to AD, making it crucial to explore therapies that restore normal tau pathways and prevent tau accumulation. Nanoparticulate drug delivery technologies offer promise in this area. This review discusses the potential of nanotechnology-based therapies to target AD-related tau accumulation and restore normal tau protein mechanics, which could preserve neuronal transmission, synaptic integrity, and brain tissue volume.",

Though traditionally classified as Tau and α-synuclein-related disorders, respectively, there is growing evidence of clinical overlap between dementia and Parkinsonism, with comorbidity worsening cognitive impairment and prognosis. Emerging research on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) offers promising insights into novel treatments of these proteinopathies by targeting the phase behavior of the disease-associated proteins. Thus, manipulating condensates has become a focus for developing new therapeutic compounds, termed condensate-modifying drugs (c-mods), by which historically considered undruggable proteins can be targeted. This review offers an overview of bioactive molecules that act as modifiers of Tau and α-synuclein condensates through various mechanisms. The goal is to lay the groundwork for discovering new therapeutic approaches to prevent harmful protein aggregation and treat comorbidity in tau and synucleinopathies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Comprehensive investigation of multiple targets in the development of newer drugs for the Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease, a significant contributor to dementia, is rapidly becoming a serious healthcare concern in the 21st century. The alarming number of patients with Alzheimer's disease is steadily increasing, which is contributed by the dearth of treatment options. The current treatment for Alzheimer's disease is heavily dependent on symptomatic treatment that has failed to cure the disease despite huge investments in the development of drugs. The clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease with limited drugs is generally targeted towards the inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and acetylcholine esterase, which only elevate cognition levels for a limited period. Beyond the aforementioned molecular targets, β-amyloid was much explored with little success and thus created a feel and palpable growing emphasis on discovering new putative and novel targets for AD. This has inspired medicinal chemists to explore new targets, including microglia, triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem-2), and notum carboxylesterase, to discover new lead compounds. This review explores the functions, pathophysiological roles, and importance of all AD-related targets that address therapeutic and preventive approaches for the treatment and protection of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Ergothioneine Suppresses Amyloid β-Induced Tau Phosphorylation and Cytotoxicity by Inactivating Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β in Cultured Neurons.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers, formed by Aβ aggregation, are the causative agent of Alzheimer's disease and induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein (Tau) and neurotoxicity. The antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO) is transferred to the brain after oral ingestion and protects against Aβ- induced neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction. However, the impact of ERGO on Aβ oligomer-induced Tau phosphorylation remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ERGO on Aβ-induced Tau phosphorylation and their mechanism in neurons. METHOD: SH-SY5Y cells differentiated into cholinergic neuron-like cells or primary cultured neurons derived from the murine hippocampus were pretreated with ERGO and exposed to Aβ25-35 oligomers. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by assessing the chemiluminescence of dead cell-derived proteases. The expression of phosphorylated (p-) Tau at serine 396, p-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) at serine 9, amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; β-secretase), and nicastrin, which is a component protein of the γ-secretase complex, was assessed by western blotting. RESULT: Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited increased neurite outgrowth and mRNA expression of choline acetyltransferase, and showed cholinergic neuron-like characteristics compared with those of undifferentiated cells. ERGO significantly suppressed the Aβ25-35 oligomer-induced increased cytotoxicity and p-Tau expression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and cultured hippocampal neurons. ERGO recovered the decreased expression of p-GSK-3β at serine 9, indicating its inactivation, and the increased expression of APP, BACE1, and nicastrin induced by Aβ25-35 oligomer exposure in cultured hippocampal neurons. These ERGO effects on Aβ25-35 oligomers were inhibited by treatment with LY294002, which activated GSK-3β. CONCLUSION: ERGO may suppress the increased expression of p-Tau and proteins involved in Aβ production induced by Aβ oligomers by inactivating GSK-3β, thereby mitigating neurotoxicity.",

    "AbstractText": "As the percentage of geriatric patients continues to increase in both the United States and globally, the prevalence of both cardiovascular disease and dementia continues to climb. Both dementia and cardiovascular disease are devastating diseases that impose a significant burden economically, socially, and medically on both a local and systemic level. The most common fatal manifestation of cardiovascular disease is acute myocardial infarction, responsible for death in more than 80% of patients with cardiovascular disease. Prominent risk factors for acute myocardial infarction including hypertension and atherosclerosis have been independently associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease, separate from vascular dementia. Acute myocardial infarction itself has also been independently associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease. It is based on the connection between acute myocardial infarction, its major risk factors, and the incidence of dementia that it is of importance to define and explore the potential role that therapies for these conditions, as well as acute myocardial infarction itself, may play in mitigating the risk of dementia onset and severity. In this review, we assess current therapeutics that exist for atherosclerosis, hypertension and acute myocardial infarction that have been demonstrated to reduce later risk of dementia, and explore the mechanism that underlies the association between the incidence of acute myocardial infarction and the risk of dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Living with dementia can be challenging, even more so for people diagnosed before age 65. Loss of identity is one of the main subjective consequences dementia poses at this stage in life due to the loss of social relations and daily activities. While a growing body of research is reporting the experienced impact of early-onset dementia on identity for this group, studies synthesizing this knowledge are very limited. Therefore, we have conducted a meta-ethnographic review to explain how people with early-onset dementia form their sense of identity. METHOD: A systematic review of literature from five databases was conducted. Ten original studies published between 2004 and 2020 were included and analyzed using an interpretive approach. FINDINGS: A conceptual interpretation emerged from the analysis, showing that social arenas and activities of daily life, as well as assumptions about dementia and natural aging made by the participants and society, influenced the participants' sense of identity. CONCLUSION: Being in nonjudgmental environments can support people with early-onset dementia in creating continuity and positive connections in their personal history. Providing such environments can be a viable venue for healthcare professionals to support people with early-onset dementia in maintaining a positive sense of identity.",

    "AbstractText": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP), especially Swedish mutant APP (APPswe), is recognized as a significant pathogenic protein in Alzheimer's disease, but limited research has been conducted on the correlation between APPswe and the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The effects of APPswe and its intracellular and extracellular segments on the osteogenic differentiation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced MSCs were analyzed in this study. Our analysis of an existing database revealed that APP was positively correlated with the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs but negatively correlated with their proliferation and migration. Furthermore, APPswe promoted BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, while APPswe-C (APPswe without an intracellular segment) had the opposite effect; thus, the intracellular domain of APPswe may be a key factor in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Additionally, both APPswe and APPswe-C inhibited the proliferation and migration of MSCs. Furthermore, the intracellular domain of APPswe inhibited the activity of the Notch pathway by regulating the expression of the Notch intracellular domain to promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Finally, APPswe-treated primary rat bone marrow MSCs exhibited the most favorable bone repair effect when a GelMA hydrogel loaded with BMP2 was used for in vivo experiments, while APPswe-C had the opposite effect. These findings demonstrate that APPswe promotes the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by regulating the Notch pathway, but its extracellular segment blocks the self-renewal, proliferation, and migration of MSCs, ultimately leading to a gradual decrease in the storage capacity of MSCs and affecting long-term bone formation.",

    "AbstractText": "The preclinical stage of many neurodegenerative diseases can span decades before symptoms become apparent. Understanding the sequence of preclinical biomarker changes provides a critical opportunity for early diagnosis and effective intervention prior to significant loss of patients' brain functions. The main challenge to early detection lies in the absence of direct observation of the disease state and the considerable variability in both biomarkers and disease dynamics among individuals. Recent research hypothesized the existence of subgroups with distinct biomarker patterns due to co-morbidities and degrees of brain resilience. Our ability to diagnose early and intervene during the preclinical stage of neurodegenerative diseases will be enhanced by further insights into heterogeneity in the biomarker-disease relationship. In this article, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attempt to identify the systematic patterns within the heterogeneous AD biomarker-disease cascade. Specifically, we quantify the disease progression using a dynamic latent variable whose mixture distribution represents patient subgroups. Model estimation uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the number of clusters determined by the Bayesian Information Criterion. We report simulation studies that investigate the performance of the proposed model in finite sample settings that are similar to our motivating application. We apply the proposed model to the Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals data, a longitudinal study that was conducted over 2 decades among individuals who were initially cognitively normal. Our application yields evidence consistent with the hypothetical model of biomarker dynamics presented in Jack Jr et al. In addition, our analysis identified 2 subgroups with distinct disease-onset patterns. Finally, we develop a dynamic prediction approach to improve the precision of prognoses.",

How amyloid-β deposition affects axon pathology has not been examined extensively. We used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to analyze the forebrain tissue slices of Alzheimer's disease patients. Widespread axonal amyloidosis with distinctive axonal enlargement was observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. On average, amyloid-β-positive axon diameters in Alzheimer's disease brains were 1.72 times those of control brain axons. Furthermore, axonal amyloidosis was associated with microtubule-associated protein 2 reduction, tau phosphorylation, lysosome destabilization, and several blood-related markers, such as apolipoprotein E, alpha-hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1C, and hemin. Lysosome destabilization in Alzheimer's disease was also clearly identified in the neuronal soma, where it was associated with the co-expression of amyloid-β, Cathepsin D, alpha-hemoglobin, actin alpha 2, and collagen type IV. This suggests that exogenous hemorrhagic protein intake influences neural lysosome stability. Additionally, the data showed that amyloid-β-containing lysosomes were 2.23 times larger than control lysosomes. Furthermore, under rare conditions, axonal breakages were observed, which likely resulted in Wallerian degeneration. In summary, axonal enlargement associated with amyloidosis, micro-bleeding, and lysosome destabilization is a major defect in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This finding suggests that, in addition to the well-documented neural soma and synaptic damage, axonal damage is a key component of neuronal defects in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Exosomes in neurodegenerative diseases: Therapeutic potential and modification methods.",
    "AbstractText": "In recent years, exosomes have garnered extensive attention as therapeutic agents and early diagnostic markers in neurodegenerative disease research. Exosomes are small and can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing them to target deep brain lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from different cell types may exert therapeutic effects by regulating the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, mRNAs, and disease-related proteins, thereby halting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and exhibiting beneficial effects. However, exosomes are composed of lipid bilayer membranes and lack the ability to recognize specific target cells. This limitation can lead to side effects and toxicity when they interact with non-specific cells. Growing evidence suggests that surface-modified exosomes have enhanced targeting capabilities and can be used as targeted drug-delivery vehicles that show promising results in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of existing research aimed at devising approaches to modify exosomes and elucidating their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings indicate that exosomes can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier to facilitate drug delivery and can also serve as early diagnostic markers for neurodegenerative diseases. We introduce the strategies being used to enhance exosome targeting, including genetic engineering, chemical modifications (both covalent, such as click chemistry and metabolic engineering, and non-covalent, such as polyvalent electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, ligand-receptor binding, aptamer-based modifications, and the incorporation of CP05-anchored peptides), and nanomaterial modifications. Research into these strategies has confirmed that exosomes have significant therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases. However, several challenges remain in the clinical application of exosomes. Improvements are needed in preparation, characterization, and optimization methods, as well as in reducing the adverse reactions associated with their use. Additionally, the range of applications and the safety of exosomes require further research and evaluation.",

    "AbstractText": "Neurodegeneration is marked by the altered proteostasis and protein degradation mechanism. This is caused due to the accumulation of aberrant proteins. Alzheimer's disease is one of the leading causes of neurodegeneration characterized by the aggregation of Tau and Amyloid-β proteins intracellularly and extracellularly, respectively. The intracellular aggregation of Tau triggers accumulation of oxidative stress, loss of ER and mitochondrial function, leading to the aggravation of aggregates formation. Thus, increasing the load of aberrant proteins on chaperones and degradative mechanism, such as autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system. Although several small molecules are known to target and prevent Tau aggregation, the detrimental effects in the cell due to aggregates accumulation shall not be overlooked. In such instance, small molecules that effectively target Tau aggregates and the cellular aberrations would be of great importance. Here we have discussed the efficacy of natural molecule, Limonoid, isolated from Azadirachta indica that prevents Tau aggregation and also activates the heat shock protein system. The activated heat shock protein system elevates the levels of Hsp70 that is known to interact with aberrantly folded Tau. Further, the role of Hsp70 in directing Tau clearance by macroautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy elucidates the effect of limonoids in overcoming AD pathology due to Tau aggregation.",

Despite advances in pharmacological treatments, there remains no cure or method to reverse the disease. This paper highlights the role of psychological stress as a critical yet underappreciated risk factor for cognitive decline and reviews its complex interplay with behavioral, social, and biological mechanisms. Chronic psychological stress drives physiological and behavioral changes that are linked to accelerated cognitive deterioration, particularly in older adults. Early interventions can target stress management and behavioral prevention strategies, which include physical activity, healthy diet, and social engagement. Further, key barriers to meaningful policy change to prevent and slow ADRD include lack of public awareness, stigma around mental health and aging, and misaligned funding incentives. Policy initiatives can improve brain health literacy, increase equitable access to services, and enhance community-level and environmental factors to promote healthy aging. Prioritizing stress reduction and promoting early detection and prevention can meaningfully reduce ADRD risk and progression, improving public health broadly.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of two different proteins, β-amyloid and tau. The objective of the present study was to examine the impact of bilateral administration of the cannabinoid receptor antagonist (AM251) in the hippocampus on spatial memory and tau gene expression in an Alzheimer's disease model. The β-amyloid toxin was administered bilaterally into the hippocampus of Wistar male rats to induce Alzheimer's disease. The rats were then divided into four groups: the control group (which received distilled water as a solvent for β-amyloid toxin), the lesion group (which received the β-amyloid), β-amyloid + DMSO group (as antagonist solvent), and the AM251 antagonist receiving groups. During the training course of the Morris water maze test, the antagonist of the cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist AM251 was administered bilaterally into the hippocampus for four consecutive days at doses of 5, 25, and 100 ng. To evaluate the spatial memory of the animals, the following parameters were analyzed: distance traveled, latency time to reach the hidden platform, velocity of the animals, and tau gene expression in real time. The spatial memory indices were found to be impaired following the injection of β-amyloid and the AM251 cannabinoid antagonist. Following the injection of β-amyloid toxin, there was an increase in mRNA expression of tau protein. However, no significant difference was observed between the cannabinoid antagonist and β-amyloid groups. These results indicate that β-amyloid toxin has a destructive effect on spatial memory and that cannabinoid system plays a positive role in memory formation and consolidation, However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

Recently, the use of natural compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases has garnered significant attention owing to their minimal adverse reactions. Accordingly, the potential therapeutic effect of pterostilbene (PTS) on AD has been demonstrated in multiple in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this study, we systematically reviewed and summarized the results of these studies investigating the use of PTS for treating AD. Analysis of the literature revealed that PTS may play a role in AD treatment through various mechanisms, including anti-oxidative damage, anti-neuroinflammation, anti-apoptosis, cholinesterase activity inhibition, attenuation of β-amyloid deposition, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PTS interferes with the progression of AD by regulating the activities of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), silent information regulator sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A). Furthermore, to further elucidate the potential therapeutic mechanisms of PTS in AD, we employed network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to perform molecular docking of related proteins, and the obtained binding energies ranged from -2.83 to -5.14 kJ/mol, indicating that these proteins exhibit good binding ability with PTS. Network pharmacology analysis revealed multiple potential mechanisms of action for PTS in AD. In summary, by systematically collating and summarizing the relevant studies on the role of PTS in treatment of AD, it is anticipated that this will serve as a reference for the precise targeted prevention and treatment of AD, either using PTS or other developed drug interventions.",

METHOD: Parents of children 0-8 years of age from across the United States (N = 286; 85% White; 56% women) were recruited through Prolific to participate in an online survey. RESULTS: Although 90% of parents agreed with a definition of spanking that included the word \"hitting\" and 33% used the term \"hitting\" in their definitions of spanking, parents also rated spanking as less severe than hitting. The percentage of participants who agreed that it is acceptable for parents to hit children (30%) was significantly higher than the percentage that reported it was acceptable to hit other family members (dog, 17%; wife, 1%; parent with Alzheimer's, 0%; Tukey tests, p < .001). Nearly a third of parents reported that completing the survey had changed their beliefs about spanking. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that American parents hold inconsistent beliefs about hitting children, including a judgment that it is more acceptable to hit a child than to hit a dog.

METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted, including unpaid caregivers of patients with dementia who were receiving home care in Bogotá, Colombia. The prevalence of loneliness was estimated using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Participants were also assessed regarding their satisfaction with providing care and whether they felt they received the necessary emotional support from family and friends. The association between loneliness and the patient's clinical variables, as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of the caregiver, was evaluated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) between the groups. RESULTS: A total of 52 caregivers of patients with dementia were included. Severe loneliness was present in 5.77% of caregivers, while 26.92% experienced moderate loneliness. All caregivers reported feeling satisfied with providing care to their relatives, and 71% felt that their family or friends provided the emotional support they required. Loneliness was more common among caregivers of patients with total functional dependence (OR: 4.061, p= 0.0278). Conversely, the perception of receiving emotional support from family and friends was identified as a potential protective factor against loneliness (OR: 0.184, p= 0.0104). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of loneliness in this study is lower than that reported in previous studies.

Despite the considerable endeavors devoted to discovering treatments for NDs in recent decades, the demand for efficient therapeutic agents persists. Sertoli cells (SCs) play a crucial role in providing a supportive structure and environment for the development of germ cells. SCs, whether transplanted as xenogeneic or allogeneic cells, present a viable choice for enhancing graft persistence via the release of immunomodulatory and trophic factors, including neurturin (NTN), platelet-derived growth factor, Fas (CD95) ligand (FasL), glial-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 1 (IL1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 6 (IL6), transforming growth factors, and vascular growth factor, that protect replaced cells and tissues from the immune system. However, there is currently no cohesive evidence regarding the neuroprotective influence of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. Therefore, this review focuses on assessing stem cells' neuroprotective impact on neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical settings and presenting cohesive information. A comprehensive search was conducted between 2000 and 2022. In the identification stage, after a comprehensive search across databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed/Medline, 103 papers were obtained. The search conducted in the present study yielded a total of nine relevant papers on the therapeutic effect of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. It was found that the transplantation of SCs exhibits a promising impact on enhancing the symptoms of neurological diseases in rats.

    "ArticleTitle": "Targeting ceramide-induced microglial pyroptosis: Icariin is a promising therapy for Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive dementia, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical trial results of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau regulators based on the pretext of straightforward amyloid and tau immunotherapy were disappointing. There are currently no effective strategies for slowing the progression of AD. Herein, we spotlight the dysregulation of lipid metabolism, particularly the elevation of ceramides (Cers), as a critical yet underexplored facet of AD pathogenesis. Our study delineates the role of Cers in promoting microglial pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis and necroptosis, characterized by cellular swelling, and membrane rupture mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Utilizing both in vivo experiments with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice and in vitro assays with BV-2 microglial cells, we investigate the activation of microglial pyroptosis by Cers and its inhibition by icariin (ICA), a flavonoid with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our findings reveal a significant increase in Cers levels and pyroptosis markers (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, caspase-1, gasdermin D (gasdermin D (GSDMD)), and interleukin-18 (IL-18)) in the brains of AD model mice, indicating a direct involvement of Cers in AD pathology through the induction of microglial pyroptosis. Conversely, ICA treatment effectively reduces these pyroptotic markers and Cer levels, thereby attenuating microglial pyroptosis and suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism of action against AD. This study not only advances our understanding of the pathogenic role of Cers in AD but also introduces ICA as a promising candidate for AD therapy, capable of mitigating neuroinflammation and pyroptosis through the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-NLRP3 inflammasome-gasdermin D (GSDMD) axis. Our results pave the way for further exploration of Cer metabolism disorders in neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial pyroptosis in AD.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Efficacy of Home-Based Remotely Supervised Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Managing Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Older Adults With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent among persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, there are limited safe and effective nonpharmacological treatments for controlling NPS. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising noninvasive and safe treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the effects of remotely supervised tDCS in managing NPS in older adults with mild to moderate ADRD. Forty older adults diagnosed with early-stage ADRD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive home-based active tDCS (n = 20) or sham tDCS (n = 20). RESULTS: Results showed a significantly greater improvement in the following NPS: scratching (P = 0.052, Hedges' g = -0.60 [confidence interval {CI}: -1.24, 0.04], Cliff's δ = -0.41 [CI: -0.67, -0.06]), nighttime behaviors (P = 0.041; Hedges' g = -0.62 [CI: -1.26, 0.03]; Cliff's δ = -0.41 [CI: -0.67, -0.06], and appetite/eating changes (P = 0.010; Hedges' g = -0.78 [CI: -1.43, -0.13]; Cliff's δ = -0.41 [CI: - 0.56, -0.10]). CONCLUSION: This study shows promising initial results for using home-based, remotely supervised tDCS to manage NPS, such as nighttime behaviors, changes in eating and appetite, and scratching. Larger studies with more participants are needed to explore various tDCS doses and their long-term effects on NPS.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Terahertz wave targeting modulates the dedocking of neurotransmitters with receptors.",
    "AbstractText": "Neurotransmitters are essential in regulating the functions of the nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, and various other tissue systems. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, depression, and Alzheimer's disease involve the loss of catecholamine neurons. One of the main challenges is the accumulation of catecholamine (CA) metabolites. Reducing the metabolic aggregation toxicity of the transmitter molecules remains an open question. In this work, we proposed a novel physical method, terahertz-triggered dedocking, to unbind ligand molecules that accumulate around receptor proteins, potentially alleviating neurodegenerative diseases. We found that electromagnetic stimulation at 44.5 THz successfully dissociates the DA ligand from the binding sites at the receptor by breaking weak hydrogen bonds. Using molecular docking, we identified multiple binding sites for CA neurotransmitter molecules within the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). We also characterized the terahertz fingerprints and theoretical spectra of CAs across the 0.5 to 50 THz range, revealing their microscopic vibrational modes at characteristic peak positions and elucidating how specific vibrations influence molecular conformational changes. This finding highlights the potential of terahertz radiation in regulating the nervous system and provides new theoretical support for neural drug discovery and the intervention of neurological disorders.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia linked to an elevated risk of stroke and dementia. Emerging observational evidence suggests that left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) may reduce the risk of dementia in patients with AF; however, further research is required to confirm this potential benefit. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of LAAO vs direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in reducing the risk of dementia in patients with AF. METHODS: We conducted target trial emulation using data from the TriNetX research network. Patients with AF were allocated to 2 cohorts (2270 patients in each one), treated either with LAAO or with DOACs, and balanced with propensity score matching. The primary end points were composite dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer disease. Secondary end points included mortality, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and major adverse cardiovascular events. Follow-up was conducted over 3 years. RESULTS: At 3-year follow-up, the risk of composite dementia was lower in the LAAO group than in the DOAC group (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.85). Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent results, favoring the LAAO group. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: This real-world study suggests that LAAO is associated with a lower risk of dementia in patients with AF compared with DOACs. Further prospective research with long-term follow-up is needed to validate our findings in the population with AF.",

Our study seeks to explore polymorphisms in miRNAs that regulate the BDNF gene in individuals with AD, and to reveal the relationship between these polymorphisms and APOE genotypes. METHODS: Seventy AD patients who applied to the Psychiatry outpatient clinic were recruited for the study as well as 70 healthy individuals in the same age. The cases were examined for 5 miRNAs regulating BDNF and 2 APOE SNPs using the SNPType method on the Fluidigm platform. RESULTS: In comparisons of the genotype distributions for three polymorphisms (miR-206 rs16882131, miR-30e rs112439044, miR-26b rs188612260) (p < 0.01 all) and the allele frequencies for two polymorphisms (miR-30e rs112439044, miR-26b rs188612260) (p < 0.01) detected significant differences between groups. While the APOE e4/e4 genotype was detected in 4.50% of the AD group, no individual with this genotype was observed in the control group. When the correlation between miRNA polymorphisms and APOE genotypic distributions were investigated, the miR-30e rs10489167 polymorphism showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the ε2/ε2 genotype and a statistically significant negative correlation with the e2/e3 genotype (p < 0.08 and p < 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, the miR-30e rs112439044 polymorphism exhibited a statistically significant positive correlation with the e2/e2 and ε2/ε2 genotypes (p < 0.03 and p < 0.07, respectively).

The lack of effective prevention or cure makes AD a significant concern, as it is a progressive disease with symptoms that worsen over time. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm capable of differentiating between patients with early-stage AD (mild cognitive impairment [MCI]), moderate AD, and healthy controls (C) using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. METHODS: A publicly available EEG database was utilized, with seven EEG recordings selected from each study group (MCI, AD, and C) to ensure a balanced dataset. For each 1-s segment of EEG data, 43 time-frequency features were computed. These features were then compressed over time using 10 statistical measures. Subsequently, 15 classifiers were employed to distinguish between paired groups using a 7-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: The strategy yielded better results than state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 100% accuracy in both C versus MCI and C versus AD binary classifications. This improvement translated to a 2% increase in accuracy for C versus MCI and a 4% increase for C versus AD, despite a 1.2% decrease in performance for AD versus MCI. In addition, the proposed method outperformed prior work on the same database by 4.8% for the AD versus MCI comparison. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the potential of EEG as a promising tool for early AD diagnosis.

To this end, various medical technologies and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), ranging from biosensors and raw signals to medical imaging, have been used to provide information about the state of AD. In this survey, we aim to provide a review on CAD systems for automated AD detection, focusing on different data types: namely, signals and sensors, medical imaging, and electronic medical records (EMR). METHODS: We explored the literature on automated AD detection from 2022-2023. Specifically, we focused on various data resources and reviewed several preprocessing and learning methodologies applied to each data type, as well as evaluation metrics for model performance evaluation. Further, we focused on challenges, future perspectives, and recommendations regarding automated AD diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared to other modalities, medical imaging was the most common data type. The prominent modality was Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In contrast, studies based on EMR data type were marginal because EMR is mostly used for AD prediction rather than detection. Several challenges were identified: data scarcity and bias, imbalanced datasets, missing information, anonymization, lack of standardization, and explainability. CONCLUSION: Despite recent developments in automated AD detection, improving the trustworthiness and performance of these models, and combining different data types will improve usability and reliability of CAD tools for early AD detection in the clinical practice.",

This study was based on multi-omics to investigate the mechanisms and immune characterization of AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on bulk RNA-seq (GSE122063 and GSE97760), we screened potential biomarkers for AD by differential expression analysis and machine learning algorithms. Then, we analyzed the expression characteristics and immune functions of the above biomarkers by scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA sequencing) data analysis (GSM4996463 and GSM4996462) and immune infiltration analysis. RESULTS: Five biomarkers (RBM3, GOLGA8A, ALS2, FSD2, and LOC100287628) were identified using machine learning algorithms. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of these biomarkers in astrocytes from AD samples compared to normal samples. Additionally, three key biomarkers were selected based on interaction networks, and the diagnostic models indicated high diagnostic efficacy for these biomarkers. Based on immune infiltration and correlation analyses, RBM3, GOLGA8A, and ALS2 were all highly correlated with CD8 T cell content in the immune microenvironment of AD. CONCLUSIONS: The biomarkers identified in this study demonstrate significant diagnostic potential for AD. Notably, the downregulation of RBM3 in astrocytes and the decreased presence of CD8 T cells infiltrating brain tissue are potential risk factors for AD.",

    "AbstractText": "As of 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the average life expectancy for both sexes in the United States is 77.5 years. While new advances in health have increased life expectancy, aging comes with complications that impact the development of diseases like cancer, senile dementia (non-Alzheimer), diabetes and Parkinson's. Through aging, the body's immune system declines, a process recognized as immunosenescence and which contributes to inflammaging, a state of chronic, though non-productive, inflammation that progresses with advancing age in the absence of overt infection and that contributes to the onset and progression of a spectrum of age-related pathologies. MicroRNAs are small forms of RNA that control gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cell cytoplasm. In particular, microRNA-941 (miR-941) has been found to play a critical role in the regulation of differentiation of cell populations, certain T cell subsets responsible for maintaining efficient immune surveillance in normal subjects, immune compromised individuals as well as the elderly. We propose that concerted research designed to define and characterize interventions targeting the regulatory effects of miRNA-941 specifically on T-cell subsets will benefit treatment of infectious (e.g., CoViD-19, H5N1 infection) and chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes II, diabetes III, Long Covid [i.e., Post-Acute Covid-19 Syndrome, PACS], autoimmune disease), which are most common among the aging and the immune compromised population.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Multi-target anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) compounds are promising leads for the development of AD modifying agents. Ionic compounds containing quaternary ammonium moiety were synthesized, and their multi-targeted anti-AD effects were examined. METHODS: Imidazole derivatives containing a quaternary ammonium moiety were synthesized and evaluated for their potential anti-Alzheimer properties using computational (in silico), cellular (in vitro), and animal (in vivo) models. The inhibition kinetics of both human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) were assessed. Neuroprotective effects in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-exposed PC12 cells were also examined. Furthermore, the compounds' impact on Aβ-induced memory impairment in Wistar rats was evaluated, with a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Compound 5g demonstrated acceptable cytotoxicity against human cells. This compound exhibited non-competitive dual inhibition of both hAChE and hBuChE. Additionally, compound 5g mitigated the morphological changes induced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) in PC12 cells and decreased cell mortality. It exhibited anti-oxidative stress properties, evident by reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The compound also down regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-1β and TNF-α. In vitro studies validated compound 5g's ability to inhibit lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), attenuate neuroinflammation, and prevent the autophagy-apoptosis cascade. When administered to rats with Aβ-induced memory dysfunction, compound 5g enhanced cognitive function and improved spatial memory. In the hippocampi of treated rats, there was a noted downregulation of TNF-α and NF-kB. Furthermore, compound 5g counteracted the elevated activity of AChE. Molecular modeling validated the binding of compound 5g to both steric and catalytic sites of cholinesterase enzymes. CONCLUSION: The novel quaternary ammonium derivative, compound 5g, demonstrated multi-target anti-AD properties, as evidenced by in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies.

    "AbstractText": "Cognitive impairment is largely associated with functional and structural loss in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, and scopolamine has been successfully used to mimic these deficits in rodents. The cost and side effects of drugs presently used for the treatment of AD-related cognitive impairment have prompted research into alternative products, especially natural ones with high antioxidant capacity, since oxidative stress is a major pathophysiology associated with AD. The current study evaluated the cognitive and neuroprotective effects of Vernonia amygdalina (VA) on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Thirty-five male rats, randomly divided into seven groups (n = 5), were used. Group 1 served as the control and received distilled water. Groups 2 and 3 received Vernonia amygdalina, VA (50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively) per orally (p.o.). Group 4 received 1 mg/kg scopolamine SC (i.p.). Groups 5, 6, and 7 received pretreatment with either VA 50 mg/kg, VA 100 mg/kg, or Donepezil, DP (1 mg/kg), and then in combination with SC (1 mg/kg). The animals were subjected to memory tasks using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition tasks (NORT) and sacrificed on day 14, after which their brains were isolated for biochemical and histological studies. The study showed that during MWM and NORT, spatial and non-spatial recognition memories, which were respectively impaired in the SC group compared to the control group, were reversed in the VA pretreatment groups. Scopolamine injection caused significant decreases in superoxide dismutase and catalase levels and an increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) levels in group 4 compared with the control group. Pretreatments with either VA or DP, however, caused a significant increase in the SOD and catalase levels and a decrease in the MDA level compared with the SC group. Histological studies revealed that VA was more potent in protecting the brain against SC-induced neurodegeneration and morphological alterations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Findings of this study suggest that VA attenuates scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits via inhibition of oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration and enhancement of cognition in the brains of rats.",

Twenty-Five male rats were separated randomly into 5 groups: Control (normal saline; 1ml/kg); Scopolamine (i.p; 1mg/kg); Bromelain (50mg/kg); Scopolamine + Bromelain; Scopolamine + Donepezil (reference drug, 1mg/kg). Neurobehavioral paradigms (novel object recognition, elevated plus maze, forced swimming and open field tests were assessed, followed by biochemical (MDA, SOD, AChE, NO, Total protein & IL-1b) assay in the PFC. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (Tukey's posthoc.). Values with p<0.05 were considered significant. Scopolamine reduced memory index (P<0.01) (cognitive function), ambulatory & rearing activities (P<0.05) (motor behavior), open arm duration (P<0.001) (anxiety-like behavior) & increased immobility time (P<0.05) (depressive-like behavior).

However, levels of NO and total protein were not significantly altered. In contrast, intervention with bromelain or donepezil significantly reversed most of the behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by scopolamine. Bromelain compared favorably with donepezil in improving memory decline and other non-cognitive dysfunctions associated with scopolamine exposure.

NGF, a key signaling molecule, became the first identified neurotrophic factor, influencing the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons in both peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF and related neurotrophic factors hold therapeutic potential for various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. However, despite promising in vitro studies and animal models findings, NGF efficacy in patients remains unproven.

Copper (Cu) is an essential metal involved in neural system, and its homeostasis is the key to maintain its proper function. Herein, the subcellular locations of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in human neurodegenerative disease SH-SY5Y cells and AD mouse brains were imaged. We found that the content of Cu(II) decreased while that of Cu(I) increased under Aβ exposure, which were further verified in the brain tissues of the AD mouse model, strongly suggesting the disruption of Cu homeostasis under Aβ exposure or AD. Remarkably, the mitochondrial and lysosomal Cu(II) decreased significantly, whereas Cu(I) decreased in mitochondria but increased in lysosome. Lysosomes digested the damaged mitochondria via mitophagy to remove excess Cu(I) and maintain Cu homeostasis. The Aβ induced Cu(I) in mitochondria resulted in an overformation of reactive oxygen species and altered the morphology of this organelle. Due to the oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) was converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and Cu(I) bound with GSH was further released into the cytoplasm and absorbed by the lysosome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes (ATP7A/B) related to Cu transportation were upregulated, whereas genes related to mitochondrial complex were down-regulated, representing the damage of this organelle. This study demonstrated that Aβ exposure caused the disruption of intracellular homeostasis by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and damaging the mitochondria, which further triggered detoxification by the lysosome.

Aging is a significant driver of these alterations, and dementia is a major cause of disability and mortality. Despite extensive clinical trials over the past two decades, no effective drug has been developed to improve AD symptoms or slow its progression, indicating the inefficiency of current treatment targets. In AD development, the molecular microenvironment plays a significant role. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a key component of this microenvironment, regulate post-transcriptional gene expression, and are expressed more abundantly in the brain than in other tissues. Several dysregulated miRNAs in AD have been linked to neuropathological changes, such as plaque and tangle accrual, as well as altered expression of notorious molecules. Preclinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of phytochemicals/food bioactive compounds (PCs/FBCs) in regulating miRNA expression, which makes them immensely beneficial for targeting miRNA-altered expression patterns in neuronal diseases.

Integrated and effective analysis of multiple data sources is often beyond the scope of traditional diagnostic procedures.

OBJECTIVES: A novel approach has been proposed toward the integration of different Nondestructive Evaluation data with EEG signals for improving the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, by leveraging advanced neural network techniques in order to improve the identification and correlation of shared latent features across heterogeneous NDE datasets. METHODS: We determined the 2D scalogram images using a specific encoder-decoder neural network after transforming the EEG signals using wavelet signal processing. Several NDE data types can be easily integrated for thorough analysis due to this network's ability to extract and correlate important aspects from each form of data. Aiming to uncover common patterns indicating of neurological disorders, the technique was evaluated on datasets containing EEG signals and corresponding NDE data. RESULTS: Our method demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The encoder-decoder network effectively identified shared latent features across the heterogeneous NDE datasets, leading to more precise and reliable diagnoses. The fusion of multi-modality NDE data with EEG signals provided a robust framework for the automatic identification of multiple neurological disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative approach represents a substantial advancement in the field of neurological disorder diagnosis. By integrating diverse NDE data with EEG signals through advanced neural network techniques, we have developed a method that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing multiple neurological conditions. This fusion of multi-modality data has the potential to revolutionize current diagnostic practices in neurology, paving the way for more precise and automated identification of neurological disorders.",

    "AbstractText": "Background As life expectancy increases and the global population ages, the incidence of sarcopenia is also increasing, highlighting the need for better diagnosis and treatment methods.ObjectiveTo study the genetic expression of sarcopenia using bioinformatics methods.MethodsA Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to construct coexpression networks, along with protein-protein interaction networks. Diagnostic biomarker potential was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. An analysis of Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was performed in order to determine the amount of immune cell infiltration. We analyzed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment using the KEGG.ResultsWGCNA identified modules linked to bone metabolism, ssGSEA showed unique gene enrichment patterns, and 268 genes were found to be differentially expressed in sarcopenia. Fourteen co-expression modules related to bone metabolism were identified, with one showing a strong positive correlation. KEGG pathway analysis indicated downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system and Alzheimer's disease pathways. The differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in adipocyte differentiation.ConclusionThis study analyzes genetic changes and immune cell patterns in sarcopenia, providing insights into its causes and potential diagnostic markers for future research on treatments.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Previous trials have shown improvements in both apathy and cognition with methylphenidate (MPH). OBJECTIVES: To assess whether changes in apathy correlated with changes in cognition in the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2). PARTICIPANTS: Mild to moderate AD patients with clinically significant apathy randomized to MPH (20 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-apathy (NPI-A) domain. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Hopkins Verbal Learning (immediate [HVLT-I], delayed [HVLT-D] recall), Digit Span (Forward [DF], Backward [DB]), Trail Making (TMT-A, TMT-B), Action Verbal Fluency (AV), Category Fluency (CF), and the Short Boston Naming Test (BNT). DESIGN: Linear mixed models included cognitive change scores as dependent variables and time, treatment, change in NPI-A and the interaction between treatment and change in NPI-A as independent variables, which were additionally adjusted for baseline NPI-A and cognitive scores, age, sex, level of education and presence of diabetes. RESULTS: 199 participants (66 % male) were included (98-MPH, 101-placebo). Among all participants, worsening CF was associated with worsening apathy (-0.15 (0.05), p = .003). In addition, change in HVLT-I was associated with the interaction between changes in apathy and treatment (-0.31 (0.07), p = 0.0000158). CONCLUSION: Changes in apathy are mostly independent of cognitive changes and apathy response to MPH may be independent from cognition. These results are consistent with the view that apathy as a syndrome is related to but distinct from cognition.",

DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective cohort study. SETTING: 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1FLADRC). PARTICIPANTS: 97 older adults aged 54 to 98 years who were diagnosed with aMCI following a baseline evaluation. The average age was 71.9 years, 51 % male, average education 15.7 years, and 56 % Hispanic. The mean MMSE score was 28.0. Participants were followed annually for 3 to 4 visits with a mean follow-up time of 38.9 months (range 22.7 to 70.3 months). MEASUREMENTS: CDR-SOB were obtained at each visit and the latent growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB was estimated. The associations between PSI and frPSI and the growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB were examined. RESULTS: The growth curve model that best fits the CDR-SOB trajectory was a linear form and included the fixed and random effect of intercept and slope of time. After adjusting for age, sex, education, Hispanic background, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) immediate and delayed recall, and amyloid positivity, frPSI (β = -0.134, se=0.04, p < 0.01) remained statistically significant in predicting a steeper slope on the trajectory of decline in CDR-SOB.

MEASUREMENTS: Participants rated their depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and collected diurnal salivary cortisol samples at home. Cognitive performance was assessed by standardized cognitive tests in the following domains: memory, working memory, processing speed, perceptual reasoning, and general cognitive function. Dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) were diagnosed as part of the clinical work-up. We determined the associations between GDS and cognitive domain scores using linear regressions, including cortisol levels as covariates.

Most screening methods for small-molecule hits focus on the overall Aβ aggregations without a specific target, such as the very first association step (i.e., nucleation) en route to the Aβ oligomers. Located in the middle of a full-length Aβ peptide, Aβ19-20 (diphenylalanine or FF) nucleates the neurotoxic Aβ oligomer formation. Here, we innovate a single-molecule screen method in optical tweezers by targeting the nucleation process in Aβ aggregation, namely FF-dimerization. With a 121-compound National Institutes of Health (NIH) library, we identify 12 inhibitors and 8 stimulants that can inhibit/promote Aβ19-20 dimerization significantly. The representative hits are subjected to the thioflavin T and cell toxicity assays to confirm their inhibiting or stimulating activities.

The study sought to examine whether younger onset age of OSA is associated with a higher risk of incident dementia. METHODS: This cohort study, based on the UK Biobank's prospective population data, excluded 445,023 participants due to baseline dementia diagnoses, incomplete covariate information, or pre-OSA onset dementia over a 12.6-year median follow-up. The research applied Cox regression and propensity score matching to explore the relationship between sleep apnea onset age and later development of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia. RESULTS: In a controlled study contrasting those without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), those suffering from OSA showed markedly higher risks for developing all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD), with hazard ratios (HR) of 4.243 (95% CI: 3.678-4.897), 5.668 (95% CI: 4.380-7.336), and 6.064 (95% CI: 4.008-9.175) respectively. Following adjustment with propensity score matching, OSA patients younger than 52 presented the highest risk of all-cause dementia, with an adjusted HR of 2.256 (95% CI: 1.901-3.747). This trend was consistent for early-onset AD and VD in the same age group. CONCLUSION: Younger age at OSA onset was associated with increased risk of dementia. Individuals with an onset age of OSA before 52 years of age may represent a particularly vulnerable population for dementia irrespective of subtypes and need careful monitoring and timely intervention to attenuate subsequent risk of incident dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "The rising incidence and death rates linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlight an urgent issue. Genetic screening is celebrated as a significant advancement for its early detection capabilities, pinpointing those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. Yet, the limited availability of these technologies highlights a critical gap in widespread application. This review pivots to the potential of presymptomatic clinical assessments as a readily available, economical, and simple strategy for early detection. Traditionally, AD diagnosis relies on the late-stage identification of cognitive deterioration, functional impairments, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, coinciding with advanced brain degeneration. Conversely, emerging research identifies early indicators preceding significant degeneration, manifesting years before clinical symptoms. We introduce a mnemonic, MEMORIES, to categorize these prodromal: Metabolism changes, Eye/visual impairments, March (refer to gait disturbances), Olfactory dysfunction, Rhythm (blood pressure and heart rate), Insensitivity of the tongue, Ears (hearing loss), and Stool alterations. Recognizing these prodromal through clinical examinations provides a valuable strategy for initiating preventative actions against brain degeneration. This approach advocates for broadening the screening lens beyond genetic screening to encompass clinical evaluations, enhancing early detection and intervention opportunities for AD.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is a condition that impairs cognition, memory, and behavior. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage before AD, urgently needs the development of prediction models for conversion from MCI to AD. METHOD: This study used machine learning methods to predict whether MCI subjects would develop AD, highlighting the importance of biomarkers (biological indicators from neuroimaging, such as MRI and PET scans, and molecular assays from cerebrospinal fluid or blood) and non-biomarker features in AD research and clinical practice. These indicators aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and the development of potential treatments for MCI subjects. Using baseline data, which includes measurements of different biomarkers, we predicted disease progression at the patient's last visit. The Shapley value explanation (SHAP) technique was used to identify key features for predicting patient progression. RESULTS: The study used the ADNI database to evaluate the effectiveness of eight classification methods for predicting progression from MCI to AD. Four fundamental data sampling approaches were compared to balance the dataset and reduce overfitting. The SHAP technique improved the ability to identify biomarkers and non-biomarker features, enhancing the prediction of disease progression. NEAR-MISS was found to be the most advantageous sampling method, while XGBoost was found to be the superior classification method, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive power. CONCLUSION: The proposed SHAP for feature selection combined with XGBoost may provide improved predictive accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's patients.",

It primarily defends the central nervous system against injury from acute and progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the body's natural defense mechanisms and the generation of reactive oxygen species, is crucial in developing neurological disorders. Due to its high metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, the brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Excessive ROS damages the essential biomolecules, leading to cellular malfunction and neurodegeneration. Several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic stroke, are associated with oxidative stress. Understanding the impact of oxidative stress in these conditions is crucial for developing new treatment methods. Researchers are exploring using antioxidants and other molecules to mitigate oxidative stress, aiming to prevent or slow down the progression of brain diseases.

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major form of dementia in the elderly and is closely related to the toxic effects of microglia sustained activation. In AD, sustained microglial activation triggers impaired synaptic pruning, neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, and cognitive deficits. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that aberrant expression of deubiquitinating enzymes is associated with regulating microglia function. Here, we use RNA sequencing to identify a deubiquitinase YOD1 as a regulator of microglial function and AD pathology. Further study showed that YOD1 knockout significantly improved the migration, phagocytosis, and inflammatory response of microglia, thereby improving the cognitive impairment of AD model mice. Through LC-MS/MS analysis combined with Co-IP, we found that Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), a key regulator maintaining microglia homeostasis, is an interacting protein of YOD1. Mechanistically, YOD1 binds to MYH9 and maintains its stability by removing the K48 ubiquitin chain from MYH9, thereby mediating the microglia polarization signaling pathway to mediate microglia homeostasis. Taken together, our study reveals a specific role of microglial YOD1 in mediating microglia homeostasis and AD pathology, which provides a potential strategy for targeting microglia to treat AD.",

Synergistic effects of the Aβ-Tau cascade reaction are tightly implicated in AD pathology, and microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation drives neuronal tauopathy. However, the underlying mechanism of how Aβ mediates NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. Herein, we determined that oligomeric Aβ (o-Aβ) bound to microglial Kv2.1 and promoted Kv2.1-dependent potassium efflux to activate NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in neuronal tauopathy by using Kv2.1 inhibitor drofenine (Dfe) as a probe. The underlying mechanism has been intensively investigated by assays with Kv2.1 knockdown in vitro (si-Kv2.1) and in vivo (AAV-ePHP-si-Kv2.1). Dfe deprived o-Aβ of its capability to promote microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuronal Tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting the Kv2.1/JNK/NF-κB pathway while improving the cognitive impairment of 5×FAD-AD model mice. Our results have highly addressed that the Kv2.1 channel is required for o-Aβ-driven microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuronal tauopathy in AD model mice and highlighted that Dfe as a Kv2.1 inhibitor shows potential in the treatment of AD.",

METHODS: A comprehensive search on PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus was conducted to find the relevant original studies. Language, sex, age, date, or country of study were not restricted. Included studies report increased Alzheimer's disease mortality and hospital admission. RESULTS: This increase was seen from the first day with high temperature to 3-4 days later. Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects were more vulnerable to high temperatures compared to dementia patients (RR for dementia: 1.29 and for PD: 1.41). Global warming was linked to the increase in the incidence of Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) (from 0.1% to 5.4%), Japanese encephalitis (OR: 2 when floods occur), and ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) (RR: 1.62 for each 1 ◦C increase per month).

However, the functional involvement and specificity of thalamic nuclei in human neuroimaging work is underappreciated and not well studied due, in part, to technical challenges of accurately identifying and segmenting nuclei. This challenge is further exacerbated by a lack of common nomenclature for comparing segmentation methods. Here, we use data from healthy young (Human Connectome Project, n = 100) and older healthy adults, plus those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, n = 540), to benchmark four state-of-the-art thalamic segmentation methods for T1 MRI (FreeSurfer, histogram-based polynomial synthesis [HIPS]-THOMAS, synthesized contrast segmentation [SCS]-convolutional neural network [CNN], and T1-THOMAS) under a single segmentation framework. Segmentations were compared using overlap and dissimilarity metrics to the Morel stereotaxic atlas, a widely accepted thalamic atlas. We also quantified each method's estimation of thalamic nuclear degeneration across Alzheimer's disease progression, and how accurately early and late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease could be distinguished from healthy controls. We show that the HIPS-THOMAS approach produced the most effective segmentations of individual thalamic nuclei relative to the Morel atlas, and was also most accurate in discriminating healthy controls from those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease using individual nucleus volumes. This latter result was different when using whole thalamus volumes, where the SCS-CNN approach was the most accurate in classifying healthy controls. This work is the first to systematically compare the efficacy of anatomical thalamic segmentation approaches under a unified nomenclature. We also provide recommendations of which segmentation method to use for studying the functional relevance of specific thalamic nuclei, based on their overlap and dissimilarity with the Morel atlas.",

AD is known to have disruptive local and global brain neural connections that may be instrumental in understanding and extracting specific biomarkers. Existing machine-learning approaches are mostly based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and standard vision transformer (ViT) models, which may not sufficiently capture the multidimensional local and global patterns indicative of AD.

We employed a cycle-GAN to synthesize data in an unpaired data transition and enhanced the transition by integrating weak supervision in cases where paired data were available. Our findings revealed that our model could offer remarkable capability, achieving a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.89 ± 0.003 for T1s and a correlation of 0.71 ± 0.004 for FNCs.

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to affect the lengths and frequencies of certain kinds of pauses in speech. Previous studies have used features based on pause lengths for AD classification. We conjecture that in addition to using pause lengths, it is beneficial to incorporate the \"context\" behind each pause, i.e., what is being said before and after each pause. We propose an AD detection method based on this idea. As part of the proposed method, pause lengths and context are extracted from the raw audio using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and forced alignment. Then, statistical summaries of pause lengths with context information are extracted from the transcripts and used as features for classification. Our results indicate that incorporating the context significantly improves classification performance compared to using pause lengths alone, with classification accuracy of up to 81%. Additionally, the proposed features largely preserve privacy.",

    "AbstractText": "In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, a common symptom is the impairment of senses, particularly olfaction and gustation. More comprehensive neuroimaging studies are needed to elucidate the links between these sensory functions and neural circuit alterations. In this study, we used a subset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 data containing both the neuroimaging and sensory test data (n = 50). Using high-order Group Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in combination with Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA), we studied the interplay between odor and taste sensory measures and spatiotemporal features of the resting-state networks. The findings revealed that a decline in olfaction was associated with decreased connectivity within the posterior default mode network, central executive network, and dorsal attention network. Similarly, a lower capacity for taste detection was linked to changes in the connectivity within the dorsal attention network. Conversely, enhanced taste detection was correlated with increased connectivity in the thalamus. We also found that olfaction was associated with the connectivity between the olfactory network and a cognitive network, which includes the inferior frontal orbital gyrus and Rolandic operculum. Taste, on the other hand, was associated with functional connectivity between the central executive network and the cerebellar network. Our study brings new insights into the relationship between olfaction, taste, and various resting-state networks.",

Along-tract statistical analysis of microstructural metrics can reveal the effects of neurological and psychiatric diseases with 3D spatial precision. To maximize statistical power to detect disease effects and factors that influence them, data from multiple sites and scanners must often be combined, yet scanning protocols and hardware may vary widely. For simple scalar metrics, data harmonization methods - such as ComBat and its variants -allow modeling of disease effects on derived brain metrics, while adjusting for effects of scanning site or protocol. Here, we extend this method to pointwise segment analyses of 3D fiber bundles by integrating ComBat into the BUndle ANalytics (BUAN) tractometry pipeline. In a study of the effects of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on 38 white matter tracts, we merge data from 7 different scanning protocols used in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which vary in voxel size and angular resolution. By incorporating ComBat harmonization, we model site- and scanner-specific effects, ensuring the reliability and comparability of results by mitigating confounding variables. We also evaluate choices that arise in extending batch adjustment to tracts, such as the regions used to estimate the correction. We also compare the approach to the simpler approach of modeling the site as a random effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first applications to adapt harmonization to 3D tractometry.",

AD is a health issue that is attracting attention as the world's populations get older. Although there is currently no effective treatment for this disease, early diagnosis is necessary to help people prevent it. Here, we developed an MRI-based deep learning and multi-class AD classification and prediction framework. Based on the traditional Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG19) architecture, we embedded the Convolutional Block Attention Module Attention layer to build an Alzheimer's directional prediction 3D convolution model referred to as AD_Net in this paper. We used MRI images from the ADNI open data resource to train, classify, and predict three different conditions: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN). Experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy and system robustness of AD_Net are superior to those of basic VGG19. To improve the accuracy of the prediction, we developed a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model to incorporate additional factors into the model, such as age, gender, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. We presented the model performance for groups with and without directional influence factors. Accuracy for the two groups was 51.2% and 89%, respectively.

However, current deep model research on the morphological analysis of hippocampus is mainly based on 2D MRI slices, lacking a comprehensive description of the 3D surface morphology and complex textures of the hippocampus. For this reason, we propose a two-stream multi features deep learning model that establishes a descriptive system for 3D spatial structure and morphological atrophy features on the triangular mesh of left and right hippocampus. First, we encode the triangular mesh data into the spatial structural features of the hippocampal surface. Second, considering the tubular structure of the hippocampus and the inhomogeneous morphological changes caused by AD, we introduce the thickness features and Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) features for the morphological atrophy features encoding. Third, we integrate the encoded features of adjacent faces from a macroscopic perspective into the discriminative morphological features induced by AD. Finally, driven by classification tasks, the deep learning model parameters and the discriminative features are continuously optimized, thereby improving the accuracy of AD diagnosis. Our method is evaluated based on the T 1 weighted sMRI baseline data of 269 Aβ+ AD and 437 Aβ-normal cognitively(NC) subjects collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

The underlying breakthrough generative mechanism of denoising diffusion modeling can generate high quality synthetic images and can learn the underlying distribution of complex, high-dimensional data. In our paper, we train conditional latent diffusion models (LDM) and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to provide insight into Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects on the brain's anatomy at the individual level. We first created diffusion models that could generate synthetic MRIs, by training them on real 3D T1-weighted MRI scans, and conditioning the generative process on the clinical diagnosis as a context variable. We conducted experiments to overcome limitations in training dataset size, compute time and memory resources by testing different models, effects of pretraining, training duration. We tested the sampling quality of the disease-conditioned diffusion using metrics to assess realism and diversity of the generated synthetic MRIs. We also evaluated the ability of diffusion models to conditionally sample MRI brains using a 3D CNN-based disease classifier relative to real MRIs. In our experiments, the diffusion models generated synthetic data that helped to train an AD classifier (using only 500 real MRI scans) - and boosted its performance by over 3% when tested on real MRI scans. Further, we used classifier-free guidance to alter the conditioning of an encoded individual scan to its counterfactual (representing a healthy subject of the same age and sex) while preserving subject-specific image details. From this counterfactual image (where the same person appears healthy), a personalized disease map was generated to identify possible disease effects on the brain.

We validate our model on a dataset that includes EEG recordings of 65 healthy and AD subjects. We rank the significant spatiotemporal windows for each subject and show that the features of the top-ranked windows provide significant separability between the AD and healthy subjects. We determine the most significant electrode and show that taking only the top two electrodes provides a better classification of the AD patients compared with taking all the electrodes or a random pair. Besides providing cutting-edge accuracy in classifying AD, our work provides an interpretability framework for ranking spatiotemporal information in EEG signals that can be harnessed to enhance the diagnostics of other neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Exploring causal relationship of traumatic brain injury and comorbidities: A Mendelian randomization study.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies demonstrated a link existed between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cerebral disease and multisystem complications, such as dementia, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal disease, but they could be confused by confounding and reverse causality. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to figure out the causal correlation between TBI and the following complications. METHODS: Database concerning TBI and complications from genome-wide association study (GWAS) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to examine whether TBI was causally associated with the risk of some complications. All the analysis was carried out through R, version 4.3.3. RESULTS: MR analyses indicated that any dementia has a promotional effect on TBI (OR = 1.067, 95% CI, 1.011-1.123, p = 0.017). However, there was no causal genetically association between TBI and Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), pneumonia, or gastrointestinal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to observational studies, our results uncovered little causal association between TBI and PD, AD, depression, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal diseases. Interestingly, we found any dementia might be the risk of TBI, which was a new discovery.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is the standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) to improve functional outcomes. Furthermore, AIS is an important risk factor for dementia. Limited evidence has shown the long-term benefit of IVT on dementia in Western countries. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the association between IVT and the risk of dementia in acute ischemic stroke patients in Asian population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using medical records from a medical center in Taiwan between 2017 and 2022 was conducted. We included acute ischemic stroke patients aged over 55 years old who had not previously been diagnosed with dementia. The primary outcome was incident dementia ascertained through dementia diagnosis in medical records. The inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between IVT and incident dementia. RESULTS: A total of 1471 patients with AIS were included. 939 (63.8%) were male, and the mean age was 70.7  ±  9.6 years. Among them, 19.1% of patients (n = 281) received IVT. The mean follow-up time was 2.6  ±  1.7 years. Although not statistically significant, the IVT was associated with a decreased risk of dementia (HR: 0.88 [95%CI 0.54-1.41)]). CONCLUSIONS: The IVT was associated with lower risk of dementia, although not statistically significant, in reducing the incidence of dementia in Asian patients with ischemic stroke. Studies with larger sample sizes will be needed in the future.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Gut microbiome synthesizes important core metabolites to prevent cognitive decline and mitigate onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: This study explores how gut metabolites, produced through bacterial metabolism in the gut, influence neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Key metabolites such as succinate and short-chain fatty acids signal through the autonomic nervous system and can cross the blood-brain barrier, impacting central nervous system functions. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the role of the gut microbiota in compensating for metabolic deficiencies in AD. By analyzing wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice, the study investigates how the microbiome affects key metabolic processes and whether it can slow AD progression. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing data from the gut microbiomes of APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice and age-matched WT C57BL/6 male mice were analyzed for microbial and metabolite profiles. RESULTS: Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed differences in microbial composition between groups. Partial least squares discriminant analysis and Anosim confirmed distinct microbiome profiles in WT and APP/PS1 mice. At the genus level, Vescimonas was more abundant in WT mice, while Odoribacter, Lacrimispora, Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Alloprevotella were more prevalent in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: While taxonomic differences did not directly link specific microorganisms to AD, functional analysis identified key metabolites-acetyl-CoA, glucose, succinate, lipids, choline, and acetylcholine-that may alleviate energy deficits and synaptic dysfunction. This study suggests that the microbiome may help compensate for AD-related impairments, opening avenues for microbiome-based therapies.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent, incurable, and chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β protein (Aβ), disrupting various bodily systems. Despite the lack of a cure, phenolic compounds like cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for AD. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores the impact of different types of cannabidiol on AD, unveiling their neuroprotective mechanisms. METHODS: The research used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with keywords like \"Alzheimer's disease\" and \"Cannabidiol.\" Studies were evaluated based on title, abstract, and relevance to treating AD with CBD. No restrictions on research type or publication year. Excluded were hypothesis papers, reviews, books, unavailable articles, etc. RESULTS: Microsoft Excel identified 551 articles, with 92 included in the study, but only 22 were thoroughly evaluated. In-vivo and in-silico studies indicate that CBD may disrupt Aβ42, reduce pro-inflammatory molecule release, prevent reactive oxygen species formation, inhibit lipid oxidation, and counteract Aβ-induced increases in intracellular calcium, thereby protecting neurons from apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the study indicates that CBD and its analogs reduce the production of Aβ42. Overall, these findings support the potential of CBD in alleviating the underlying pathology and symptoms associated with AD, underscoring the crucial need for further rigorous scientific investigation to elucidate the therapeutic applications and mechanisms of CBD in AD.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have indicated an inverse association between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, the relationship between liver cancer and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between dementia, specifically AD, and liver cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: We conducted a bidirectional, two-sample MR analysis using publicly available genome-wide association studies data. The inverse-variance weighted method was employed as the primary analytical approach. To detect and correct for the effects of horizontal pleiotropy, we applied three complementary methods: MR Egger, weighted median, and Maximum likelihood. RESULTS: The analysis indicated significant associations between dementia and a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (OR: 0.87; 95%CI: 0.81-0.95; p < 0.001) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.72-0.92; p < 0.001). AD was significantly associated with a decreased risk of HCC (OR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.88-0.99; p = 0.033), ICC (OR: 0.85; 95%CI: 0.78-0.93; p < 0.001), and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.43-0.93; p = 0.020). Conversely, inverse MR analyses indicated that ICC was associated with increased dementia risk (OR: 1.05; 95%CI: 1.01-1.09; p = 0.019) and CHC with increased AD risk (OR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.00-1.04; p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that dementia, particularly AD, is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. Conversely, liver cancer may be associated with a slightly increased risk of developing dementia and AD, although some observational studies have reported a lower risk of these conditions among cancer survivors.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Retina is a non-invasive channel for assessing changes in brain microvasculature, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies revealed significant relationship between clinically diagnosed AD and retinal vasculature. However, clinical diagnosis has limited sensitivity and specificity, and those investigations were conducted from traditional retinal fundus photographs which only captured a narrow section of the fundus. OBJECTIVE: Determining changes in retinal vasculature from larger area of retina between subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker-confirmed AD compared to controls. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the community and cognitive disorder clinics. Diagnosis of AD was confirmed by significant amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau uptake on PET scan. Retinal vasculature was imaged with ultra-widefield (UWF) scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and a series of vessel parameters were quantified using the semi-automated Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender and systolic blood pressure. In addition, arteriole parameters were adjusted against the same measurements in venules, and vice versa. RESULTS: Out of the 39 patients, 18 had radiologically confirmed AD. These individuals with AD showed significantly smaller arteriolar fractal dimension (p = 0.032) in UWF images and greater venular tortuosity (p = 0.011) in standard fundus images compared with controls. Presence of significant Aβ and tau burden was associated with lower arteriolar caliber (OR 3.857; 95% CI 1.014-14.67; p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of fractal dimension in retinal arterioles observed in UWF imaging is associated with cerebral Aβ and tau burden in people with biomarker-confirmed AD. Wide field retinal imaging provides an alternative perspective in demonstrating microvascular alterations related to AD in this pilot study.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Conducting longitudinal cognitive analyses is an essential part of understanding the underlying mechanism of Alzheimer's disease, especially for social and health behavior determinants. However, the cognitive test administration is highly likely to change across time and thus complicate the longitudinal analyses. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study assessed memory through word recall tests across five study waves from 2011 to 2020. Since 2018, changes in the test stimuli and administration posed challenges for longitudinal cognitive analyses. OBJECTIVE: To address differences in administration and to preserve differences attributed to characteristics such as age and education and to derive equated scores for use in longitudinal analyses in CHARLS. METHODS: To ensure consistent underlying test ability across waves in the full sample (N = 19,364), we derived a calibration sample (N = 11,148) balancing age, gender, and education. Within this sample, we used weighted equipercentile equating to crosswalk percentile ranks between 2015 and 2018/2020 scores, then applied the algorithm to the full sample. RESULTS: Mean original delayed word recall was higher in 2018 (4.3 words) and 2020 (5.1 words) versus 2015 (3.2 words). Following equating, scores in 2018 and 2020 aligned better with previous waves (2015, 2018, 2020 immediate means: 4.1, 3.6, 4.0; delayed: 3.2, 2.4, 2.9 words). CONCLUSIONS: Equipercentile equating enables the derivation of comparable scores, facilitating longitudinal analysis when cognitive test administration procedures change over time. We recommended the use of equated scores for longitudinal analyses using CHARLS cognitive data.",

Nucleus basalis of Meynert deep brain stimulation (NBM-DBS) is a potential treatment approach. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of NBM-DBS for AD patients. METHODS: We conducted a clinical study involving 6 patients with severe AD who received NBM-DBS. The treatment's safety and efficacy were evaluated using cognitive function tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale- cognitive subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating) and assessments of neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders (Functional Activity Questionnaire, Functional Independence Measure, Zarit Burden Interview, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). RESULTS: NBM-DBS was safe, with no severe adverse events. It improved cognitive functions and self-care abilities without altering the disease's progression. Notably, NBM-DBS significantly alleviated neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: NBM-DBS could be a promising therapeutic approach for severe AD, particularly for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, blood transcriptome analyses of patients with AD, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and heathy controls were performed to elucidate immune-related pathophysiology. METHODS: The sample included 63 participants from a complete enumeration study of elderly people in Nakayama town (the Nakayama Study), who were over 65 years of age, diagnosed as (1) healthy controls (N = 21, mean age: 83.8 years), (2) having MCI due to AD (N = 20, mean age: 82.6 years), or (3) having AD (N = 21, mean age: 84.2 years). Every participant underwent blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and questionnaires about lifestyle and cognitive function. With transcriptome analysis, differential gene expressions in the blood of the three groups were evaluated by gene ontology, pathway enrichment, and ingenuity pathway analyses, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed. RESULTS: Neutrophil extracellular trap signaling was increased, and lipid metabolism (FXR/RXR activation, triacylglycerol degradation) was decreased in AD, whereas MCI showed protective responses via decreased neutrophil extracellular trap signaling and mitochondrial functions such as upregulation of the sirtuin pathway and downregulation of oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings and consistent with other published studies, immune cells appear to have important roles in the pathogenesis of AD, and the transcriptome in blood may be useful as a biomarker for diagnosis via monitoring immunity in MCI and AD.",

OBJECTIVE: This study fills a gap of knowledge by examining the associations among employment, civic engagement, and leisure activities and cognitive health by the presence of APOE ε4 allele, an established risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Using pooled data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Psychosocial and Lifestyle Questionnaires (2010-2016) and the HRS data on APOE ε4 alleles, linear regression models with a lagged dependent variable were performed to examine associations between productive or leisure activities and cognitive functioning at the follow-up time point, as well as the role of APOE ε4 in these associations. RESULTS: Among all participants, employment, low or high-intensity volunteering, and cognitive/social leisure activities were associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning. The presence of at least one ε4 allele was related to poorer cognitive functioning at the follow-up time point. Among people without the APOE ε4 allele, employment, high-intensity volunteering, and cognitive/social leisure activities were significantly associated with cognitive functioning. Among people with at least one APOE ε4 allele, low-intensity volunteering and cognitive/physical leisure activities were significantly associated with better cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: We found that employment, civic engagement, and leisure activities all contribute to cognitive health, although the benefits may be restricted to low-intensity volunteering and cognitive/physical leisure activities among individuals with at least one APOE ε4 allele, who are known to be inherently at a greater risk of AD, highlighting an avenue to a relatively easily implementable strategy to promote cognitive health in this subpopulation.",

OBJECTIVE: This study systematically evaluated the impact of probiotics on cognitive function in MCI and AD through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs (January 2000-January 2024) on probiotic interventions lasting 8-24 weeks. Cognitive outcomes included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), language, naming, visual-spatial, memory, and attention. Data were analyzed using R with a random-effects model to calculate pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was rigorously assessed. RESULTS: Out of 2000 articles, 500 full texts were screened, and 10 studies were included. The meta-analysis showed varied effect sizes: MMSE (SMD: 0.28, 95%CI -0.35-0.91, p = 0.38), MoCA (SMD: 0.51, 95%CI -0.49-1.52, p = 0.33), language (SMD: -0.12, 95% CI -0.54-0.29, p = 0.56), naming (SMD: 0.02, 95%CI -0.69-0.74, p = 0.95), visual-spatial (SMD: 0.38, 95%CI -0.13-0.88, p = 0.14), memory (SMD: 0.20, 95%CI -0.15-0.55, p = 0.26), and attention (SMD: -0.07, 95%CI -0.44-0.30, p = 0.71). Positive SMDs suggest cognitive improvement, while non-significant negative SMDs indicate trends toward decline, inclined by probiotic strains, duration, and participant characteristics.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Correctly diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for patient selection in drug discovery. Research outcomes on stage diagnosis using neuroimages combined with cerebrospinal fluid and genetic biomarkers are expensive and time-consuming. Only structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scans from two internationally recognized datasets are employed as input as well as test and independent validation to determine the classification of dementia by the machine learning algorithm. OBJECTIVE: We extract the reduced dimensional latent feature vector from the sMRI scans using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The objective is to classify AD, MCI, and control (CN) using MRI and without any other information. METHODS: The extracted feature vectors from MRI scans by VAE are used as input conditions for different advanced machine-learning classifiers. Classification of AD/CN/MCI are conducted using the output of VAE from MRI images and different artificial intelligence/machine learning classifier models in two cohorts. RESULTS: Using only MRI scans, the primary goal of the study is to test the ability to classify AD from CN and MCI cases. The current study achieved classification accuracies of AD versus CN 75.45% (F1-score = 79.52%), AD versus MCI 81.41% (F1-Score = 87.06%), and autopsy-confirmed AD versus MCI 92.75% (F1-Score = 95.52%) in test sets and AD versus CN 86.16% (F1-score = 92.03%) and AD versus MCI 70.03% (F1-Score = 82.1%) in validation data set.

Corticobasal syndrome is characterized by asymmetrical involuntary movements, rigidity, apraxia, tremor, dystonia, and cortical sensory deficits. OBJECTIVE: We present the case of a 59-year-old patient with a frontotemporal presentation and parkinsonism linked to progranulin gene deletion. We also report the clinical workup needed to reach the diagnosis. METHODS: Clinical, neuropsychological, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-Flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET), dopamine-transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, electroencephalography, and genetic evaluations were conducted. RESULTS: Our patient presented initially with executive and mnesic deficits along with the presence of apathy and loss of autonomy. Subsequently the cognitive deficits became associated with parkinsonian-like movement disorders and apraxia. Structural images showed right onset temporal and insular atrophy, and the PET images demonstrated right frontotemporal hypometabolism and the absence of amyloid in the cortex. The molecular analysis revealed a heterozygous deletion c.813_816delCACT on the GRN gene. This variant has been reported in the literature as pathogenic and associated with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and corticobasal degeneration. Our patient presented different clinical features than those of the members of the families already described. In these families, some patients either presented immediately with motor syndrome with extrapyramidal features, or never developed extrapyramidal signs. Some subjects presented prevalent language dysfunction while others never presented memory disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical case highlights the phenotypic variability of this entity.",

Indian medicinal herbs notably, Withania somnifera, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, and Clitoria ternatea are traditionally utilized for their memory-enhancing properties. OBJECTIVE: We computationally investigated the therapeutic potential of four nootropic herbs by uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying their treatment for AD. METHODS: Cheminformatics, pharmacokinetics, and system pharmacology studies were carried out to predict the phytocompounds drug-like properties, protein targets, targets functional association and enrichment analysis. A comparative study was performed with phytocompounds and FDA-approved drugs. Investigation on the expression of protein targets in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of the AD brain was performed. Network was constructed to depict the interaction between phytocompounds, drugs, and molecular targets. RESULTS: Through comparative analysis, we found that the phytocompounds shared common targets with both FDA drugs and drugs under clinical trials. We identified potential active compounds notably, Withaferin A, Withanolide-D, Withanolide-E, Withanolide-G, and Humulene epoxide II, that can combat AD. Interestingly, the enzyme inhibition scores of the identified drugs were much higher than FDA-approved drugs. In addition, regulatory proteins such as AβPP, acetylcholinesterase, BACE1, and PTPN1 were the targets of 8, 16, 9, and 22 phytocompounds, respectively. Nonetheless, AR and CYP19A, were the primary targets of most phytocompounds.

We previously reported that Centella asiatica herb water extract (CAW) attenuates cognitive decline in murine models of AD and aging. OBJECTIVE: To explore changes in the hippocampal metabolome associated with CAW's modulation of cognitive function and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque load in aged Tg2576 and wild-type (WT) mice. METHODS: We compared cognitive function, hippocampal Aβ plaque burden, and hippocampal metabolite profile in 20-month-old Tg2576 female mice and their WT littermates following 3-5 weeks treatment with CAW (0, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/d p.o.). Cognitive testing included contextual fear response (CFR) and novel object recognition task (NORT). Aβ plaque burden was measured via immunohistochemistry. Metabolomic profiles of mouse hippocampi were obtained using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: CAW treatment resulted in dose-related improvements in CFR and NORT performance of Tg2576 and WT mice. However, while CFR correlated with neurosignaling and glycosylated ceramide levels, NORT performance correlated with lysophosphatidylcholines and oxidized metabolites, and Aβ accumulation was linked to elevated excitatory and suppressed inhibitory neurotransmission. Only a subset of the metabolite changes induced by CAW in Tg2576 mice represented a reversal of metabolite differences between Tg2576 and WT mice, suggesting the involvement of other pathways in CAW's cognitive effects. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms underlying CAW's cognitive effects extend beyond reversing metabolic effects of Aβ accumulation. The data support the potential use of CAW to manage memory challenges in aged individuals with or without AD.",

Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze assessment tools for cognitive function using the Consensus Criteria for Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) method. Comparing the validity, reliability, and practicality of these assessment tools helps clinicians select appropriate assessment tools for patients, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. Methods:We followed the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and used the COSMIN checklist to conduct a thorough methodological quality assessment of the studies. The measurement properties were evaluated and rated on a scale from excellent to poor, based on adapted criteria. We then synthesized the best evidence by combining the COSMIN outcomes with the quality of findings to ensure a precise and comprehensive analysis. Results: We identified a total of 156 publications, which included 19 different cognitive assessment instruments. Among these, the Telephone version of the Cantonese Mini-Mental State Examination (T-CMMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Hong Kong versions of the MoCA (HK-MoCA-A1 and A2) demonstrated distinguished qualities. The assessment of measurement properties included internal consistency, reliability, validity, and sensitivity and specificity.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: In the sporadic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ) administration, cognitive impairment is accompanied by specific astrocytic changes in the hippocampus prior to amyloid deposition. OBJECTIVE: Hypothesizing that the synthesis of GABA, via MAO-B, contributes to ammonia elevation, thereby compromising antioxidant defense and ATP synthesis, and possibly contributing to cognitive damage, we determined the hippocampal levels of glutamine synthetase (GS), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and other enzymes related to GABA metabolism. METHODS: Immunoblotting and RT-PCR assays were carried out in hippocampal samples of Wistar rats, at 4 and 16 weeks post-STZ, in the sporadic STZ-induced AD model, corresponding to the pre-amyloid and amyloid phases, respectively. RESULTS: We observed a reduction in GS activity and increased MAO-B content, both in 4 weeks and in 16 weeks, reinforcing the idea that astroglial dysfunction precedes the amyloid phase. These alterations were accompanied by an increase in the content of ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), which catalyzes the synthesis of putrescine (substrate for GABA synthesis, via MAO-B), and a reduction in the gene expression of arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of creatine, and in the generation of GABA agonists. These changes were only seen in the amyloid phase of the AD model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to explain the greater damage that occurs in energy metabolism at this stage, in addition to the greater GABAergic loss. The changes reinforce the importance of the STZ model and further our understanding of the changes in both AD phases.",

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers a potential alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of DBS versus conservative treatment in patients with severe AD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with severe AD diagnosed at the People's Liberation Army General Hospital from 2015 to 2022. Twenty patients received DBS, and twenty received conservative treatment. Treatment effects were assessed using standardized scales at three- and twelve-months post-treatment. Primary outcomes included changes in cognitive function [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale-Cognitive subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, sleep quality, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver burden (Barthel Index, Functional Activity Questionnaire, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PDQI), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)]. RESULTS: DBS patients showed significantly greater improvements in MMSE, MoCA, FIM, and ZBI scores than controls, suggesting improved cognitive function and quality of life, and reduced caregiver burden (p < 0.05). Notably, DBS significantly reduced HAM-A, HAM-D, and PSQI scores, and improved NPI scores more than controls, indicating significant amelioration of neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DBS is a safe and reversible treatment that potentially enhances cognitive function and quality of life in severe AD patients and alleviates caregiver burden. For the first time, we report that DBS also improves neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders, highlighting its clinical potential in AD.",

Most dementias are complex phenotypes that result from a genome-environment interplay. Epigenetic regulation has emerged as a candidate mechanism for studying this interplay. In this narrative review, we discuss state-of-the-art evidence on environmental exposures relevant to dementia, including nutrition, physical exercise, psychosocial stress, and environmental toxins, and highlight epigenetic mechanisms that have been reported as a putative link between each exposure and dementia risk. We then discuss the clinical implications and future directions of this line of research. An improved understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in dementia pathogenesis can promote the development of novel biomarkers for predicting outcomes but also targeted therapies to intervene early in the course of the disease.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) are significant concerns among the elderly, sharing overlapping risk factors. Hawaii's unique demographic profile, characterized by its strong ethnic diversity, shows marked racial health disparities. For instance, the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI) population is identified as a high-risk group for multiple health conditions, including CVD. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of AD on the risk of developing CVD, with a focus on racial influences, utilizing Hawaii Medicare data. METHODS: Employing nine years of longitudinal Hawaii Medicare data, this study identified elderly patients diagnosed with AD who subsequently developed heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or stroke. To assess the risk of CVD, we utilized multistate models and employed propensity score-matched controls. Additionally, we evaluated racial and ethnic differences in the risk of these diseases, while accounting for other relevant risk factors. RESULTS: Our findings revealed an elevated risk of AMI, HF, and IHD among individuals diagnosed with AD. Additionally, socioeconomic status (SE) was identified as a crucial factor in the risk of cardio and cerebrovascular diseases. Within the low SE group, NHPIs exhibited increased risks of HF and IHD compared to their white counterparts. Interestingly, NHPIs demonstrated reduced risks of HF in the higher SE group. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of AD increases the likelihood of developing AMI, HF, and IHD. Moreover, the risk of CVD appears to be influenced by race/ethnicity in Hawaii, as well as socioeconomic status.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory, language, and cognitive functions and currently has no definitive cure. Saraswata Ghrita (SG), a traditional Ayurvedic remedy administered nasally, offers a holistic approach and is believed to directly affect brain functions through its unique delivery route. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SG in improving cognitive function and neurochemical biomarkers in a patient with AD. Key outcomes included electroencephalography-based excitation/inhibition (fE/I) ratio, and levels of phosphorylated Tau-181 (pTau-181), serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). METHODS: A 90-day proof-of-concept clinical trial was conducted with one AD patient. Nasal administration of SG was performed twice daily. Measurements included EEG spectral power analysis across 1-48 Hz, cognitive function assessed by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) scales, and biochemical analyses of pTau-181, serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and DHEA. RESULTS: Notable improvements were observed: ADAS-Cog score decreased from 40 to 36, QoL-AD score increased from 23 to 31, MMSE score improved from 13 to 18, and MoCA score increased from 8 to 13. Biochemical markers showed a decrease in pTau-181 (12.50 pg/ml to 6.28 pg/ml), an increase in acetylcholine (13.73 pg/ml to 31.83 pg/ml), while serotonin and DHEA levels rose, and dopamine levels decreased (39.14 pg/ml to 36.21 pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: SG demonstrated potential in enhancing cognitive functions and neurochemical markers in AD, with the nasal route proving safe and effective.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool for dose optimization (DO) whereby treatment is adjusted based on previous quantification of the prescribed drug. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether TDM-based DO of donepezil or memantine improves clinical outcomes and/or reduce the frequency of adverse reactions (ARs) in neurodegenerative conditions commonly treated with these two study drugs. METHODS: Single-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled study in an outpatient memory clinic. Eligible participants either newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) scheduled for treatment with donepezil or memantine. The intervention group received TDM based DO. The control group received DO solely based on clinical assessment. Clinical outcomes were change in Mini-Mental State Examination, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Disability Assessment in Dementia from baseline to 12 months. Additionally, data on incidence and severity of ARs and proportion of participants with a serum concentration within the therapeutic reference range were collected. RESULTS: 132 participants recruited (125 AD, 7 DLB, none with PDD) of whom 107 completed the study (101 AD and 6 DLB), fewer in the control group than planned. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences between groups neither for clinical outcomes nor for frequency of ARs. CONCLUSIONS: TDM based DO did not significantly improve clinical outcomes nor reduce the frequency of ARs albeit important caveats to the results apply.

Understanding these overlaps may aid in identifying common diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVE: This study identifies shared diagnostic genes and mechanisms linking AD and VaD. METHODS: Datasets GSE5281 and GSE122063 from the GEO database were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Intersection DEGs were analyzed using KEGG and GO enrichment to explore signaling pathways. A PPI network was constructed, and LASSO and SVM-RFE were applied to identify core genes. CIBERSORT assessed immune cell composition and their relationship with core genes. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using ROC curves, nomogram, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Core genes were used to identify characteristic genes in various brain regions of AD patients. RESULTS: The analysis identified 9021 DEGs for AD and 373 DEGs for VaD, with 74 co-expressed genes and 8 core genes. ROC curves, nomogram, and DCA indicated high diagnostic accuracy. Core gene analysis revealed differential expression of characteristic genes in various brain regions of AD patients. CONCLUSIONS: This research identified 74 co-expressed genes and 8 pivotal diagnostic genes. These genes likely play roles in signal transduction, neuroinflammation, and autophagy in both AD and VaD. The findings offer potential targets for future research and clinical interventions. Further research should use larger, more diverse datasets and incorporate custom NGS panels to identify novel genetic variants, enhancing precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

Both high impact pain and AD have been previously associated with differences in the epigenome. Interactions with the epigenome may serve as a possible underlying mechanism linking high impact pain and AD. OBJECTIVE: To complete epigenetic canonical pathways analyses related to AD in individuals with and without high-impact knee pain. METHODS: This manuscript aimed to explore differences in DNA methylation patterns in genes and pathways associated with AD. Blood samples of cognitively intact, community-dwelling adults with high impact knee painmversus pain-free controls were compared on their DNA methylation levels of AD-related genes. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on significantly different DNA Methylation probes by pain group. RESULTS: There were significant DNA methylation differences between the high impact versus the pain-free control groups in genes and pathways associated with AD (p < 0.05). We found a total of 17,563 differentially methylated CpG probes, including 13,411 hypermethylated CpG probes and 4152 hypomethylated CpG probes. Further, pathway analysis revealed these differences were significantly associated with AD-related pathways associated with AD progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study sample showed AD-related DNA methylation differences and associated potential canonical pathways in those with and without high impact knee pain. These results highlight the need to study overlapping epigenetic modifications underlying high impact pain and AD pathologies. Further studies, including gene expression, are needed to further explore the relationship between epigenetics, chronic pain, and AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Brain atrophy is one of the most common features of neurodegenerative diseases and is particularly critical in the early diagnosis of conditions like Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Automated segmentation and quantification are highly desirable in brain atrophy evaluation but existing methods require high-quality MRI scans with isotropic resolution. However in practice, clinicians usually choose to reduce the number of slices to save time, and because of their anisotropic resolution, the morphometric analysis cannot be implemented. Here we propose the use of an inter-slice interpolation network to increase spatial resolution to isotropic to accomplish morphometric analysis of brain atrophy, which is not feasible to perform with clinical scans. To achieve fully automated quantification, we set up a series of indicators that cover multiple aspects such as holistic and localized, structural and cortical, based on our clinical experience. As a result, a fully automated diagnostic process for pathological brain atrophy is completed. Our results on the IXI and ADNI datasets show that the slice spacing method produces realistic and reliable anatomy and achieves high diagnostic accuracy, and our indicators are well suited to clinical application scenarios.",

However, neuronal activity in the hippocampus is difficult to monitor and study in human AD patients. Thus, it is critical to have an animal model that resembles closely human AD. The newly developed APPNL-G-F rat model, which is a knock-in rat line of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with Swedish-Beyreuther/Iberian-Arctic mutations, presents a unique opportunity. In this study, we investigated how hippocampal place cells and neural rhythms were impaired in APP rats. Place cells of APP rats showed a less defined spatial tunning and disrupted remapping. In addition, APP rats exhibited decreased power of theta rhythm and slow gamma rhythm. These results suggest that the impairment of spatial memory in APP rats may be caused by the damage of place cells' ability to represent spatial location and abnormal neural rhythm in the hippocampus.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Uni-AdaFocus: Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Computation for Video Recognition.",
    "AbstractText": "This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data redundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational efficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The complete model can be trained conveniently in an end-to-end manner. During inference, once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation can be executed in parallel, rendering it efficient on modern GPU devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AdaFocus can be easily extended by further considering the temporal and sample- wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant video frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively \"easier\" videos. Our resulting algorithm, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample- wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf backbone models (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven widely-used benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, Jester, and Kinetics-400) and three real-world application scenarios (i.e., fine-grained diving action classification, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases diagnosis with brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), and violence recognition for online videos) substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.

This integration introduces a new paradigm in AI-driven medical imaging, particularly in assessing brain age'a crucial marker for detecting age-related neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI (sMRI), incorporating functional MRI (fMRI) data presents significant challenges due to its complex data structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address these challenges, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (M-AVAE), a bespoke deep learning framework designed to enhance brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. The M-AVAE uniquely separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, effectively isolating shared and modality-specific features. Additionally, integrating multitask learning with sex classification as a supplementary task enables the model to account for sex-specific aging nuances. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset'a comprehensive multisite brain MRI aggregation-the M-AVAE demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, surpassing conventional methodologies.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis used six cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey linked to the Canadian Vital Statistics Database (2000-2017). The cohort comprised 500 870 adults (18-74 years). Predictors included sociodemographic factors, self-perceived measures, health behaviours and chronic conditions. Three models (minimal, primary and full) were developed. PreMPoRT was internally validated using a split set approach and externally validated across three hold-out cycles. Performance was assessed based on predictive accuracy, discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: The cohort included 267 460 females and 233 410 males. Premature deaths occurred in 1.40% of females and 2.05% of males. Primary models had 12 predictors (females) and 13 predictors (males). Shared predictors included age, income quintile, education, self-perceived health, smoking, emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and stroke. Male-specific predictors were marital status, Alzheimer's disease and arthritis while female-specific predictors were body mass index and physical activity. External validation cohort differed slightly in demographics. Female model performance: split set (c-statistic: 0.852), external (c-statistic: 0.856). Male model performance: split set and external (c-statistic: 0.846). Calibration showed slight overprediction for high-risk individuals and good calibration in key subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: PreMPoRT achieved the strongest discrimination and calibration among existing prediction models for premature mortality.

One of the symptoms that greatly reduces the quality of daily functioning is the deterioration of spatial orientation abilities. A non-pharmacological treatment option for Alzheimer's disease, which is also employed to improve the cognitive functioning of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, is virtual reality training. OBJECTIVE: To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no existing systematic review on the use of virtual reality training to enhance spatial orientation in individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. The review was therefore conducted to fill this gap. The findings of this review may support the efficacy of virtual reality in enhancing spatial orientation. METHODS: Five databases were searched. The primary inclusion criteria were study participants aged over 60 years with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment and the use of virtual reality for improving spatial orientation. Six studies meeting these criteria were ultimately included in the review. RESULTS: All included studies demonstrated an improvement in the spatial orientation of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment following virtual reality training. This indicates the effectiveness of virtual reality technology in cognitive rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: As virtual reality cognitive training has proven effective, its use should be more widely adopted. Further research on the application of virtual reality for enhancing spatial orientation in individuals with dementia is recommended.",

    "ArticleTitle": "PROFILE AND PATTERN OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY ONSET DEMENTIA ATTENDING A PSYCHOGERIATRIC CLINIC IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA: A RETROSPECTIVE CASE SERIES.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Accessing data on the profile and pattern of people diagnosed with early onset dementia (EOD) can be challenging, especially in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries. Research focused on the epidemiology of EOD will improve early detection and diagnosis, and the understanding of its impact on individuals and society. OBJECTIVE: The study seeks to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of people diagnosed with EOD in an outpatient memory clinic. METHOD: A retrospective quantitative case series to investigate the pattern and characteristics of people diagnosed with EOD attending a Psychogeriatric Clinic in Southwestern Nigeria. Data were collected manually from the medical case records of people with dementia who attended the psychogeriatric clinic. RESULTS: The subjects' mean ± SD age was 60.2 ± 4.2 years and 50% were females. The most common medical comorbidity was hypertension (50.0%). Depression (15.8%) was the most common behavioral symptom. Alzheimer's dementia (50.0%) was the predominant dementia type. There was a significant difference in the age (p=0.001), Boston naming test (p=0.011), based on the educational status of the participants. The neuropsychological profile of the participants showed low scores in some specific domains like memory and language. CONCLUSION: Depression and hypertension are major comorbid conditions affecting persons with EOD. Such persons are impaired in some specific domains such as memory and language skills. Early detection and management of both conditions could have a positive impact on the overall management of Early-Onset Dementia.",

In this study, we assessed the interdependence between brain regions in patients with early-stage dementia based on phase-lock values, and constructed a functional brain network, selecting network feature parameters for metrics based on complex network analysis methods. At the same time, the entropy information characterizing the EEG signals in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain, as well as the nonlinear dynamics features such as Hjorth and Hurst indexes were extracted, respectively. Based on the statistical analysis, the feature parameters with significant differences between different conditions were screened to construct feature vectors, and finally multiple machine learning algorithms were used to realize the recognition of early categories of dementia patients. The results showed that the fusion of multiple features performed well in the categorization of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobe dementia and healthy controls, especially in the identification of Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls, the accuracy of β-band reached 98%, which showed its effectiveness. This study provides new ideas for the early diagnosis of dementia and computer-assisted diagnostic methods.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD), a continuous disease spectrum, includes the symptomatic stages of the period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the dementia period, also known as AD dementia. Focusing on MCI and AD dementia screening, i.e., AD spectrum screening, we analyzed the value of plasma biomarkers for diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in the local populations of Deyang City, Sichuan Province, China to provide evidence for the early screening and diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted between August 2023 and October 2023 among people aged 50 years or older in Deyang City, Sichuan Province. The survey covered demographic information, information on medical history, and cognitive function assessment. Subjects with MCI were included in the MCI group, those with AD dementia were included in the AD group, and the others were included in the healthy controls (HC) group. A partial sample, including all patients with AD dementia and a randomized sample of MCI patients and HC, was drawn. Then, the plasma levels of four cognition-related biomarkers, including phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217), were measured using an ultrasensitive digital chip immunoassay technology independently developed in China. Amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) using Aβ molecular probes in all AD dementia patients and some of the MCI patients. The diagnostic value of the plasma biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 2833 subjects were investigated, including 30 (1.1%) with AD dementia, 437 (15.4%) with MCI, and 2366 (83.5%) with HC. We measured the plasma levels of 4 biomarkers of 30 AD dementia patients, 50 MCI patients, and 35 HC. Plasma p-tau217 performed best in differentiating AD dementia from HC and MCI, with the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curves being 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87-0.98), respectively. Plasma p-tau217 levels in the AD dementia, MCI, and HC groups were (2.32±1.27), (0.54±0.45), and (0.42±0.19) pg/mL, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.0001). A total of 36 patients underwent Aβ PET examination. Plasma p-tau217 showed the best performance in the diagnosis of Aβ deposition (AUC: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.96-1.00). Plasma p-tau217 levels were higher in Aβ-deposition-positive patients ([2.52±1.17] pg/mL) than those in Aβ-deposition-negative patients ([0.53±0.19] pg/mL), and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.0001). Plasma p-tau217 levels were significantly and positively correlated with Aβ PET uptake values in multiple brain regions of the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes (r>0.70, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers measured with a technology independently developed in China demonstrate good performance in diagnosing AD dementia. Plasma p-tau217, in particular, demonstrates the highest diagnostic value and can be used for AD dementia screening of large populations.",

    "AbstractText": "By using hyperpolarized 13C labeling technology, the magnetic resonance signals of 13C-labeled metabolic substrates are enhanced, which enables the in vivo monitoring of their metabolic states through magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Compared with traditional non-invasive metabolic diagnostic technologies, hyperpolarized 13C technology exhibits a number of strengths, including real-time monitoring, high precision, non-invasiveness, the absence of radiation, and the ability to assess a broader range of metabolic pathways, showing great potential for application in the treatment of glioma, stroke, Alzheimer disease, and cerebral injury. Following the approval of [1-13C]-pyruvate for clinical trials by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there has been growing academic interest in this technology. Currently, the primary challenge lies in creating more probes and promoting their clinical applications. Herein, we outlined the principles of hyperpolarized 13C labeling technology, examined its current role in neurological metabolic diagnostics, and explored the future directions, including conducting hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology at higher magnetic field strengths (such as 7T), designing additional magnetic resonance sequences specific to hyperpolarized 13C MRS, and its integration with other neuro-metabolic diagnostic methods.",

    "AbstractText": "Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), intracranial signal abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), represent one of the main adverse events associated with treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) with anti-amyloid-β (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases, patients' lives may be threatened. As the first anti-Aβ antibody was approved for use in China, clinical departments are now confronted with an increased likelihood of encountering ARIA in real-world scenarios. Accurate pre-treatment risk assessment, timely identification during medication, and severity evaluation of ARIA are of great significance in guiding clinical decisions. The identification and assessment of ARIA can be conducted from two perspectives-imaging and clinical symptoms. This article focuses on imaging. We reviewed the pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and imaging protocols and assessment of ARIA. We also stated at the end of the review that most current research data on ARIA came from clinical drug trials involving Caucasian populations, and that there was a lack of treatment experience in the real-world application of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in Chinese populations. Many issues concerning pre-treatment risk assessment still need to be explored. Additionally, whether there are other clinical factors and imaging indicators that can help predict drug risks, and whether using different imaging protocols can help make a difference in patient management in the real world all require further investigation.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Increased stress is a proposed risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined cross-sectional associations between circulating stress biomarkers and multimodal measures of brain health and cognition susceptible to AD in older adults and sex-specific subgroups. METHODS: Baseline data from 132 cognitively unimpaired participants without depression (age, mean ± SD = 74.0 ± 4.0 years, women: n = 80) in the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819) were included. Stress hormone levels were measured in overnight fasting blood serum (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and blood plasma (epinephrine, norepinephrine) samples. AD-sensitive measures of brain health, including glucose metabolism (n = 89), cerebral perfusion, gray matter volume, amyloid deposition in a priori regions of interest, and cognitive markers were evaluated. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Higher epinephrine levels were associated (false discovery rate-corrected p < .05) with lower glucose metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex (β = -0.26, p = .008), posterior cingulate cortex (β = -0.32, p = .006), and precuneus (β = -0.27, p = .021) and lower perfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex (β = -0.23, p = .013). Interactions between stress hormones and sex showed (false discovery rate-corrected p < .05) that in women only, higher epinephrine was associated with larger anterior cingulate cortex volume (interaction: β = 0.32, p = .016), whereas in men only, higher cortisol was associated with lower episodic memory performance (interaction: β = 0.98, p = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates the involvement of circulating stress hormones, particularly epinephrine and cortisol, in greater resilience or vulnerability of brain health and cognitive indicators of susceptibility to AD in older adults. The identification of sex-specific patterns in these associations may inform the development of more effective and tailored interventions.",

    "ArticleTitle": "INTEGRATING MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION WITH CAUSAL MEDIATION ANALYSES FOR CHARACTERIZING DIRECT AND INDIRECT EXPOSURE-TO-OUTCOME EFFECTS.",
    "AbstractText": "Mendelian randomization (MR) assesses the total effect of exposure on outcome. With the rapidly increasing availability of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), MR leverages existing summary statistics and is widely used to study the causal effects among complex traits and diseases. The total effect in the population is a sum of indirect and direct effects. For complex disease outcomes with complicated etiologies, and/or for modifiable exposure traits, there may exist more than one pathway between exposure and outcome. The direct effect and the indirect effect via a mediator of interest could be of opposite directions, and the total effect estimates may not be informative for treatment and prevention decision-making or may be even misleading for different subgroups of patients. Causal mediation analysis delineates the indirect effect of exposure on outcome operating through the mediator and the direct effect transmitted through other mechanisms. However, causal mediation analysis often requires individual-level data measured on exposure, outcome, mediator and confounding variables, and the power of the mediation analysis is restricted by sample size. In this work, motivated by a study of the effects of atrial fibrillation (AF) on Alzheimer's dementia, we propose a framework for Integrative Mendelian randomization and Mediation Analysis (IMMA). The proposed method integrates the total effect estimates from MR analyses based on large-scale GWASs with the direct and indirect effect estimates from mediation analysis based on individual-level data of a limited sample size. We introduce a series of IMMA models, under the scenarios with or without exposure-mediator interaction and/or study heterogeneity. The proposed IMMA models improve the estimation and the power of inference on the direct and indirect effects in the population, as well as the characterization of the variation of effects. Our analyses showed a significant positive direct effect of AF on Alzheimer's dementia risk not through the use of the oral anticoagulant treatment and a significant indirect effect of AF-induced anticoagulant treatment in reducing Alzheimer's dementia risk. The results suggested potential Alzheimer's dementia risk prediction and prevention strategies for AF patients, and paved the way for future re-evaluation of anticoagulant treatment guidelines for AF patients. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the sensitivity of the conclusions to a key assumption of the IMMA approach.",

    "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive breakdown of neuronal structure and function and the pathological accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates and toxic protein oligomers. A major contributor to the deterioration of neuronal physiology is the disruption of protein catabolic pathways mediated by the proteasome, a large protease complex responsible for most cellular protein degradation. Previously, it was believed that proteolysis by the proteasome required tagging of protein targets with polyubiquitin chains, a pathway called the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Because of this, most research on proteasomal roles in neurodegeneration has historically focused on the UPS. However, additional ubiquitin-independent pathways and their importance in neurodegeneration are increasingly recognized. In this review, we discuss the range of ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathways, focusing on substrate identification and targeting, regulatory molecules and adaptors, proteasome activators and alternative caps, and diverse proteasome complexes including the 20S proteasome, the neuronal membrane proteasome, the immunoproteasome, extracellular proteasomes, and hybrid proteasomes. These pathways are further discussed in the context of aging, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, with a special focus on Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. A mechanistic understanding of ubiquitin-independent proteasome function and regulation in neurodegeneration is critical for the development of therapies to treat these devastating conditions. This review summarizes the current state of ubiquitin-independent proteasome research in neurodegeneration.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) pose a significant and escalating global public health challenge, particularly among the aging populations. Emerging evidence has identified high fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) as a major modifiable risk factor for ADOD, linking impaired glucose metabolism to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Despite this association, the comprehensive impact of HFPG on the global burden of ADOD has not been fully elucidated. Understanding the extent to which HFPG contributes to ADOD is crucial for developing targeted interventions and optimizing healthcare resource allocation to address this growing concern. METHODS: Using Global Burden of Disease data (GBD 2021), we analyzed the global HFPG-related ADOD burden from 1990 to 2021 using an age-period-cohort framework and predicted trends for 2050. A Shiny platform was developed to visualize the disease burden and trends across 204 countries and regions. RESULTS: In 2021, approximately 15% of ADOD deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributed to HFPG, a 271.05% increase from 1990. The incidence rate rose from 47.07 to 66.42, indicating poor control. The mortality rate from HFPG-ADOD increased by 305.81%. The primary burden was among the 80-84 age group. Trends in ASDR and ASMR showed an increase across most SDI regions, except Low SDI. Decomposition analysis and the APC model indicated poor control in high SDI regions due to aging populations over the past 5 years. By 2050, the global prevalence is projected to reach 1,003,018.047 (26124.40377, 12114480.49), with 345,342.5738 (1431.57781, 6022119.213) males and 657,675.4731 (24692.82596, 6092361.28) females. The Shiny platform predicts a yearly increase in ASDR and ASMR for HFPG-ADOD in China, which is consistent with GBD platform trends. The platform is accessible at http://116.196.73.86:3838/GBD/HFPG-ADOD/. CONCLUSION: The global burden of HFPG-related ADOD has been increasing, even in high SDI regions, over the past 5 years and is expected to continue rising until 2050. Implementing appropriate health policies to mitigate this trend could significantly reduce the substantial burden caused by HFPG-induced ADOD. Promoting the use of the Shiny prediction platform will contribute significantly to global healthy aging.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: With the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increasing exponentially, there has been a shift in the focus of drug discovery for AD from treating the symptoms to preventing the development of the disease. Several natural compounds are extensively studied as neuroprotectives in preventing disease progression. Helianthus annuus seed oil (HA) is widely used as cooking oil and is abundant in antioxidant activity. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of HA in mice model of scopolamine-induced amnesia and explored the potential underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Twenty-four male mice were administered orally with either distilled water (control and scopolamine groups) or treatment groups (HA 100 and HA 200 mg/kg) for 8 consecutive days. All groups, except the control group, received an intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Subsequently, novel object recognition task for cognition assessment and open field tests for locomotory activity were performed. In addition, network analysis was performed to identify the key bioactives and targets of HA against AD. Further, the binding affinity of HA bioactives to the key targets was verified by molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: HA (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated recognition memory compared to the scopolamine group, suggesting the protective effect of HA against cognitive impairment. Network analysis indicated that the key bioactives of HA, chlorogenic acid, and oleic acid act through multiple targets and pathways, particularly the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, to ameliorate AD symptoms. Importantly, chlorogenic acid showed good binding affinity with MAPKs, TP53, and EP300. CONCLUSION: HA has therapeutic benefits in AD acting through the MAPK pathway. However, further studies need to be done to confirm the results derived and translate the potential use of HA as a dietary supplement for preventing AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most commonly occurring neurodegenerative disease. However, current diagnostics for AD primarily rely on invasive tests, which limit the application of diagnostic procedures in early screening. Speech, as a noninvasive biomarker, is closely associated with AD but has not been fully leveraged as a diagnostic tool. This study develops a novel early AD diagnosis method that uses primitive speech and explores its potential application in community screening. Moreover, the study proposes an innovative multimodal method for speech feature fusion that combines acoustic and semantic information to differentiate patients with AD from normal controls. This method uses the ImageBind audio encoder to extract acoustic features and the Embeddings from Language Model to extract semantic features, thereby effectively integrating the features by mid-level fusion. The training set comprises 166 speech recordings, which comprise 87 samples from individuals with AD and 79 samples from healthy control subjects. The ratio of training set to test set is 7:3. Evaluation of the Alzheimer dementia recognition through spontaneous speech only dataset showed that the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.903 and a recall rate of 1, and it considerably outperformed existing baseline models, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach to AD diagnosis. This study applies the multimodal fusion of speech features to an early AD diagnostic procedure and achieves excellent performance.

Therefore, our study will elucidate the mechanism of Polygonatum against AD based on network pharmacology and molecular docking. The active ingredients and corresponding targets of Polygonatum were identified using the traditional Chinese medicine systematic pharmacology database and analysis platform. Disease targets of AD were retrieved from the therapeutic target database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GeneCards, and Disgenet databases. Using the STRING database, we constructed protein interaction networks and performed gene ontology functional enrichment analysis as well as Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analysis on common targets. We then drew drug-component-target-pathway-disease network maps using Cytoscape 3.10.1 software and validated the molecular docking using AutoDock4. A total of 10 active ingredients and 108 common targets were screened from Polygonatum, 29 genes (including AKT1 and STAT3) were identified as core genes. According to gene ontology analysis, the core targets were found to be mainly involved in signal transduction, positive regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of the apoptotic process, and so on. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis revealed that the signaling pathways comprised pathways in cancer, pathways of neurodegeneration - multiple diseases, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The molecular docking results indicated that 10 of active ingredients from Polygonatum exhibited strong binding affinity with the 6 core targets that were screened before. The activity of Polygonatum against AD could be attributed to the regulation of multiple biological effects via multi-pathways (pathways in cancer, pathways of neurodegeneration - multiple diseases, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway). The binding activities were estimated as good level by molecular docking.

Traditional diagnostic tools, such as intracranial volume assessments, electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have shown utility in detecting the disease. However, artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise for automating this process, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and accessibility. METHODS: In this study, various machine learning models were used to detect Alzheimer disease, including K-nearest neighbor regression, support vector machines (SVM), AdaBoost regression, and logistic regression. A neural network was constructed and validated using data from 150 participants in the University of Washington's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Open Access Imaging Studies Series [OASIS] dataset). Cross-validation was also performed on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to assess the robustness of the models. RESULTS: Among the models tested, K-nearest neighbor regression achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 97.33%. The cross-validation on the ADNI dataset further confirmed the effectiveness of the models, demonstrating satisfactory results in screening and diagnosing Alzheimer disease in a community-based sample. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that AI-based models, particularly K-nearest neighbor regression, provide promising accuracy for the early detection of Alzheimer disease.

CLUSTERIN (CLU), a chaperone protein expressed in the brain and found in relatively high concentrations in plasma, is a promising candidate. CLU contributes to the elimination of β-amyloid (Aβ), which is associated to neurofibrillary tangles and to the genetic risk for AD. We performed a longitudinal measurement of CLU in the brain and the plasma in 3xTgAD mice. Assessment of CLU was also conducted in 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats. In humans, brain CLU was measured in non-demented and in AD subjects. The plasma CLU was longitudinally measured in four cohorts defined as healthy controls that remained stable, healthy controls that presented a cognitive decline between the two measures, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that presented a cognitive decline between the two measures and AD. A validation cohort composed of 19 MCI was used and plasma CLU was measured before and after conversion in AD. Increases in CLU were measured in the hippocampus of 3xTgAD and TgF344-AD animals in the absence of plasmatic changes. CLU is heterogeneously expressed in the hippocampus in non-demented individuals and increased in AD. In the plasma, two CLU levels were measured: low in controls and MCI, and high in AD. To validate that the elevation in CLU is associated with conversion to AD, a replication study showed, in a second group MCI patients converting to AD in the follow-up that CLU levels increased in 16/19 individuals. The increase in brain CLU occurs in AD models as in humans, and seems to precede plasma variations, which could make it an AD therapeutic target. Plasma CLU seems to be a promising marker of cognitive decline, and its association with AD may be a useful complementary diagnostic tool.",

Furthermore, increased astrocytic NHE1 protein and GFAP protein were detected in proximity to amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques in APP mouse brains. We then tested the efficacy of pharmacological NHE1 inhibition using its inhibitor, HOE642, in attenuating pathogenesis in APP mice. Vehicle-treated APP mice (APP.Veh) exhibited hyperactive locomotor behavior at 4-months and 7-months of age, compared to wild-type littermates (WT.Veh). In contrast, APP mice-treated with HOE642 (APP.HOE) displayed significantly lower hyperactive locomotor behavior (p<0.01). Additionally, APP.HOE mice showed decreased density of amyloid fibrils. In summary, we detected NHE1 protein upregulation in reactive astrocytes in both AD human and APP brains. Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 protein attenuated pathological Aβ plaque density, and hyperactive locomotor behaviors in APP mice, highlighting NHE1 as a possible therapeutic target for AD.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Inducing aggresome and stable tau aggregation in Neuro2a cells with an optogenetic tool.",
    "AbstractText": "Tauopathy is a spectrum of diseases characterized by fibrillary tau aggregate formation in neurons and glial cells in the brain. Tau aggregation originates in the brainstem and entorhinal cortex and then spreads throughout the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most prevalent type of tauopathy. Understanding the mechanism by which locally developed tau pathology propagates throughout the brain is crucial for comprehending AD pathogenesis. Therefore, a novel model of tau pathology that artificially induces tau aggregation in targeted cells at specific times is essential. This study describes a novel optogenetic module, OptoTau, which is a human tau with the P301L mutation fused with a photosensitive protein CRY2olig, inducing various forms of tau according to the temporal pattern of blue light illumination pattern. Continuous blue light illumination for 12 h to Neuro2a cells that stably express OptoTau (OptoTauKI cells) formed clusters along microtubules, many of which eventually accumulated in aggresomes. Conversely, methanol-resistant tau aggregation was formed when alternating light exposure and darkness in 30-min cycles for 8 sets per day were repeated over 8 days. Methanol-resistant tau was induced more rapidly by repeating 5-min illumination followed by 25-min darkness over 24 h. These results indicate that OptoTau induced various tau aggregation stages based on the temporal pattern of blue light exposure. Thus, this technique exhibits potential as a novel approach to developing specific tau aggregation in targeted cells at desired time points.",

Significant benefits have been noted in glycemic control and cardiovascular health. However, as increasing numbers of patients are started on these medications, it is important for neurosurgeons to have knowledge of any perioperative considerations and side effects related to this class of drugs. METHODS: We performed a qualitative literature review using the PubMed and Embase databases, using the following key words: GLP-1 RAs adverse events; GLP-1 RAs and anesthesia; substance use disorders; and addiction, functional neurosurgery, nervous system rehabilitation, and spinal cord injury. Articles of relevance to perioperative management of these medications and specific benefits in the neurosurgical field were discussed. RESULTS: Recent guidance from the American Society of Anesthesiologists demonstrates the importance of tailored management of GLP-RA drugs for surgical patients. In addition, certain positive effects have been noted with relation to substance use disorders, neural protection and rehabilitation, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: In this article, we review what the neurosurgeon needs to know about the perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs and discuss existing literature in clinical and preclinical studies for potential indications and benefits of these medications, which can influence the management of conditions treated by neurosurgeons.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Multi- and polypharmacology of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",
    "AbstractText": "Eight genetically distinct families of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) have been described in organisms overall in the phylogenetic tree. They catalyze the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and protons and are involved in pH regulation, chemosensing, and metabolism. The 15 α-CA isoforms present in humans are pharmacological drug targets known for decades, their inhibitors being used as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, or antiobesity drugs, as well as for the management of acute mountain sickness, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and recently, as antitumor theragnostic agents. Other potential applications include the use of CA inhibitors (CAIs) in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or Alzheimer/Parkinson disease management. CAs from pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and nematodes have started to be considered as drug targets in recent years, with notable advances being registered. CAIs have a complex multipharmacology probably unique to this enzyme, which has been exploited intensely but may lead to other relevant applications in the future due to the emergence of drug design approaches that afforded highly isoform-selective compounds for most α-CAs known to date. They belong to a multitude of chemical classes (sulfonamides and isosteres, [iso]coumarins and related compounds, mono- and dithiocarbamates, selenols, ninhydrines, boronic acids, benzoxaboroles, etc). The polypharmacology of CAIs will also be discussed because drugs originally discovered for the treatment of non-CA related conditions (topiramate, zonisamide, celecoxib, pazopanib, thiazide, and high-ceiling diuretics) show effective inhibition against many CAs, which led to their repurposing for diverse pharmacological applications. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CAIs have multiple pharmacologic applications, such as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, antiobesity, antiacute mountain sickness, anti-idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and antitumor drugs. Their use in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or neurodegenerations has started to be investigated recently. Parasite carbonic anhydrases are also drug targets for anti-infectives with novel mechanisms of action that can bypass drug resistance to commonly used agents. Drugs discovered for the management of other conditions that effectively inhibit these enzymes exert interesting polypharmacologic effects.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Ferroptosis and pathogenesis of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Neuritic plaques are pathognomonic and terminal lesions of Alzheimer disease (AD). They embody AD pathogenesis because they harbor in one space critical pathologic features of the disease: amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary degeneration, neuroinflammation, and iron accumulation. Neuritic plaques are thought to arise from the conversion of diffuse extracellular deposits of amyloid-β protein (Aβ), and it is believed that during conversion, amyloid toxicity creates the dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques, as well as neurofibrillary tangles However, recent evidence from human postmortem studies suggests a much different mechanism of neuritic plaque formation, where the first step in their creation is neuronal degeneration driven by iron overload and ferroptosis. Similarly, neurofibrillary tangles represent the corpses of iron-laden neurons that develop independently of Aβ deposits. In this review, we will focus on the role of free redox-active iron in the development of typical AD pathology, as determined largely by evidence obtained in the human temporal lobe during early, preclinical stages of AD. The findings have allowed the construction of a scheme of AD pathogenesis where brain iron is center stage and is involved in every step of the sequence of events that produce characteristic AD pathology. We will discuss how the study of preclinical AD has produced a fresh and revised assessment of AD pathogenesis that may be important for reconsidering current therapeutic efforts and guiding future ones. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review offers a novel perspective on Alzheimer disease pathogenesis where elevated brain iron plays a central role and is involved throughout the development of lesions. Herein, we review arguments against the amyloid cascade theory and explain how recent findings in humans during early preclinical disease support iron-mediated cell death and endogenous iron containment mechanisms as critical components of neuritic plaque formation and ensuing dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of extended supplementation (≥6 weeks) with natural compounds or extracts in improving cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across Cochrane, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to April 10, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating cognitive outcomes in patients with MCI or AD using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). RESULTS: From an initial pool of 6,687 articles, 45 were deemed relevant for qualitative analysis. Of these, 37 studies demonstrated improvements or positive trends in cognitive outcomes with natural compound or extract supplementation. A total of 35 studies met the criteria for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis, involving 4,974 participants, revealed significant improvements in ADAS-Cog scores (pooled standardized mean difference = -2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.26 to -1.50; t24 = -4.31, p < 0.01) following supplementation.

We report our experience with palliative treatment for a terminal oral cancer patient with dementia who wished for home palliative care. The patient was an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and chronic heart failure. In late September 2022, he visited a nearby internal medicine clinic with complaints of loss of appetite and pain in the right maxillary gingiva and was referred to a tertiary medical institution in the prefecture for further examination and treatment. At the initial visit, a 40×30 mm easily bleeding ulcerative lesion was observed in the right maxillary molar gingiva. Based on various examinations, he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the right maxillary gingiva(cT4bN0M0, Stage ⅣB). However, due to dementia and severe cardiac dysfunction, he was not eligible for chemoradiotherapy and a plan for palliative treatment was made. The patient strongly wished for treatment at home and at a local hospital, and palliative treatment with a view to home palliative care was initiated. He was admitted to our internal medicine department in mid-November. Our department continued local treatment for the tumor and specialized oral care by a dental hygienist, but he passed away due to cardiac arrest in early January 2023. Although the patient passed away before transitioning to home care, smooth implementation of home palliative care requires cooperation not only from hospitals but also from the entire community, and the establishment of a comprehensive home medical support system is crucial.",

Tau protein aggregation, a key pathological feature of AD, is closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Targeting tau protein has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. By investigating the effects of monoclonal antibodies on cognitive function, disease progression, and overall quality of life in patients with AD, which can provide valuable insights into their potential as a therapeutic option for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of Gosuranemab, Semorinemab, Tilavonemab, and Zagotenemab in Alzheimer's disease (AD) were systematically searched across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, up to May 2024. The control group included placebo. The efficacy indicators were change in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) from baseline until the time of efficacy observation. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 14 and RevMan 5.4. The purpose of data processing, including generating network evidence plots, surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, league plots, and funnel plots, is to visually summarize and evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety and potential publication bias of multiple interventions. Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) as effect sizes to analyze continuous variables. RESULTS: This study encompassed six RCTs involving 2,193 patients. Semorinemab were more effective than placebo in MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores (MDs ranging between 0.52 and 3.21; MDs ranging between 0.17 and 3.30). Placebo showed relatively good efficacy according to SUCRA ranking on change in CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL scores (75.7 and 79.5%). Tilavonemab and Semorinemab exhibited efficacy similar to that of a placebo in the analysis of the two indicators. Tilavonemab showed a lower incidence of AE, SAE, fall, and urinary tract infections than placebo, and the differences were statistically significant. Most safety analysis results showed no statistical difference. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that anti-tau protein monoclonal antibodies, such as Semorinemab and Tilavonemab, showed promise in terms of efficacy and safety for managing AD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, assess long-term effects, and refine treatment protocols.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The potential therapeutic role of nicotine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial, particularly regarding its age-dependent effects and underlying mechanisms. METHODS: This study investigated the impact of chronic nicotine administration on cognitive function and molecular pathways in Presenilin 1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice, an amyloid-β: (Aβ:)- independent model of AD. Three-month-old and eight-month-old DKO and wild-type (WT) mice received oral nicotine treatment (100 μg/ml) for three months. Behavioral assessments revealed that while the 6-month-old cohort showed no significant differences between nicotine-treated and control groups regardless of genotype, nicotine improved contextual fear memory in 11-month- old DKO mice but impaired nest-building ability and cued fear memory in age-matched WT controls. Transcriptome analysis of the prefrontal cortex identified distinct molecular responses to nicotine between genotypes. RESULTS: In DKO mice, nicotine modulated neuropeptide signaling and reduced astrocyte activation, while in WT mice, it disrupted cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and neuroactive ligand- receptor interaction pathways. Western blot analysis revealed that nicotine treatment significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) expression in 11-month-old DKO mice, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing decreased astrocyte activation in multiple brain regions CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that nicotine's effects on cognition and molecular pathways are both age- and genotype-dependent, suggesting its therapeutic potential may be limited to specific stages of neurodegeneration while potentially having adverse effects in healthy aging brains.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: For over a decade, AMPA receptor allosteric potentiators (AMPAkines) have shown significant effectiveness in multiple preclinical studies related to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders underpinned by deficient excitatory synaptic activity. Despite promising preclinical evidence, the clinical translation of AMPAkines has been slow due to the propensity of some of these compounds to produce seizures at or around therapeutic doses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preclinical activity of the AMPAkine CX1837 is disclosed in the current work. RESULTS: CX1837 enhanced synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices in vitro and dose-dependently enhanced long-term potentiation, which is believed to control memory consolidation. CX1837 boosted performance in cognition tests, such as the novel object recognition test and the win-shift radial arm maze. CX1837 also increased attentional functioning in the 5-choice serial reaction time task in rats. CX1837 produced positive preclinical effects at 0.01-1.0 mg/kg dose and elicited epileptic effects at 10 mg/kg dose. DISCUSSION: CX1837 has one of the largest safety margins to date in preclinical studies. Low doses of CX1837, which produce acute increases in cognition, may potentially increase neurotrophins when given chronically. This could slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease and reverse deficits secondary to ischemic stroke. CONCLUSION: Together, our findings highlight CX1837 as a potential candidate for clinical development in order to treat multiple neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of cognitive decline, which leads to dementia and poses significant challenges for its therapy. The reason is primarily the ineffective available treatments targeting the underlying pathology of AD. It is a neurodegenerative disease that is mainly characterised by the various molecular pathways contributing to its complex pathology, including extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. One of the crucial features is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which is facilitated by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-4 (MARK-4). The kinase plays a crucial role in the disease development by modifying microtubule integrity, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. MARK-4 is thus a druggable target and has a pivotal role in AD. Amongst MARK-4 inhibitors, 16 compounds demonstrate significant capacity in molecular docking studies, showing high binding affinity to MARK-4 and promising potential for tau inhibition. Further, in-vitro investigations provide evidence of their neuroprotective properties. The present review mainly focuses on the role of MARK-4 and its potential inhibitors used in treating AD, which have been thoroughly investigated in silico and in vitro..",

However, in these studies, the calendar has been programmed to send cues only about the time of prospective events. METHODS: We investigated the benefits of the smartphone calendar applications sending notifications about both the time and location of the prospective events. We recruited two groups. In the first group (time-and-location-cued group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications about the time and location of prospective events, while in the second group (time-cued group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications only about the time of prospective events. In both groups, we invited patients to attend three prospective events per week during a three-week period. RESULTS: The results demonstrated fewer omissions in the time- and location-cued group than in the time-cued group. CONCLUSION: Providing patients with AD with several contextual cues through smartphone-based calendars may result in better prospective performance than providing them with only one contextual cue.",

Research has identified β-Secretase (BACE1) as a promising therapeutic target for the management of AD. BACE1 is involved in the rate-limiting step and produces toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides that lead to deposits in the form of amyloid plaques extracellularly, resulting in AD. METHOD: In this connection, 60 small peptides were evaluated for their in-silico studies to predict the bonding orientation with BACE1. Next, 5 peptides (12, 20, 21, 51, and 52) were selected based on high scoring of Vander Waal interactions with the catalytic site of the enzyme. RESULTS: The identified hit peptides were synthesized using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) elucidated their structures and 1 1 HNMR spectroscopy. According to their In-vitro BACE1 inhibitory study, peptides 21 having high Vander Waal forces showed significant BACE1 inhibition with IC50 = 4.64 ± 0.1μM). Moreover, the kinetic study revealed that peptide 21 is a mixed-type inhibitor and can interact at the active site and the allosteric site of BACE1.

    "AbstractText": "Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the alteration/aggregation of TAU protein. One of the main challenges of these diseases is that they have neither biomarkers nor pharmacological targets to stop the neurodegenerative process. Apart from the neurodegenerative process, tauopathies are also characterized by a chronic low-grade neuroinflammation process, where the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) protein plays an essential role. Our research aimed to explore the role of RIPK1 in various tauopathies. We examined mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as brain tissue samples from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a primary form of 4R tauopathy, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered a secondary tauopathy. Our findings show elevated levels of RIPK1 mRNA levels across various forms of tauopathies, in both mouse models and human tissue samples associated with primary and secondary TAU-related disorders. Furthermore, we investigated the potential of using a RIPK1 inhibitor, known as GSK2982772, in a mouse model as a novel treatment strategy for FTD. The data showed that GSK2982772 treatment effectively reduced the reactive astrocyte response triggered by TAUP301L overexpression. However, this RIPK1 inhibitor failed to protect against the neurodegeneration caused by elevated TAUP301L levels in the hippocampal region. These results suggest that although inhibiting RIPK1 activity may help reduce TAU-related astrogliosis in the brain, the complexity of the inflammatory pathways involved could explain the absence of neuroprotective effects against TAU-induced neurodegeneration.",

The potential of alkaloids derived from the genus Erythrina as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors is being investigated to enhance acetylcholine levels in the brain, which is crucial for the treatment of AD. The objective of this study is to identify Erythrina alkaloids with strong inhibitory capacity against AChE and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-step computational approach was employed, beginning with the virtual screening of 143 Erythrina alkaloid structures using molecular docking against the human AChE crystal structure. The binding affinities were compared with the known AChE inhibitor, galantamine. The top alkaloid, 8-oxoerymelanthine (128), was subjected to further analysis through molecular dynamics simulations, with the objective of evaluating its stability and interactions. In silico ADMET predictions were conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic properties. The applicability of Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to evaluate oral drug-likeness. RESULTS: 8-Oxoerymelanthine (128) exhibited the highest binding affinity and remarkable stability in molecular dynamics simulations. The toxicity predictions indicated a low risk of mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity. Pharmacokinetic assessments indicated good absorption, moderate blood-brain barrier penetration, and favorable metabolic and excretion profiles, supporting its potential as an orally active drug candidate. CONCLUSION: 8-Oxoerythmelanthine (128) exhibits strong potential as an AChE inhibitor with a favorable balance of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties.

Currently available AD drugs are associated with side effects and there is a need to develop natural drugs from plants. Aquilaria is as an endangered medicinal plant genus (commonly called agarwood plants) and various products of Aquilaria plant spp. including resinous heartwood, leaves, bark, and stem have been widely used in various traditional medicine systems. Research on agarwood plants is sparse and only a few previous studies demonstrated their neuroprotective properties in vitro. Owing to the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolites in agarwood plants, it is imperative not only to protect these plants but also evaluate the bioactivity of agarwood phytochemicals. METHODS: This study used Molsoft tools to predict the physicochemical properties of agarwood ligands, including the number of H-bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, lipophilicity, solubility, and the molecular polar surface area and volume of agarwood ligands. Additionally, ADMET (absorption, digestion, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties were predicted using ADMETlab 2.0. Computational methods such as AutoDock Vina and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were employed for the docking of 41 selected agarwood compounds with AD-related molecular targets. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: According to docking data, three compounds aquilarisin (ASN), aquilarisinin (ANN), aquilarixanthone (AXN) showed highest binding affinity to selected AD targets compared to their known inhibitors. MD simulation studies revealed that, selected agarwood compounds' protein-ligand complexes showed remarkable structural stability throughout 100ns simulation. The agarwood chemicals aquilarisin, aquilarisinin, aquilarixanthone, pillion (PLN), and agarotetrol (AGT) are consequently suggested as some of the found hits against AD targets, however, additional experimental validation is required to establish their effectiveness.",

    "AbstractText": "The interactions between long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) play critical roles in life processes, highlighting the necessity to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art models. Here, we introduced TEC-LncMir, a novel approach for predicting lncRNA-miRNA interaction using Transformer Encoder and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). TEC-LncMir treats lncRNA and miRNA sequences as natural languages, encodes them using the Transformer Encoder, and combines representations of a pair of microRNA and lncRNA into a contact tensor (a three-dimensional array). Afterward, TEC-LncMir treats the contact tensor as a multi-channel image, utilizes a four-layer CNN to extract the contact tensor's features, and then uses these features to predict the interaction between the pair of lncRNA and miRNA. We applied a series of comparative experiments to demonstrate that TEC-LncMir significantly improves lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction, compared with existing state-of-the-art models. We also trained TEC-LncMir utilizing a large training dataset, and as expected, TEC-LncMir achieves unprecedented performance. Moreover, we integrated miRanda into TEC-LncMir to show the secondary structures of high-confidence interactions. Finally, we utilized TEC-LncMir to identify microRNAs interacting with lncRNA NEAT1, where NEAT1 performs as a competitive endogenous RNA of the microRNAs' targets (mRNAs) in brain cells. We also demonstrated the regulatory mechanism of NEAT1 in Alzheimer's disease via transcriptome analysis and sequence alignment analysis. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectivity of TEC-LncMir, suggest a potential regulation of miRNAs by NEAT1 in Alzheimer's disease, and take a significant step forward in lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Exploring the Link between Periodontal Disease and Systemic Conditions: Implications for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Rheumatoid Arthritis.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: There is a growing correlation between periodontal disease, a common inflammatory disorder that affects the tissues supporting the teeth, and several systemic diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients from a tertiary care hospital, ages 50-75, participated in this cross-sectional research. The subjects were split up into four groups: 50 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, 50 with Alzheimer's disease, 50 with Parkinson's disease, and 50 with periodontal disease. To evaluate periodontal condition, including clinical attachment loss and pocket depth, thorough oral exams were performed. Measurements were made of serum biomarkers for inflammation, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate regression models were used to examine correlations between the severity of periodontal disease and the underlying systemic diseases. RESULTS: In all groups, there were significant relationships between higher levels of indicators of systemic inflammation and the severity of periodontal disease. In comparison to healthy controls (CRP mean value: 2.1 mg/L; IL-6 mean value: 6.4 pg/mL), participants with periodontal disease had higher mean levels of CRP (5.6 mg/L) and IL-6 (mean value: 12.8 pg/mL). Furthermore, compared to those with rheumatoid arthritis, those with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disorders showed higher levels of pocket depth and periodontal attachment loss. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results point to a possible connection between systemic diseases such rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.",

    "AbstractText": "When integrating data from multiple sources, a common challenge is block-wise missing. Most existing methods address this issue only in cross-sectional studies. In this paper, we propose a method for variable selection when combining datasets from multiple sources in longitudinal studies. To account for block-wise missing in covariates, we impute the missing values multiple times based on combinations of samples from different missing pattern and predictors from different data sources. We then use these imputed data to construct estimating equations, and aggregate the information across subjects and sources with the generalized method of moments. We employ the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty in variable selection and use the extended Bayesian Information Criterion criteria for tuning parameter selection. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator, and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method through numerical experiments. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study to identify sensitive early-stage biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease, which is crucial for early disease detection and personalized treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "The neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (ErbB4) signaling pathway is expressed in multiple systems of the body and has been shown to be involved in various life activities, with upregulation observed in some pathological processes. ErbB4 is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, which, when activated by its ligand, NRG1, forms the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway. Initially, this pathway garnered attention due to its high expression and relevance in cardiovascular system development and related diseases. However, little was known about its role in other systems in the past. In recent years, with the advancement of research in neuroscience, the role of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in the nervous system has gradually been recognized. Increasing evidence suggests that upon activation, the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in various neuronal activities such as proliferation, development, and differentiation, and is closely associated with a variety of physiological and pathological processes including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy, among others. Moreover, based on extensive research data, mature clinical diagnostic and therapeutic approaches targeting the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway have been proven effective. Additionally, a detailed information on the risk score based on the pathway's activity is included, highlighting its potential in predicting and managing neurological disorders. Therefore, it can be considered that the role and mechanism of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in neurological diseases are valuable research topics in the field of neuroscience. This article reviews recent research on the role of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway in the nervous system.",

In vivo, the Morris water maze (MWM) test assessed learning and memory abilities, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and immunohistochemistry were conducted to plaque deposition and content of Aβ. Western blotting was performed to p-P13K, P13K, p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK3β and GSK3β expression of the hippocampus in mice, respectively. In vitro, the viability of the cells, the apoptosis of the cells and the level of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, p-P13K, P13K, p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK3β and GSK3β expression of PC12 cells were examined by CCK-8 assay, Hoechst 33342 and Calcein/propidium iodide (PI) staining, flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. Our results indicated SA could improve learning and memory abilities and decrease plaque deposition and content of Aβ of the hippocampus in mice. Furthermore, SA increased cell viability and lessened cell apoptosis by increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, lessening protein levels of Caspase-3 in PC12 cells. SA upregulated the phosphorylation expression level of PI3K/Akt/GSK3β in APP/PS1 mice and PC12 cells.

    "ArticleTitle": "Repurposing lapatinib as a triple antagonist of chemokine receptors 3, 4, and 5.",
    "AbstractText": "Chemokine receptors CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 are G protein-coupled receptors implicated in diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, asthma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and macular degeneration. Recently, CCR3 and CCR4 have emerged as potential stroke targets. Although only the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc is US Food and Drug Administration-approved (for HIV), we curated data on CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 antagonists from ChEMBL to develop and validate machine learning models. The top 5-fold cross-validation statistics for these models were high for both classification and regression models for CCR3 (receiver operating characteristic [ROC], 0.94; R2 = 0.8), CCR4 (ROC, 0.98; R2 = 0.57), and CCR5 (ROC, 0.96; R2 = 0.78). The models for CCR3/4 were used to screen a small library of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and 17 were initially tested in vitro against both CCR3/4 receptors. A promising compound lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was identified as an antagonist for CCR3 (IC50, 0.7 μM) and CCR4 (IC50, 1.8 μM). Additional testing also identified it as an CCR5 antagonist (IC50, 0.9 μM), and it showed moderate in vitro HIV I inhibition. We demonstrated how machine learning can be used to identify molecules for repurposing as antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors such as CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5. Lapatinib may represent a new orally available chemical probe for these 3 receptors, and it provides a starting point for further chemical optimization for multiple diseases impacting human health. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We describe the building of machine learning models for the chemokine receptors CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 trained on data from the ChEMBL database. Using these models, we identified lapatinib as a potent inhibitor of CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5. Our study illustrates the potential of machine learning in identifying molecules for repurposing as antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors, including CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5, which have various therapeutic applications.",

Despite an increasing number of studies on MEAMs, few researchers have explored how MEAMs are bound in the brain. METHODS: In the current study activation indexed by fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) during familiar and unfamiliar MEAM retrieval was compared in a sample of 24 healthy older adults. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the impact of age-related gray matter volume (GMV) reduction in key regions associated with MEAM-related activation. In addition to a T1 structural scan, neuroimaging data were collected while participants listened to familiar music (MEAM retrieval) versus unfamiliar music. RESULTS: When listening to familiar compared to unfamiliar music, greater fALFF activation patterns were observed in the right parahippocampal gyrus, controlling for age and GMV. The current findings for the familiar (MEAM) condition have implications for cognitive aging as persons experiencing age-related memory decline are particularly susceptible to volumetric reduction in the parahippocampal cortex. Post-hoc analyses to explore correlations between brain activity and the content of MEAMs were performed using the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that MEAM-related activation of the parahippocampal cortex is evident in normative older adults. However, it is yet to be determined whether such brain states are attainable in older adult populations diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and/or prodromal Alzheimer's disease.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A 3'UTR Insertion Is a Candidate Causal Variant at the TMEM106B Locus Associated With Increased Risk for FTLD-TDP.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Single-nucleotide variants near TMEM106B associate with the risk of frontotemporal lobar dementia with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and Alzheimer disease (AD) in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but the causal variant at this locus remains unclear. Here, we asked whether a novel structural variant on TMEM106B is the causal variant. METHODS: An exploratory analysis identified structural variants on neurodegeneration-related genes. Subsequent analyses focused on an Alu element insertion on the 3'UTR of TMEM106B. This study included data from longitudinal aging and neurogenerative disease cohorts at Stanford University, case-control cohorts in the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), and expression and proteomics data from Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). Four hundred thirty-two individuals from 2 Stanford aging cohorts were whole-genome long-read and short-read sequenced. A total of 16,906 samples from ADSP were short-read sequenced. Genotypes, transcriptomics, and proteomics data were available in 1,979 participants from an aging and dementia cohort at WUSTL. Selection criteria were specific to each cohort. In primary analyses, the linkage disequilibrium between the TMEM106B locus variants in the FTLD-TDP GWAS and the 3'UTR insertion was estimated. We then estimated linkage by ancestry in the ADSP and evaluated the effect of the TMEM106B lead variant on mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: The primary analysis included 432 participants (52.5% female, age range 45-92 years). We identified a 316 bp Alu insertion overlapping the TMEM106B 3'UTR tightly linked with top GWAS variants rs3173615(C) and rs1990622(A). In ADSP European ancestry participants, this insertion is in equivalent linkage with rs1990622(A) (R2 = 0.962, D' = 0.998) and rs3173615(C) (R2 = 0.960, D' = 0.996). In African ancestry participants, the insertion is in stronger linkage with rs1990622(A) (R2 = 0.992, D' = 0.998) than with rs3173615(C) (R2 = 0.811, D' = 0.994). In public data sets, rs1990622 was consistently associated with TMEM106B protein levels but not with mRNA expression. In the WUSTL data set, rs1990622 is associated with TMEM106B protein levels in plasma and CSF, but not with TMEM106B mRNA expression. DISCUSSION: We identified a novel Alu element insertion in the 3'UTR of TMEM106B in tight linkage with the lead FTLD-TDP risk variant. The lead variant is associated with TMEM106B protein levels, but not expression. The 3'UTR insertion is a lead candidate for the causal variant at this complex locus, pending confirmation with functional studies.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and the sixth most common cause of death in the US according to the Alzheimer's Association. As regards, to date, no effective treatments are available because of the multifactorial nature of the disease, therefore, a large body of recent research has been allocated to the design and development of multi-target-directed ligands that can become effective drug candidates. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A novel series of benzamide derivatives (5a-5l) containing piperidine core were synthesized in the current work. After identification of the chemical structures of the members of this series using 1H NMR, IR, and MS spectra, their anti-acetylcholinesterase activity was assessed by the Ellman᾽s test. Docking studies were also performed to investigate the binding mode and determine the interacting amino acids with the corresponding ligands. Finally, the pharmacokinetic (ADME parameters) of the most potent derivative (5d) was predicted and compared with donepezil. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Compound 5d possessing the fluorine atom substitution at position ortho was the most active compound in these series (IC50 = 13 ± 2.1 nM). This compound demonstrated superior activity than the reference drug donepezil (IC50 = 0.6 ± 0.05 µM). Molecular docking showed a significant hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl group of compounds 5d with tyrosine 121 into the active site of acetylcholinesterase. Fortunately, this compound showed better promising ADME properties than donepezil.

Even though recent years have witnessed the development of gene therapy from among the different therapeutic approaches affecting pathophysiological mechanisms, intriguing aspects exist regarding the effectiveness, safety, and mechanism of action of gene therapies. Micro ribonucleic acid (microRNA-miRNA), as a fundamental gene regulator, regulates messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) by directly binding through the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). MicroRNA-219 is a specific brain-enriched miRNA associated with neurodevelopmental disorders that play crucial roles in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitorcells, promotion of oligodendrocyte maturation, remyelination, and cognitive functions to the extent that it can be considered a potential therapeutic option for demyelination in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury and reverse chronic inflammation pains. Additionally, miR-219 regulates the circadian clock, influencing the duration of the circadian clock period. This regulation can impact mood stability and is associated with phase fluctuations in bipolar patients. Furthermore, miR-219 also plays a role in modulating tau toxicity, which is relevant to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Finally, it reportedly has protective effects against seizures and Parkinson's disease, as well as neoplasms, by inhibiting proliferation, suppressing invasion, and inducing cell death in tumor cells. Exploring the miR-219 molecular pathways and their therapeutic effects on central nervous system disorders and the mechanisms involved, the present review study aims to illustrate how this information may change the future of gene therapy.",

Among these needs, there is a requirement for tools that can easily assess the ability to recall memories, which changes early in the disease. OBJECTIVES: We established Self Assessment Memory Scale (SAMS) method before, which includes 8-picture recall test and 16-word recognition test. We adopted this method to software that can be operated on a tablet computer so that participants can perform the method independently. The purpose of this study was to validate this method. DESIGN: Cross sectional research. SETTING: Some of the participants were recruited from hospitals for patients diagnosed with AD or MCI. The others were recruited from three regional cohorts of healthy older adults. PARTICIPANTS: The total number of participants was 304 (20 of whom had AD or MCI), and the mean age was 71.2 years. 64% of the participants were women. MEASUREMENTS: We used the logical memory subtest of the WMS-R as the standard for memory evaluation and assessed the relationship between this score and the SAMS score calculated by the software. RESULTS: The 2nd SAMS score were higher than the 1st SAMS score in some participants, on the other hand, the intraclass correlation coefficient was good. Since the number of false recognition in the 16-word recognition test was higher in participants with lower LM II scores, we developed a new score to reflect the ratio of false recognition, SAMS-R, and we observed it has good correlation with LM II. The mean SAMS-R score decreased gradually after the age of 65 years, indicating that age-related changes in memory recall can be detected. The ROC curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the detectability to determine whether if the WMS-R LM II score is above or below 10, showing that the AUC was greater than 0.9. CONCLUSION: SAMS-R, which can be performed on a tablet literally by himself/herself independently, shows a high correlation with the WMS-R Logical Memory II score, and has the advantage of being performed in a short time without the need for a clinical psychologist or other personnel.",

    "AbstractText": "Anomalous chromosomes are the cause of genetic diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, and autism. Karyotype analysis is the standard procedure for diagnosing genetic disorders. Identifying anomalies is often costly, time-consuming, heavily reliant on expert interpretation, and requires considerable manual effort. Efforts are being made to automate karyogram analysis. However, the unavailability of large datasets, particularly those including samples with chromosomal abnormalities, presents a significant challenge. The development of automated models requires extensive labeled and incredibly abnormal data to accurately identify and analyze abnormalities, which are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities. Although the deep learning-based architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in medical image anomaly detection, it cannot be generalized well because of the lack of anomalous datasets. This study introduces a novel hybrid approach that combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to overcome the challenges of limited labeled data and scalability in chromosomal analysis. An Autoencoder-based system is initially trained with unlabeled data to identify chromosome patterns. It is fine-tuned on labeled data, followed by a classification step using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A unique dataset of 234,259 chromosome images, including the training, validation, and test sets, was used. Marking a significant achievement in the scale of chromosomal analysis. The proposed hybrid system accurately detects structural anomalies in individual chromosome images, achieving 99.3% accuracy in classifying normal and abnormal chromosomes. We also used a structural similarity index measure and template matching to identify the part of the abnormal chromosome that differed from the normal one. This automated model has the potential to significantly contribute to the early detection and diagnosis of chromosome-related disorders that affect both genetic health and neurological behavior.",

Despite the significant research efforts, the ability to completely prevent or effectively treat AD and its related dementias remains limited. Protein kinases are integral to AD pathology and represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. METHODS: A series of pyrimidine-based compounds 4-(4-(arylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)-6-(thiophen-3-yl)pyrimidine derivatives (8-14) were synthesized and characterised. ATPase inhibition was carried out against the MARK4 enzyme. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at 500 ns was carried out against MARK4 (PDB: 5ES1). The drug-likeness feature and toxicity of the molecules were evaluated using QikProp and other tools. RESULTS: Compounds were synthesized following a multi-step approach and characterized using multi-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H/13C-NMR) and mass spectrometry. ATPase inhibition assay of the compounds against MARK4 showed an IC50 value in the micromolar (μM) range. The results of the docking studies were consistent with the in-vitro experiments and identified (9) and (14) as the candidates with the highest affinity towards MARK4. MD simulation further supported these results, showing that the binding of ligands stabilises the target protein.

Gut dysbiosis, which results in a leaky intestinal barrier, exacerbates inflammation and plays a significant role in linking obesity to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration through the gut-brain/gut-brain-liver axis. Inflammatory states within the brain can lead to insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, autolysosomal dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress. These disruptions impair normal neuronal function and subsequently lead to cognitive decline and motor deficits, similar to the pathologies observed in major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Understanding the underlying disease mechanisms is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to address defects in these inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In this review, we summarize and provide insights into different therapeutic strategies, including methods to alter gut dysbiosis, lifestyle changes, dietary supplementation, as well as pharmacological agents derived from natural sources, that target obesity-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Case Report: A 3' splice site variation in RORB exon 3 associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in a child.",
    "AbstractText": "The RORB (Retinoic Acid Receptor-related orphan receptor β) gene plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and is strongly associated with bipolar disorder, cognitive function, and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, RORB has also emerged as a novel potential gene involved in generalized epilepsy and absence seizures. However, due to the complexity of RORB gene function, reports on pathogenic variations of RORB genes are still lacking. In this study, we present a case of a 5-year-old epilepsy patient. Through trio whole-exome sequencing, a heterozygous variant was identified at the splice site of 3' end of exon 3 in the RORB gene (chr9:77249546, NM_006914.3: c.94-1G>A). This c.94-1G>A variant disrupts normal mRNA splicing, leading to the premature termination of the RORB protein. According to ACMG guidelines, this variant is classified as \"likely pathogenic\". Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of previously reported pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in RORB, contributing to the growing body of evidence linking this gene to epilepsy. Our findings offer valuable insights into the role of RORB in epilepsy pathogenesis, and the splice site variant identified in this study further expands the mutational spectrum of the RORB gene.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The future emergence of disease-modifying treatments for dementia highlights the urgent need to identify reliable and easily accessible tools for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and cost-effective technique commonly used in the study of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the specific alterations in EEG biomarkers associated with AD remain unclear when using a limited number of electrodes. METHODS: We studied pathological characteristics of AD using low-density EEG data collected from 26 AD and 29 healthy controls (HC) during both eye closed (EC) and eye opened (EO) resting conditions. The analysis including power spectrum, phase lock value (PLV), and weighted lag phase index (wPLI) and power-to-power frequency coupling (theta/beta) analysis were applied to extract features in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. RESULTS: During the EC condition, the AD group exhibited decreased alpha power compared to HC. Additionally, both analysis of PLV and wPLI in the theta band indicated that the alterations in the AD brain network predominantly involved in the frontal region with the opposite changes. Moreover, the AD group had increased frequency coupling in the frontal and central regions. Surprisingly, no group difference was found in the EO condition. Notably, decreased theta band functional connectivity within the fronto-central lobe and increased frequency coupling in frontal region were found in AD group from EC to EO. More importantly, the combination of EC and EO quantitative EEG features improved the inter-group classification accuracy when using support vector machine (SVM) in older adults with AD. These findings highlight the complementary nature of EC and EO conditions in assessing and differentiating AD cohorts. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the potential of utilizing low-density EEG data from resting-state paradigms, combined with machine learning techniques, to improve the identification and classification of AD.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Repurposing FDA-Approved Drugs Against Potential Drug Targets Involved in Brain Inflammation Contributing to Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that continues to have a rising number of cases. While extensive research has been conducted in the last few decades, only a few drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment, and even fewer aim to be curative rather than manage symptoms. There remains an urgent need for understanding disease pathogenesis, as well as identifying new targets for further drug discovery. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to stem from a build-up of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques as well as tangles of tau proteins. Furthermore, inflammation in the brain is known to arise from the degeneration of tissue and the build-up of insoluble material. Therefore, there is a potential link between the pathology of AD and inflammation in the brain, especially as the disease progresses to later stages where neuronal death and degeneration levels are higher. Proteins that are relevant to both brain inflammation and AD thus make ideal potential targets for therapeutics; however, the proteins need to be evaluated to determine which targets would be ideal for potential drug therapeutic treatments, or 'druggable'. Druggability analysis was conducted using two structure-based methods (i.e., Drug-Like Density analysis and SiteMap), as well as a sequence-based approach, SPIDER. The most druggable targets were then evaluated using single-nuclei sequencing data for their clinical relevance to inflammation in AD. For each of the top five targets, small molecule docking was used to evaluate which FDA approved drugs were able to bind with the chosen proteins. The top targets included DRD2 (inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity), C9 (binds with C5B8 to form the membrane attack complex), C4b (binds with C2a to form C3 convertase), C5AR1 (GPCR that binds C5a), and GABA-A-R (GPCR involved in inhibiting neurotransmission). Each target had multiple potential inhibitors from the FDA-approved drug list with decent binding infinities. Among these inhibitors, two drugs were found as top inhibitors for more than one protein target. They are C15H14N2O2 and v316 (Paracetamol), used to treat pain/inflammation originally for cataracts and relieve headaches/fever, respectively. These results provide the groundwork for further experimental investigation or clinical trials.",

    "AbstractText": "A proposed contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the induction of neuroinflammation due to tau and beta-amyloid protein accumulation causing neuronal injury and dysfunction. Dysregulation of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to this inflammatory response in the brain of patients with AD, yet the literature has not yet been systematically reviewed. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Embase and PsychINFO for articles published up to April 22, 2024. Papers were included if they measured levels of lipid mediators and/or enzymes involved in their production in post-mortem brain samples from patients with AD and control without neurological disease. A total of 50 relevant studies were identified. Despite heterogeneity in the results, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, including 5-, 11-, 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid oxylipins and prostaglandin D2, were significantly higher, while anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4 and DHA-derived docosanoids were significantly lower in brains of patients with AD compared to control (16 studies). Thirty-seven articles reported on enzymes, with 32 reporting values for enzyme level changes between AD and controls. Among the 32 articles, the majority reported on levels of cyclooxygenase (COX) (18/32), with fewer studies reporting on phospholipase (8/32), lipoxygenase (LOX) (4/32) and prostaglandin E synthase (4/32). Enzyme levels also exhibited variability in the literature, with a trend towards elevated expression of enzymes involved in the pro-inflammatory response, including COX and LOX enzymes. Overall, these results are consistent with the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD measured by lipid mediators. However, the specific contribution of each lipid metabolite and enzymes to either the progression or persistence of AD remains unclear, and more research is required.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder that causes incurable and irreversible neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. The progress of this disease is gradual and depending on the stage of its detection, only its progression can be treated, reducing the most aggressive symptoms and the speed of its neurodegenerative progress. This article proposes an early detection model for the diagnosis of AD by performing analyses in Alzheimer's progression patient datasets, provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including only neuropsychological assessments and making use of feature selection techniques and machine learning models. The focus of this research is to build an ensemble machine learning model capable of early detection of a patient with Alzheimer's or a cognitive state that leads to it, based on their results in neuropsychological assessments identified as highly relevant for the detection of Alzheimer's. The proposed approach for the detection of AD is presented with the inclusion of the feature selection technique recursive feature elimination (RFE) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the ensemble model consists of logistic regression (LR), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and nearest centroid (Nearcent). The datasets downloaded from ADNI were divided into 13 subsets including: cognitively normal (CN) vs subjective memory concern (SMC), CN vs early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), CN vs late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), CN vs AD, SMC vs EMCI, SMC vs LMCI, SMC vs AD, EMCI vs LMCI, EMCI vs AD, LMCI vs AD, MCI vs AD, CN vs AD and CN vs MCI. From all the feature results, a custom model was created using RFE, AIC and testing each model. This work presents a customized model for a backend platform to perform one-versus-all analysis and provide a basis for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's at its current stage.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition with a complex pathogenesis, sometimes hereditary, characterized by the loss of neurons and synapses, along with the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Early detection, particularly among individuals at high risk, is critical for effective treatment or prevention, yet remains challenging due to data variability and incompleteness. Most current research relies on single data modalities, potentially limiting comprehensive staging of AD. This study addresses this gap by integrating multimodal data-including clinical and genetic information-using deep learning (DL) models, with a specific focus on random vector functional link (RVFL) networks, to enhance early detection of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our findings demonstrate that ensemble deep RVFL (edRVFL) models, when combined with effective data imputation techniques such as Winsorized-mean (Wmean), achieve superior performance in detecting early stages of AD. Notably, the edRVFL model achieved an accuracy of 98.8%, precision of 98.3%, recall of 98.4%, and F1-score of 98.2%, outperforming traditional machine learning models like support vector machines, random forests, and decision trees.

Though the most common diagnosis is corticobasal degeneration (CBD), the spectrum of underlying pathologies expands beyond CBD and can overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases and even the neuroimmunology field. We will review possible clinical presentations and cues that can point towards the etiology. We will also discuss the most recent available biomarkers to facilitate a more accurate diagnosis. Additionally, we will examine current and future potential therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS: The range of available fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers is increasing and some are already being used in clinical practice. While the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is largely aimed at managing symptoms, early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for initiating early management and enrollment in clinical trials. The recent approval of a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised hopes for the development of more therapeutic options for other proteinopathies. Several candidates are currently being studied in clinical trial pipelines, particularly those targeting tau pathology.

Sex and APOE ε4 genotype play a crucial role in modulating cognitive outcomes and depression in various neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. However, the combined effects of APOE genotype and sex on cognitive performance and depression in temporal lobe epilepsy have not been previously investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (i) identify impaired cognitive performance and clinically relevant depression; (ii) explore the interaction between sex and APOE ε4 genotype on cognitive performance and depression in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: We used a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to assess domains such as learning and memory, attention, executive functions, language, and visuo-spatial constructional skills and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. We also performed APOE genotyping to assess its role in the study. The final sample was composed by fifty-four patients (53.7% female). Cognitive performance and depression were analyzed using normative cut-off scores. To examine the main effects and interactions of sex and APOE ε4 carrier status on neuropsychological test scores and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, we also conducted a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Female APOE ε4 carriers compared to normative cut-offs, exhibited poor performance on multiple test scores, including the MMSE, The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (immediate and delayed recall), The Corsi Block-Tapping Task, The Verbal Fluency Test, The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and The Pentagon-copying Test. Males showed impairment only in visuo-spatial short-term memory. ANOVA analysis revealed significant main effects of APOE ε4 status and sex on the MMSE, The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, The Verbal Fluency, The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and The Pentagon-copying Test scores. Specifically, female APOE ε4 carriers performed consistently worse than other groups on many tasks. For depression, only an effect of sex emerged. Females scored higher besides APOE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of considering both sex and APOE genotype when assessing cognitive performance in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The significant cognitive deficits we observed among females carrying the APOE ε4 allele highlight previously unexplored genetic and sex-related influences on cognition. This has potential implications for personalized therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for targeted assessment and intervention.",

This heterogeneity can be studied and disentangled using data-driven clustering techniques. METHODS: We implemented a self-organizing map clustering algorithm on baseline volumetric MRI measures from nine brain regions of interest (ROIs) to cluster 1041 individuals enrolled in the placebo arm of the EXPEDITION3 trial. Volumetric MRI differences were compared among clusters. Demographics as well as baseline and longitudinal cognitive performance metrics were used to evaluate cluster characteristics. RESULTS: Three distinct clusters, with an overall silhouette coefficient of 0.491, were identified based on MRI volumetrics. Cluster 1 (N = 400) had the largest baseline volumetric measures across all ROIs and the best cognitive performance at baseline. Cluster 2 (N = 269) had larger hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes, but smaller parietal lobe volumes in comparison with the third cluster (N = 372). Significant between-group mean differences were observed between Clusters 1 and 2 (difference, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.85 to 2.91; P < 0.001), Clusters 1 and 3 (difference, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.44; P < 0.001), but not between Clusters 2 and 3 (difference, 0.45; 95% CI, -0.11 to 1.02; P = 0.146) in ADAS-14. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric MRI can be used to identify homogenous clusters of amyloid positive individuals with mild dementia. The groups identified differ in baseline and longitudinal characteristics. Cluster 1 shows little ADAS-14 change over the first 40 weeks of study on placebo treatment and may be unsuitable for identifying early benefits of treatment.",

METHODS: Data on the incidence rates, DALY rates, and death rates of AD across various geographic populations from 1990 to 2021 were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were employed to forecast the disease burden from 2022 to 2030. RESULTS: The projected global burden of Alzheimer's disease from 2022 to 2030 indicates a decrease in DALYs, with an Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) of -1.44 (95% CI: -1.45, -1.42). Similarly, death rates and incidence rates also show a decline, with EAPCs of -1.80 (95% CI: -1.83, -1.77) and -1.27 (95% CI: -1.29, -1.26) respectively. Gender-specific analysis reveals that the projected global incidence EAPC from 2022 to 2030 is estimated at -1.73 (95% CI: -1.75, -1.70) for males and -1.03 (95% CI: -1.04, -1.02) for females. Regionally, Andean Latin America and the Caribbean exhibit the highest positive EAPCs for DALYs at 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.94) and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.60) respectively, while Eastern Europe shows the lowest EAPC at -16.31 (95% CI: -18.60, -13.95). Country-specific projections highlight Cyprus and Serbia with the highest positive EAPCs for DALYs at 12.55 (95% CI: 11.21, 13.91) and 9.6416 (95% CI: 8.86, 10.4333) respectively. On the other hand, Bahrain and Armenia exhibit significant negative EAPCs at -87.28 (95% CI: -94.66, -69.70) and -85.41 (95% CI: -92.80, -70.41). An analysis based on the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) reveals that regions with higher SDI values have greater burdens of AD, with countries having SDI ≥ 0.8 showing significantly higher age-standardized Incidence Rates (ASIR), age-standardized Death Rates (ASDR), and age-standardized DALY rates compared to those with SDI < 0.8. CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2030, global burden of AD is projected to decrease, with significant gender and regional disparities.

Its high heterogeneity and elevated conversion rate to dementia pose challenges for accurate diagnosis and monitoring, highlighting the urgent need to identify methodologies focused on the early detection and intervention of MCI. Due to their biological characteristics, microRNAs (miRNAs) are potential candidates as non-invasive molecular markers for the identification and assessment of MCI progression. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the miRNAs commonly deregulated in MCI, focusing on expression profiles in plasma, serum, and extracellular vesicle samples. Our analysis identified eight upregulated miRNAs, including hsa-miR-149-3p, and four downregulated miRNAs, such as Let-7f-5p. Notably, hsa-miR-149-3p emerged as a central node in interaction networks, suggesting its crucial role in regulating cellular processes relevant to MCI. Additionally, pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in biological processes associated with transcriptional regulation and neurodegeneration. Our results underscore the potential of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive molecular markers for MCI and open the possibility for new methodologies that enable more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Validating the expression of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-149-3p and Let-7f-5p, along with identifying their functional role in the specific context of MCI, is essential to establish their biological relevance.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with rising prevalence due to the aging global population. Existing methods for diagnosing AD are struggling to detect the condition in its earliest and most treatable stages. One early indicator of AD is a substantial decrease in the brain's glucose metabolism. Metabolomics can detect disturbances in biofluids, which may be advantageous for early detection of some AD-related changes. The study aims to predict brain hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease using metabolomics findings and develop a predictive model based on metabolomic data. METHODS: The data used in this study were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. We conducted a longitudinal study with three assessment time points to investigate the predictive power of baseline metabolomics for modeling longitudinal fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) trajectory changes in AD patients. A total of 44 participants with AD were included. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were used for cognitive assessments. A single global brain hypo-metabolism index was used as the outcome variable. RESULTS: Across models, we observed consistent positive relationships between specific cholesterol esters - CE (20:3) (p = 0.005) and CE (18:3) (p = 0.0039) - and FDG-PET metrics, indicating these baseline metabolites may be valuable indicators of future PET score changes. Selected triglycerides like DG-O (16:0-20:4) also showed time-specific positive associations (p = 0.017).

    "ArticleTitle": "Effects of acupuncture at the Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) points on functional connectivity with the retrosplenial cortex in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been demonstrated to have a promising effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is one of the earliest brain regions affected in AD, and changes in its functional connectivity (FC) are reported to underlie disease-associated memory impairment. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in patients with AD. METHODS: Demographic data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 14 AD patients and 14 normal controls (NCs) matched by age, sex, and educational level at baseline. After the baseline MRI scan, acupuncture stimulation on the Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) points was performed for 3 min. Then, another 10 min of fMRI data were acquired after the needle was withdrawn. A dataset that included 100 healthy participants was also included to construct a reliable FC map of the RSC. Two sets of regions of interest (ROIs) in the RSC were selected to assess the sustained effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in AD patients and NCs. RESULTS: Two sets of RSC ROI-based analyses demonstrated robust positive connectivity with the hippocampus (HPC). Furthermore, multiple brain regions, including the bilateral thalamus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), bilateral subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and right precuneus, showed decreased FC with the RSC in the AD group and increased FC with the RSC in the NC group after acupuncture compared to that at baseline. Acupuncture also specifically elicited increased FC between the RSC and the HPC as well as between the RSC and the parahippocampal gyrus in AD patients and decreased FC between the RSC and the visual cortices in NCs. Additionally, diminished FC with the RSC was correlated with neuropsychological scale scores in the AD group before acupuncture treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm and extend previous studies suggesting that acupuncture at Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) can exert bidirectional and benign regulatory effects on RSC connectivity in AD patients.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: a key frontier for future targeted therapies.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for approximately 70% of dementia cases worldwide. Patients gradually exhibit cognitive decline, such as memory loss, aphasia, and changes in personality and behavior. Research has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Mitochondrial dysfunction primarily leads to increased oxidative stress, imbalances in mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitophagy, and mitochondrial genome abnormalities. These mitochondrial abnormalities are closely associated with amyloid-beta and tau protein pathology, collectively accelerating the neurodegenerative process. This review summarizes the role of mitochondria in the development of AD, the latest research progress, and explores the potential of mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies for AD. Targeting mitochondria-related pathways may significantly improve the quality of life for AD patients in the future.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (sTREM1) are elevated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the relationship between CSF sTREM1 and hippocampal atrophy remains to be elucidated. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association between CSF sTREM1 levels and longitudinal changes in hippocampal volumes, and to determine if this relationship is moderated by cognitive status. METHODS: We included 576 participants, comprising 152 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 424 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals. In the cross-sectional analyses, Pearson's correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationship between baseline CSF sTREM1 levels and hippocampal volumes in both CU and CI participants. For the longitudinal analyses, a linear mixed-effects model was employed to assess the significance of the three-way interaction between CSF sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up time on adjusted hippocampal volume (aHV). Further stratified analyses based on cognitive status were performed to dissect the specific effects within each group. RESULTS: Our findings revealed significantly elevated baseline CSF sTREM1 levels in CI participants compared to CU participants. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that CSF sTREM1 levels were negatively associated with hippocampal volumes in both CU and CI participants. In the longitudinal analyses, the three-way interaction between CSF sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up time was found to be significant for aHV. Stratified analyses indicated that, in CI participants, higher CSF sTREM1 levels were associated with a more accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy, whereas no such association was observed in CU participants. CONCLUSION: These results underscore the complex interplay between neuroinflammation, as reflected by CSF sTREM1 levels, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive decline. The data suggest that neuroinflammation may contribute differently to hippocampal atrophy rates in CI versus CU individuals, highlighting the potential for targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in the prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Altered protein conformation can cause incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in SERPINI1, the gene encoding neuroserpin, can alter protein conformation resulting in cytotoxic aggregation leading to neuronal death. Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) is a rare autosomal dominant progressive myoclonic epilepsy that progresses to dementia and premature death. We developed HEK293T and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of FENIB, harboring a patient-specific pathogenic SERPINI1 variant or stably overexpressing mutant neuroserpin fused to GFP (MUT NS-GFP). Here, we utilized a personalized adenine base editor (ABE)-mediated approach to correct the pathogenic variant efficiently and precisely to restore neuronal dendritic morphology. ABE-treated MUT NS-GFP cells demonstrated reduced inclusion size and number. Using an inducible MUT NS-GFP neuron system, we identified early prevention of toxic protein expression allowed aggregate clearance, while late prevention halted further aggregation. To address several challenges for clinical applications of gene correction, we developed a neuron-specific engineered virus-like particle to optimize neuronal ABE delivery, resulting in higher correction efficiency. Our findings provide a targeted strategy that may treat FENIB and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases due to altered protein conformation such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between BDNF gene polymorphism, BDNF levels, and susceptibility to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: In this study, we investigated 107 elderly adults individuals from a community in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, with an average age of 73.17 ± 7.081 years. The participants included 52 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease and 55 cognitively normal elderly adults control subjects. The two groups were matched based on gender, age, and education level. We assessed their cognitive functions and analyzed their genotypes and serum BDNF levels. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the differences in serum BDNF levels between the MCI group and the control group. Multivariate linear regression was utilized to analyze the association between BDNF levels and susceptibility to MCI, as well as cognitive functions. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to investigate the association between BDNF gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing MCI, along with their interactions. RESULTS: The ANCOVA analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in serum BDNF levels between the MCI group and the control group (P > 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) total scores and MCI (r = -0.461, P = 0.001), with significant correlations observed in orientation (r = -0.420, P = 0.002). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that specific polymorphisms, including rs7103411 (CT+TT vs. CC), rs6265 (CT and CT+TT vs. CC), rs11030104 (AG and AG+GG vs. AA), and rs988748 (CG+CC vs. GG), were significantly associated with decreased serum BDNF levels (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that rs7103411 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to MCI; individuals with the CT or CC genotype had a 0.370 times lower risk of developing MCI compared to those with the TT genotype (OR = 0.370, 95% CI: 0.141-0.970, P = 0.043). A significant interaction was found between rs7103411 and social activity, which influenced the risk of developing MCI. Specifically, individuals with the CT or TT genotype of rs7103411 who engaged in social activities had a significantly lower risk of developing MCI (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.117-0.878, P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that BDNF rs7103411、rs6265、rs11030104 and rs988748 are associated with decreased serum BDNF levels in MCI patients. Individuals carrying the TT genotype in the BDNF rs7103411 gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to MCI. Individuals with the rs7103411 CT or TT genotype who participated in social activities showed a significantly reduced risk of developing MCI, suggesting that the interaction between the BDNF rs7103411 genotype and social activity can help reduce the risk of MCI.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Chronic periodontitis and tooth loss contribute to cognitive decline. Since many biological processes are shared by loss of teeth and loss of pulps, this study investigated the potential association between loss of pulp and the development of dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to investigate the association between dental treatment and the development of dementia. The records of dental treatment during the 10 years prior to the first diagnosis of dementia were extracted from the Elderly Cohort Database of the National Health Information Sharing Service of Korea. The independence of dementia compared to the number of pulps or teeth removed was evaluated using the chi-squared test. The subjects were grouped by the number of teeth or pulps treated, and their odds ratio for dementia was calculated. RESULTS: Analysis of 591,592 sessions for pulpectomy and 710,722 sessions for tooth extraction from 558,147 individuals revealed a significant association with Alzheimer's dementia, but not with vascular or unspecified dementia. The number of dementia patients based on the number of pulps or teeth extracted were significantly different across age groups. The odds ratios demonstrated a tendency to increase with the number of dental treatments and decrease with age at the time of diagnosis of dementia. The number of pulps removed to achieve a notable impact on Alzheimer's dementia was found to be lower than the number of teeth extracted. CONCLUSION: The loss of pulp increased incidence of Alzheimer's dementia, with the impact being more pronounced in younger geriatric groups.",

As an antioxidant iron chelator, its mechanisms are multimodal, involving the binding of brain iron and the consequent engagement of several pathways to counter pathogenesis across multiple diseases. We and other research groups have shown that IN DFO rescues cognitive impairment in several rodent models of Alzheimer Disease (AD). METHODS: This study was designed to probe dosing regimens to inform future clinical trials, while exploring mechanisms within the intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) model. RESULTS: Five weeks of daily IN dosing of Long Evans rats with 15 μL of a 1% (0.3 mg), but not 0.1% (0.03 mg), solution of DFO rescued cognitive impairment caused by ICV STZ administration as assessed with the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test of spatial memory and learning. Furthermore, IN DFO modulated several aspects of the neuroinflammatory milieu of the ICV STZ model, which was assessed through a novel panel of brain cytokines and immunohistochemistry. Using RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis, STZ was shown to induce several pathways of cell death and neuroinflammation, and IN DFO engaged multiple transcriptomic pathways involved in hippocampal neuronal survival. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this study is the first to assess the transcriptomic pathways and mechanisms associated with either the ICV STZ model or DFO treatment, and the first to demonstrate efficacy at this low dose.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can generally be divided into focal damage and diffuse damage, and neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage (nHIBD) is one of the causes of diffuse damage. Patients with nHIBD are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the shared pathogenesis of patients affected with both neurological disorders has not been fully elucidated. PURPOSE: We here aim to identify the shared molecular signatures between nHIBD and AD. We used an integrated analysis of the cortex gene expression data, targeting differential expression of genes related to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury. METHODS: The gene expression profiles of Alzheimer's disease (GSE203206) and that of Neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage (GSE23317) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of Alzheimer's disease and neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage by limma package analysis, five kinds of analyses were performed on them, namely Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, DEG-transcription factor interactions and DEG-microRNA interactions, protein-drug interactions and protein-disease association analysis, and gene-inflammation association analysis and protein-inflammation association analysis. RESULTS: In total, 12 common DEGs were identified including HSPB1, VIM, MVD, TUBB4A, AACS, ANXA6, DIRAS2, RPH3A, CEND1, KALM, THOP1, AREL1. We also identified 11 hub proteins, three central regulatory transcription factors, and three microRNAs encoded by the DEGs. Protein-drug interaction analysis showed that CYC1 and UQCRFS1 are associated with different drugs. Gene-disease association analysis shows Mammary Neoplasms, Neoplasm Metastasis, Schizophrenia, and Brain Ischemia diseases are the most relevant to the hub proteins we identified. Gene-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub gene AREL1 is related to inflammatory response, while the protein-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub proteins AKT1 and MAPK14 are related to inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the shared molecular mechanisms between AD and nHIBD. These common pathways and hub genes could potentially be used to design therapeutic interventions, reducing the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease development in survivors of neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemia brain injury.",

METHODS: Using 2D gray level co-occurrence matrix (2D-GLCM) texture features, volume, standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR), and obesity from different neuroimaging modalities, the study applies various classifiers, demonstrating a feature importance analysis in each region of interest. The research employs four classifiers, namely linear support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression (LR), and logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent (LRSGD) classifiers, to determine feature importance, leading to subsequent validation using a probabilistic neural network classifier. RESULTS: The research highlights the critical role of brain texture features, particularly in memory regions, for AD detection. Significant sex-specific differences are observed, with males showing significance in texture features in memory regions, volume in vision regions, and SUVR in speech regions, while females exhibit significance in texture features in memory and speech regions, and SUVR in vision regions. Additionally, the study analyzes how obesity affects features used in AD prediction models, clarifying its effects on speech and vision regions, particularly brain volume. CONCLUSION: The findings contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of feature fusion, sex-specific differences, and the impact of obesity on AD-related biomarkers, paving the way for future research in early AD detection strategies and cognitive impairment classification.",

The objective of this research was to construct and validate a nomogram-based predictive model for the identification of cognitive impairment in older people suffering from cardiovascular diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study included 498 participants with cardiovascular diseases aged >60 selected from the NHANES 2011-2014. The study employed the Minor Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model, in conjunction with multivariate logistic regression analysis, to identify relevant variables and develop a predictive model. We used statistical techniques as in the Minor Absolute Shrinkage (MAS) and the Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model, in conjunction with multivariate logistic regression analysis, to identify variables that were significantly predictive of the outcome. After which, based on the selected relevant variables, we developed a machine learning model that was predictive of cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's diseases in the older people. The effectiveness of the resultant nomogram was evaluated by assessing its discriminative capability, calibration, and conducting decision curve analysis (DCA). The constructed predictive nomogram included age, race, educational attainment, poverty income ratio, and presence of sleep disorder as variables. The model demonstrated robust discriminative capability, achieving an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.756, and exhibited precise calibration. Consistent performance was confirmed through 10-fold cross-validation, and DCA deemed the nomogram clinically valuable. CONCLUSION: We constructed a NHANES cardiovascular-based nomogram predictive model of cognitive impairment.

There are up to 1000 species on the surface of human skin and mucosal system, among which gut microbiota attracts the most interest. As the beginning of the digestive tract, oral cavity is also an important microbial habitat in the human body which is the first line of defense against pathogens entering the body. Many studies have revealed that oral microbial dysbiosis could not only contribute to oral diseases but also whole-body systemic diseases and health status. Oral microorganisms can enter the gastrointestinal tract with saliva and food, or enter the blood circulation through mouth breakage, thus causing systemic inflammation and aging-related diseases including some causal links to Alzheimer's disease. A series of changes take place in oral microbial composition during development, with different age stages marked by different dominant microbial species. Despite a lack of comprehensive studies on aging oral microbiota, through systemic inflammation, oral pathogenic microbes are likely to contribute inflammatory aging.

Evidence regarding non-invasive and early-stage biomarkers remains limited. Our aim was to identify retinal biomarkers for the risk of AD and FTD in populations without dementia and explore underlying brain structural mechanisms. METHODS: We included a total of 3,0573 UK Biobank participants without dementia, ocular disorders, and diabetes who underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between macular OCT parameters and the risk of AD and FTD. Mediation analysis was used to explore the underlying mechanisms affected by brain structures. RESULTS: The mean age at recruitment was 55.27, and 46.10% of the participants were male. During a mean follow-up of 9.15 ± 2.59 years, 148 patients with AD and eight patients with FTD were identified. Reduced thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) at baseline was associated with an increased risk of AD (HR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.001-1.066; P = 0.044), while thinner retinal pigment epithelial in the inner superior subfield at baseline was associated with an elevated risk of FTD (HR, 1.409; 95% CI, 1.060-1.871; P = 0.018). Structurally abnormal visual pathways, including cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes, as well as white matter integrity, mediated the association between the GC-IPL thickness and AD risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide preliminary empirical support for a relationship between prodromal changes in retinal layers and a higher risk of AD or FTD, suggesting that macular OCT may serve as a non-invasive, sensitive biomarker of high-risk years before the onset of dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading neurodegenerative diseases that affect the human population. Several hypotheses are in the pipeline to establish the commencement of this disease; however, the amyloid hypothesis is one of the most widely accepted ones. Amyloid plaques are rich in Amyloid Beta (Aβ) proteins, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. They are the spliced product of a transmembrane protein called Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP); when they enter into the amylogenic pathway, they get cleaved simultaneously by Beta and Gamma Secretase and produce Aβ protein. Appearances of Amyloid plaques are the significant clinical hallmarks of this disease. AD is mainly present in two genetically distinct forms; sporadic and familial AD. Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (sAD) is marked by a later clinical onset of the disease, whereas, familial Alzheimer's Disease (fAD) is an early onset of the disease with mendelian inheritance. Several mutations have been clinically reported in the last decades that have shown a direct link with fAD. Many of those mutations are reported to be present in the APP. In this study, we selected a few significant mutations present in the Aβ stretch of the APP and tried to differentiate the wild-type Aβ dimers formed in sAD and the mutant dimers formed in fAD through molecular modelling as there are no structures available from wet-lab studies till date. We analysed the binding interactions leading to formations of the dimers. Our next aim was to come up with a solution to treat AD using the method of drug repurposing. For that we used virtual screening and molecular docking simulations of the already existing anti-inflammatory drugs and studied their potency in resisting the formation of Aβ dimers. This is the first such report of drug repurposing for the treatment of AD, which might pave new pathways in therapy.",

The extracellular domain (ECD) of TREM2 interacts with a wide-range of ligands, yet the molecular mechanism underlying recognition of such ligands to this class I receptor remains underexplored. Herein, we undertook a systematic investigation for exploring the mode of ligand recognition in immunoglobulin-like ectodomain by employing both knowledge-based and machine-learning guided molecular docking approach followed by the state-of-the-art all atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Besides the known binding site formed by complementarity-determining regions (CDR) 1 and CDR2 loops, which enables the binding of different anionic ligands, our study identifies the presence of second binding site formed by β-strands towards the C-terminal end. We observe a dense network of hydrophobic contacts formed between the explored ligands and CDR loops and β-strands, specifically CDR1, CDR2, β-strand C', loop connecting β-strand D and E, and loop connecting β-strand E and F. Ligand binding in immunoglobulin-like ectodomain increases the conformational flexibility of CDR2 loop, thus most frequently observed pathogenic variants i.e. R47H and R62H in TREM2 may affect the development and progression of AD. Our knowledge-based and machine-learning guided docking and physics-based simulations study unveils deep insights into the endogenous ligand recognition by the positive surface ligand binding site and distant core site pave the way for exploration of other small molecules towards development of novel therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease.",

The AANCP was administered to scopolamine-injected Balb/c mice, and to BV2 microglia treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and amyloid beta (Aβ). Inflammation responses were measured via qPCR and ELISA in vitro, and cognitive functions were measured via behavior tests in vivo. RESULTS: The AANCP readily formed nanoparticles, 209.6 nm in size, with a negatively charged zeta potential. The AANCP exhibited better stability in four plasma samples (human, dog, rat, and mouse) and was slowly released in different pH conditions (pH 2.0, 7.4, and 8.0) compared with non-complexedABF. In vitro studies on microglial cells treated with AANCPs revealed a suppression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) induced by LPS. The AANCP increased microglial Aβ phagocytosis through the activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2)-related microglial polarization. The AANCP inhibited aggregation of Aβ in vitro and alleviated cognitive impairment in a scopolamine-induced in vivo dementia mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that AANCPs are more stable than ABFs and effective for cognitive disorders and neuroinflammation via modulation of M2 microglial polarization.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Inhibition of Aβ Aggregation by Cholesterol-End-Modified PEG Vesicles and Micelles.",
    "AbstractText": "Background/Objectives: This study aimed to design and evaluate Chol-PEG2000 micelles and Chol-PEG500 vesicles as drug delivery system (DDS) carriers and inhibitors of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: The physical properties of Chol-PEG assemblies were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Inhibitory effects on Aβ aggregation were assessed via thioflavin T (ThT) assay, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE). Results: Chol-PEG2000 micelles and Chol-PEG500 vesicles were found to exhibit diameters of 20-30 nm and 70-80 nm, respectively, with neutral surface charges and those physical properties indicated the high affinity for Aβ. At a 10-fold molar ratio, thioflavin T (ThT) assay revealed that Chol-PEG2000 delayed Aβ fibril elongation by 20 hours, while Chol-PEG500 delayed it by 40 hours against Aβ peptide. At a 50-fold molar ratio, both Chol-PEG2000 and Chol-PEG500 significantly inhibited Aβ aggregation, as indicated by minimal fluorescence intensity increases over 48 hours. CD spectroscopy indicated that Aβ maintained its random coil structure in the presence of Chol-PEG assemblies at a 50-fold molar ratio. Native-PAGE analysis demonstrated a retardation in Aβ migration immediately after mixing with Chol-PEG assemblies, suggesting complex formation. However, this retardation disappeared within 5 min, implying rapid dissociation of the complexes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that Chol-PEG500 vesicles more effectively inhibit Aβ aggregation than Chol-PEG2000 micelles. Chol-PEG assemblies perform as DDS carriers to be capable of inhibiting Aβ aggregation. Chol-PEG assemblies can deliver additional therapeutics targeting other aspects of AD pathology. This dual-function platform shows promise as both a DDS carrier and a therapeutic agent, potentially contributing to a fundamental cure for AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Background: A water extract of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, family Apiaceae (CAW), improves cognitive function in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer's disease and affects dendritic arborization, mitochondrial activity, and oxidative stress in mouse primary neurons. Triterpenes (TT) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) are constituents associated with these bioactivities of CAW, although little is known about how interactions between these compounds contribute to the plant's therapeutic benefit. Methods: Mouse primary cortical neurons were treated with CAW or equivalent concentrations of four TT combined, eight CQA combined, or these twelve compounds combined (TTCQA). Treatment effects on the cell transcriptome (18,491 genes) and metabolome (192 metabolites) relative to vehicle control were evaluated using RNAseq and metabolomic analyses, respectively. Results: Extensive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were seen with all treatments, as well as evidence of interactions between compounds. Notably, many DEGs seen with TT treatment were not observed in the TTCQA condition, possibly suggesting CQA reduced the effects of TT. Moreover, additional gene activity seen with CAW as compared to TTCQA indicates the presence of additional compounds in CAW that further modulate TTCQA interactions. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 4 gene co-expression modules altered by treatments that were associated with extracellular matrix organization, fatty acid metabolism, cellular response to stress and stimuli, and immune function. Compound interaction patterns were seen at the eigengene level in these modules. Interestingly, in metabolomics analysis, the TTCQA treatment saw the highest number of changes in individual metabolites (20), followed by CQA (15), then TT (8), and finally CAW (3). WGCNA analysis found two metabolomics modules with significant eigenmetabolite differences for TT and CQA and possible compound interactions at this level. Conclusions: Four gene expression modules and two metabolite modules were altered by the four treatment types applied. This methodology demonstrated the existence of both negative and positive interactions between TT, CQA, and additional compounds found in CAW on the transcriptome and metabolome of mouse primary cortical neurons.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central features of neurodegenerative diseases. The pivotal functions of VDAC1 in controlling mitochondrial membrane permeability, regulating calcium balance, and facilitating programmed cell death pathways, position it as a key determinant in the delicate balance between neuronal viability and degeneration. Accordingly, increasing evidence suggests that VDAC1 is implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and others. This review summarizes the current findings on the contribution of VDAC1 to neurodegeneration, focusing on its interactions with disease-specific proteins, such as amyloid-β, α-synuclein, and mutant SOD1. By unraveling the complex involvement of VDAC1 in neurodegenerative processes, this review highlights potential avenues for future research and drug development aimed at alleviating mitochondrial-related neurodegeneration.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques, predominantly consisting of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. The oligomeric form of Aβ is acknowledged as the most neurotoxic, propelling the pathological progression of AD. Interestingly, besides Aβ, other proteins are co-localized within amyloid plaques. Peptide analogs corresponding to the \"aggregation-prone\" regions (APRs) of these proteins could exhibit high-affinity binding to Aβ and significant inhibitory potential against the Aβ oligomerization process. The peptide analogs of co-localized protease, Cathepsin B, may act as such potent inhibitors. In silico studies on the complexes of the oligomeric state of Aβ and Cathepsin B peptide analogs were performed utilizing molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that these analogs disrupt the β-sheet-rich core of Aβ oligomers, a critical structural feature of their stability. Of the four peptide analogs evaluated, two demonstrated considerable potential by effectively destabilizing oligomers while maintaining low self-aggregation propensity, i.e., a crucial consideration for therapeutic safety. These findings point out the potential of APR-derived peptide analogs from co-localized proteins as innovative agents against AD, paving the way for further exploration in peptide-based therapeutic development.",

    "AbstractText": "The human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are ancient exogenous retroviruses that were embedded in the germline over 30 million years ago and underwent an endogenization process. They make up roughly 8% of the human genome. HERVs exhibit many physiological and non-physiological functions; for example, they play a role in the development of many diseases. They have been shown to affect carcinogenesis by modifying the expression of host genes through their functions as enhancers and promoters. Additionally, some molecules derived from HERVs may stimulate the immune system. Recently research has been focused on the effect of human endogenous retroviruses on the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common cause of dementia. AD is also linked to a significant deterioration in quality of life. The article aims to highlight the potential role of HERVs in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and senescence.

    "AbstractText": "Preeclampsia (preE) is a severe multisystem hypertensive syndrome of pregnancy associated with ischemia/hypoxia, angiogenic imbalance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated dyslipidemia, placental insufficiency, and inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface. Our recent data further suggest that preE is associated with impaired autophagy, vascular dysfunction, and proteinopathy/tauopathy disorder, similar to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the presence of the cis stereo-isoform of phosphorylated tau (cis P-tau), amyloid-β, and transthyretin in the placenta and circulation. This review provides an overview of the factors that may lead to the induction and accumulation of cis P-tau-like proteins by focusing on the inactivation of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (Pin1) that catalyzes the cis to trans isomerization of P-tau. We also highlighted the novel role of the Pin1-cis P-tau-ApoE axis in the development of preE, and propagation of cis P-tau-mediated abnormal protein aggregation (tauopathy) from the placenta to cerebral tissues later in life, leading to neurodegenerative conditions. In the case of preE, proteinopathy/tauopathy may interrupt trophoblast differentiation and induce cell death, similar to the events occurring in neurons. These events may eventually damage the endothelium and cause systemic features of disorders such as preE. Despite impressive research and therapeutic advances in both fields of preE and neurodegenerative diseases, further investigation of Pin1-cis P-tau and ApoE-related mechanistic underpinnings may unravel novel therapeutic options, and new transcriptional and proteomic markers. This review will also cover genetic polymorphisms in the ApoE alleles leading to dyslipidemia induction that may regulate the pathways causing preE or dementia-like features in the reproductive age or later in life, respectively.",

This study explores the production of fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) from three co-products: the heads and bones of black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), the carcasses of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), and the trimmings of Nile perch (Lates niloticus). Four enzymatic hydrolysis systems were tested: an endopeptidase (Alcalase, A), an exopeptidase (Protana, P), two-stage hydrolysis with an endopeptidase followed by an exopeptidase (A + P), and a single stage with endo- and exopeptidase (AP). The results show that combined enzymatic treatments, especially single-stage Alcalase and Protana (AP), achieved high protein yields (80%) and enhanced degrees of hydrolysis (34 to 49%), producing peptides with lower molecular weights. FPH exhibited significant antioxidant activity, in 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays, with EC50 values below 5 mg/mL. Additionally, AP hydrolysates demonstrated over 60% angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition at 5 mg/mL, indicating potential antihypertensive applications. Antidiabetic and anti-Alzheimer activities were present, but at relatively low levels. AP hydrolysates, especially from gilthead seabream, proved to be the most promising.

This study aimed to analyze MOP harvested in Japan for specific bioactive compounds and to explore its health applications in dogs, including effects on gut microbiota and cognitive symptoms. Methods: Flavonoid content (particularly hesperidin and nobiletin) of MOP was measured. High-flavonoid MOP was then incorporated into gelatin cubes. In the time-course blood concentration study, experimental beagle dogs received a single oral dose (4 g). For intestinal microbiota analysis and blood biochemical tests, beagle dogs were administered 1 g twice daily. For the Demonstration Test, older dogs (a 14-year-old female Shiba Inu, a 14-year-old female Miniature Dachshund, and a 19-year-old male Miniature Dachshund) were administered 1 g twice daily. Analysis included microbiota profiling via 16S rDNA sequencing and observational assessment of cognitive indicators in a pilot study involving senior dogs with Alzheimer's disease. Results: The MOP powder contained 9.3% hesperidin in early-ripening varieties (October harvest) and 6.9% in ripe varieties (December harvest). Nobiletin content was 41 mg/100 g (0.041%) and 35 mg/100 g (0.035%) for the early and late harvests, respectively. Administration of MOP-enriched gelatin cubes reduced Fusobacteriaceae and increased Eggerthellaceae. Cognitive symptoms like howling and counterclockwise turning showed improvement in senior dogs (n = 3). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary support for the potential health benefits of MOP in canine dietary applications, particularly for gut health and cognitive function.

    "AbstractText": "Neuroinflammation is a complex and dynamic response of the central nervous system (CNS) to injury, infection, and disease. While acute neuroinflammation plays a protective role by facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair, chronic and dysregulated inflammation contributes significantly to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. This review explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, are discussed alongside emerging regulators such as non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and the gut-brain axis. The therapeutic landscape is evolving, with traditional anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs and corticosteroids offering limited efficacy in chronic conditions. Immunomodulators, gene and RNA-based therapeutics, and stem cell methods have all shown promise for more specific and effective interventions. Additionally, the modulation of metabolic states and gut microbiota has emerged as a novel strategy to regulate neuroinflammation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinically viable therapies. Future studies should concentrate on integrated, interdisciplinary methods to reduce chronic neuroinflammation and slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, providing opportunities for revolutionary advances in CNS therapies.",

METHODS: This study was conducted using data from patients with an initial diagnosis of mild or moderate dementia between January 2005 and December 2022 from the IQVIA™ Disease Analyzer database. The follow-up period was up to 10 years. The association between Gbe prescription and dementia severity progression was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression, with adjustments made for age, sex, health insurance status, physician specialty, co-prescription of antidementia drugs, and co-diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 4765 patients were included, of whom 177 were prescribed Gbe.

In addition, adults with DS move slower and are not meeting the standard aerobic activity guidelines each week. The aim of this study was to examine if Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) would improve cognitive planning as measured by the Tower of London (TOL), set switching as measured by the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and spatial memory as measured by the Corsi Block Test in adults with DS as compared to self-paced cycling. METHODS: Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of two interventions over eight weeks. (1) Thirteen older adults with DS completed the ACT intervention, which is stationary cycling with the assistance of a motor to maintain a cadence at least 35% greater than voluntary cycling. (2) Eleven older adults with DS completed voluntary cycling (VC). RESULTS: Our results showed that cognitive planning as measured by total correct score in the TOL showed improvement for both ACT and VC after 8 weeks of exercise, F(1, 22) = 6.22, p = 0.021. There were no significant differences for spatial memory or set switching. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that cycling exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function, especially problem solving in older adults with DS. Our results are discussed with respect to upregulation of neurotrophic factors that increase functioning in the prefrontal cortex that accompanies exercise and leads to improvements in cognitive planning which is essential to many activities of daily living and quality of life for older adults with DS.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease, a progressively degenerative neurological disorder, is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. While its precise etiology remains unclear, researchers have identified diverse pathological characteristics and molecular pathways associated with its progression. Advances in scientific research have increasingly highlighted the crucial role of non-coding RNAs in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. These non-coding RNAs regulate several biological processes critical to the advancement of the disease, offering promising potential as therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease onset, with a particular focus on microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs associated with the disease. The review elucidates the potential pathogenic processes of Alzheimer's disease and provides a detailed description of the synthesis mechanisms of the three aforementioned non-coding RNAs. It comprehensively summarizes the various non-coding RNAs that have been identified to play key regulatory roles in Alzheimer's disease, as well as how these non-coding RNAs influence the disease's progression by regulating gene expression and protein functions. For example, miR-9 targets the UBE4B gene, promoting autophagy-mediated degradation of Tau protein, thereby reducing Tau accumulation and delaying Alzheimer's disease progression. Conversely, the long non-coding RNA BACE1-AS stabilizes BACE1 mRNA, promoting the generation of amyloid-β and accelerating Alzheimer's disease development. Additionally, circular RNAs play significant roles in regulating neuroinflammatory responses. By integrating insights from these regulatory mechanisms, there is potential to discover new therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers for early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease.

This study aimed to investigate mortality rates and causes of death in patients who underwent hip fracture surgery, and to compare them with those of the general population. A secondary objective was to compare the results of Internal Fixation versus Arthroplasty in these patients. METHODS: A population-based study collected records of 356 consecutive cases of hip fracture. For comparison purposes, data from the general population were also collected, which included residents of Adana city of 65 years and older. Causes of mortality were classified as cancer, dementia, heart disease, lung disease, and digestive disorders, among others. The average follow-up period was 4.2 years, ranging from 0 to 5 years. RESULTS: 105 (29.49%) of the surgical patients perished in one year. At the end of the follow-up, n = 308 (86.52%) of the hip fracture patients had died. Age-adjusted mortality rates after hip fracture surgery were higher for men than for women, with a risk ratio (HR) of 1.48 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 1.07 and 2.15. Complications from heart, lung, or blood vessel diseases were the leading causes of death after hip replacement surgery, followed by Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Men were more susceptible to respiratory diseases, cancer, and heart and blood vessel diseases than women.

In this study, we attempted to investigate whether these indicators are correlated in patients with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease compared with normal health individuals. For this purpose, we measured and analyzed the predictive value of heart rate deceleration capacity (DC), heart rate deceleration runs (DRs), heart rate acceleration capacity (AC) along with the plasma levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2). METHODS: We compared 83 dementia cases including 41 vascular dementia (VD), 42 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with 42 elderly health controls. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 levels were comprehensively evaluated. RESULTS: Our studies showed that DC and DRs in VD and AD groups were significantly lower than those in controls, while AC values were significantly higher. Furthermore, the risk stratification (high- and moderate-) of DC, DRs, and AC in VD and AD groups was increased, while the low-risk was simultaneously decreased. In addition, DC and DRs were positively while AC and Lp-PLA2 were negatively correlated with MMSE scores. Logistic regression analysis indicated that DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 were associated with dementia. Moreover, the areas under the ROC curves showed that the combination of five variables and AC + Lp-PLA2 were 0.970 (95% CI, 0.923-0.992) and 0.940 (95% CI, 0.882-0.974) were larger than each single indicator alone.

Accumulation of improperly folded proteins results in ER stress, accompanied by the reaction involving triggering unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is mediated through ER membrane-associated sensors, such as protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1α, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Prolonged stress triggers cell apoptotic reaction, resulting in cell death. Neuronal cells are especially susceptible to protein misfolding. Notably, ER and UPR malfunctions are linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), delineated by accumulation of misfolded proteins. Notably, ATF family members play key roles in AD and PD pathogenesis. However, the connection between ER stress, UPR, and neuropathology is not yet fully understood.

We show that this aberrant excitability is associated with a deficient adenosine tone, an inhibitory neuromodulator, driven by reduced levels of CD39/73 enzymes, responsible for the extracellular ATP-to-adenosine conversion. Both pharmacologic (adenosine kinase inhibitor) and non-pharmacologic (ketogenic diet) restorations of the adenosine tone successfully normalize hippocampal neuronal activity.

Notably, we found that CMCDs were significantly more effective than metformin in promoting the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into functional neurons under amyloid-beta (Aβ) conditions. Moreover, CMCDs fostered NSCs proliferation, enhanced neurogenesis, reduced Aβ deposition, and inhibited glial cell activation. We also examined neuronal structure by assessing Map2/NF-H/PSD95/SYN expression in the hippocampus, finding that CMCDs robustly strengthened neuronal structure. These results suggest that CMCDs can cognitive dysfunction in AD and promote the proliferation and neurogenesis of NSCs, as well as ameliorate neuronal injury.

The AD model was trained with compounds labeled for AD activity to predict active compounds at the disease level, while the acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), and 5-hydroxytryptamine 6 (5-HT6) models were trained for specific AD targets. All four models performed excellently and were used to identify potential AD agents in the Kaixinsan (KXS) formula. High-scoring compounds underwent experimental validation at the enzyme, cellular, and animal levels. Compounds like 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol and elemicin showed significant binding and inhibitory effects on AChE and MAO-A. Additionally, 13 compounds, including α-asarone, penetrated the blood-brain barrier (BBB), indicating potential brain target binding, and eight compounds enhanced microglial β-amyloid phagocytosis, aiding in clearing AD pathological substances. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in developing AD therapies and provide a strong platform for AD drug discovery.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The persistence of very low correlations between NIH research funding and disease burdens.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The degree to which the allocation of disease-specific research funding by the NIH is proportional to disease burden is an important question. This study examined the historical relationship between NIH funding allocation and disease burden for a variety of medical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Coefficients of relatedness for the linear relationships between funding and disease burden for 27 medical conditions over a period exceeding twenty years were calculated. METHODS: Publicly available data from 2009 to 2019, and previously published data from 1994 to 2004, was obtained to compare disease-specific research funding from the NIH to burden of disease values (mortality, prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and YLLs) for 27 diseases. RESULTS: We identified very weak and declining correlations (e.g., R2 < 0.03) between funding and the five measures of burden for the 27 diseases. The weak relationships persist even when HIV/AIDS is omitted (e.g., R2 < 0.1). A recent decline in the overall strengths of the funding burden relationships is attributable to novel investment in Alzheimer's disease research. CONCLUSIONS: The weak correlations reveal long-standing inefficiencies in the NIH disease funding allocation process. The recent increased and focused funding for Alzheimer's disease may not be justified by an objective analysis which considers disease burdens. Increased efficiency of medical research may be realized by improving the poor match between disease burden and funding allocation.",

    "AbstractText": "Introduction. Frailty is a common condition among older individuals and is associated with increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the impact of viral infections on frail populations. The present work aimed to determine frailty, functional and cognitive status, and clinical analysis of older persons in a long-term care facility in Chile, before and following the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods. A single-center, pre-post, and Pearson's correlational study was conducted in a cohort of 20 persons positive for COVID-19 from a total of 45 residents. Data on demographic, clinical, functional (Barthel Index (BI) and Katz) and cognitive (Mini mental Examination) status, and physiological function (hematology, lipidic and biochemical profiles) were collected. Results. The mean age was 84 ± 2.4 years, and 80% were females. The most common comorbidities were Arterial Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus type II, and Alzheimer's disease. Physical frailty was confirmed by body weight, body mass index, and calf circumference. Pre-infection, BI was negatively correlated with lipidic profile and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and positively with frailty (calf circumference). Pre-post analysis showed that frailty and most analytical results were not modified. However, functional dependence on daily live activities significantly increased as measured by BI, with worse grooming and bowel and bladder controls. Post-infection, correlations were lost except between BI and ESR, and decreased albumin levels were found. Conclusions. The worsening of specific functional limitations emphasizes the need for targeted interventions that can be correlated with ESR. Albumin appears as a potential biomarker for physiological dysfunction associated with their infectious/inflammatory processes.",

Despite their frequent appearance and their association with cognitive decline in AD, the molecular factors contributing to WMHs remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of two commonly affected brain regions with coincident AD pathology-frontal subcortical white matter (frontal-WM) and occipital subcortical white matter (occipital-WM)-and compared with age-matched cognitively intact controls. Through RNA-sequencing in frontal- and occipital-WM bulk tissues, we identified an upregulation of genes associated with brain vasculature function in AD white matter. To further elucidate vasculature-specific transcriptomic features, we performed RNA-seq analysis on blood vessels isolated from these white matter regions, which revealed an upregulation of genes related to protein folding pathways. Finally, comparing gene expression profiles between AD individuals with high- versus low-WMH burden showed an increased expression of pathways associated with immune function. Taken together, our study characterizes the diverse molecular profiles of white matter changes in AD and provides mechanistic insights into the processes underlying AD-related WMHs.",

While bacteria have traditionally been the focus of gut microbiome studies, recent evidence suggests that fungal communities (mycobiota) may also play a crucial role in modulating health, particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on the relationship between the gut mycobiome and neuropsychiatric disorders, exploring the potential of targeting fungal communities as a novel therapeutic strategy. METHODS: We summarized recent findings from metagenomic analyses that characterize the diversity and composition of gut mycobiota and discuss how these communities interact with the host and other microorganisms via the gut-brain axis. Key methodologies for studying mycobiota, such as high-throughout sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, were also reviewed to highlight advances in the field. RESULTS: Emerging research links gut mycobiota dysbiosis to conditions such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, and depression. Studies indicate that specific fungal populations, such as Candida and Saccharomyces, may influence neuroinflammation, gut permeability and immune responses, thereby affecting mental health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Understanding the gut mycobiome's role in neuropsychiatric disorders opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions, including antifungal treatments, probiotics, and dietary modifications. Future research should integrate multi-omics approaches to unravel the complex interkingdom interactions within the gut ecosystem, paving the way for personalized medicine in mental health care.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the clinical effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The measurement of brain activation links neurobiological and functional aspects but is challenging in patients with dementia. This study investigated the influence of rTMS on cortical activation in patients with AD and depressive symptoms, measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a verbal fluency task. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, patients with AD and depression received either active rTMS (n = 17) or sham-rTMS (n = 16). Patients received 4 weeks of bilateral standard rTMS (1 Hz rTMS delivered to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and 10-Hz rTMS delivered to the left DLPFC). RESULTS: No significant changes were found in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI); however, significant changes were found for the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the depression score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-depression; p < 0.05). The results showed a decrease in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin, as measured with fNIRS, from baseline to week 4 in CH41 (in right DLPFC; p = 0.0047, FDR-corrected). There was a negative correlation between the improvement in HAMD-17 severity in these patients and reduced oxygenated hemodynamic response of CH41 (r = - 0.504, p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: The results indicated a positive effect of rTMS on depression in patients with AD. The underlying cortical changes were imaged using fNIRS. Prefrontal activation measured by fNIRS is a potential biomarker for monitoring the response of patients with depression in AD to rTMS treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of age-related brain issues has risen in developed countries because of changes in lifestyle. Alzheimer's disease leads to a rapid and irreversible decline in cognitive abilities by damaging memory cells. METHODS: A ResNet-18-based system is proposed, integrating Depth Convolution with a Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block to minimize tuning parameters. This design is based on analyses of existing deep learning architectures and feature extraction techniques. Additionally, pre-trained ResNet-18 models were created with and without the SE block to compare ROC and accuracy values across different hyperparameters. RESULTS: The proposed model achieved ROC values of 95% for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 95% for Cognitively Normal (CN), and 93% for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), with a maximum test accuracy of 88.51%. However, the pre-trained model with SE had 93.26% accuracy and ROC values of 98%, 99%, and 98%, while the model without SE had 94%, 97%, and 94% ROC values and 92.41% accuracy. DISCUSSION: Collecting medical data can be expensive and raises ethical concerns. Small data sets are also prone to local minima issues in the cost function. A scratch model that experiences extensive hyperparameter tuning may end up being either overfitted or underfitted. Class imbalance also reduces performance. Transfer learning is most effective with small, imbalanced datasets, and pre-trained models with SE blocks perform better than others. The proposed model introduced a method to reduce training parameters and prevent overfitting from imbalanced medical data. Overall performance findings show that the suggested approach performs better than the state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by progressive decline of memory and cognitive functions, and it is the leading cause of dementia accounting for 60%-80% of dementia patients. A pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of aberrant protein/peptide aggregates such as extracellular amyloid plaques containing amyloid-beta peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. These aggregates result from the failure of the proteostasis network, which encompasses protein synthesis, folding, and degradation processes. Autophagy is an intracellular self-digesting system responsible for the degradation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Impaired autophagy is observed in most neurodegenerative disorders, indicating the link between autophagy dysfunction and these diseases. A massive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in neurons in Alzheimer's brains evidences autophagy impairment in AD. Modulating autophagy has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for AD because of its potential to clear aggregated proteins. However, autophagy modulation therapy for AD is not yet clinically available. This mini-review aims to summarize clinical studies testing potential autophagy modulators for AD and to evaluate their proximity to clinical use. We accessed clinicaltrials.gov provided by the United States National Institutes of Health to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials.

    "AbstractText": "Clathrin proteins, key elements of the vesicle coat, play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including neural function, signal transduction, and endocytosis. Disruptions in clathrin protein functions have been associated with a wide range of diseases, such as Alzheimer's, neurodegeneration, viral infection, and cancer. Therefore, correctly identifying clathrin protein functions is critical to unravel the mechanism of these fatal diseases and designing drug targets. This paper presents a novel computational method, named TargetCLP, to precisely identify clathrin proteins. TargetCLP leverages four single-view feature representation methods, including two transformed feature sets (PSSM-CLBP and RECM-CLBP), one qualitative characteristics feature, and one deep-learned-based embedding using ESM. The single-view features are integrated based on their weights using differential evolution, and the BTG feature selection algorithm is utilized to generate a more optimal and reduced subset. The model is trained using various classifiers, among which the proposed SnBiLSTM achieved remarkable performance. Experimental and comparative results on both training and independent datasets show that the proposed TargetCLP offers significant improvements in terms of both prediction accuracy and generalization to unseen data, furthering advancements in the research field.",

    "AbstractText": "The nuclear pore complex, a large multimeric structure consists of numerous protein components, serves as a crucial gatekeeper for the transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. Dysfunction of the NPC has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In AD, Tau aggregates interact with NPC proteins, known as nucleoporins, leading to disruptions in nuclear transport. Hyperphosphorylated Tau, a hallmark of AD pathology, interacts with central channel NUPs such as Nup62 and Nup98, causing cytoplasmic mis-localization of these proteins and impairing nuclear transport. Furthermore, Tau-NUP interactions promote Tau aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Oligomeric Tau adheres to the lamin B receptor as well as nuclear lamin, preventing nucleocytoplasmic transport and resulting in heterochromatin unwinding, DNA damage, and neuronal death. The decrease in lamin B and increasing levels of lamin A along with C in AD-affected brain areas highlight the disease's intricacy. Furthermore, Tau internalization in the nucleus and interaction with nuclear pore complexes worsen NPC dysfunction, which contributes to neurotoxicity. Tau-DNA interactions suggest a chaperone-like role for Tau in DNA organization and repair, highlighting its involvement in maintaining genomic integrity. This review explores the intricate relationships between Tau, NPC components, and nuclear lamin in the context of AD, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying Tau-induced neurodegeneration and potential therapeutic targets.",

Furthermore, it is unable to clarify the distinction between the brief association between the development and build-up of Aβ and the commencement of illness. Additionally, a number of experimental findings suggest that symptoms related to Aβ may only manifest within the framework of anabatic Tauopathies.

Due to its preferred binding to DNA sequences found in the nucleolus and pericentromeric heterochromatin, Tau has been found within the cell nucleus, where it may be a nucleic acid-associated protein. Tau has the ability to directly interact with nuclear pore complex nucleoporins, influencing both their structural and functional integrity. The interaction between Tau and NUPs highlights a potential mechanism underlying NPC dysfunction in AD pathogenesis. Pathological Tau hinders the import and export of nucleus through RAN mediated cascades. Nuclear Tau aggregates colocalize with membrane less organelles called nuclear speckles, which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and modify their dynamics, composition, and structure. Additionally, SRRM2 and other nuclear speckle proteins including MSUT2 and PABPN1 mislocalize to cytosolic Tau aggregates, and causes propagation of Tau aggregates.

Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Deep learning captures the effect of epistasis in multifactorial diseases.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction is widely used to assess the risk of diagnosis and progression of many diseases. Routinely, the weights of individual SNPs are estimated by the linear regression model that assumes independent and linear contribution of each SNP to the phenotype. However, for complex multifactorial diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and others, association between individual SNPs and disease could be non-linear due to epistatic interactions. The aim of the presented study is to explore the power of non-linear machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to predict the risk of multifactorial diseases with epistasis. METHODS: Simulated data with 2- and 3-loci interactions and tested three different models of epistasis: additive, multiplicative and threshold, were generated using the GAMETES. Penetrance tables were generated using PyTOXO package. For machine learning methods we used multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), Lasso regression, random forest and gradient boosting models. Performance of machine learning models were assessed using accuracy, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, recall, precision, and F1 score. RESULTS: First, we tested ensemble tree methods and deep learning neural networks against LASSO linear regression model on simulated data with different types and strength of epistasis. The results showed that with the increase of strength of epistasis effect, non-linear models significantly outperform linear. Then the higher performance of non-linear models over linear was confirmed on real genetic data for multifactorial phenotypes such as obesity, type 1 diabetes, and psoriasis. From non-linear models, gradient boosting appeared to be the best model in obesity and psoriasis while deep learning methods significantly outperform linear approaches in type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study underscores the efficacy of non-linear models and deep learning approaches in more accurately accounting for the effects of epistasis in simulations with specific configurations and in the context of certain diseases.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Long-Term Multimodal Exercise Intervention for Patients with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration: Feasibility and Preliminary Outcomes.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: After Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common form of early-onset dementia. Despite the heavy burden of care for FTLD, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments with sufficient efficacy remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a multimodal exercise program for FTLD and to examine preliminary changes in the clinical outcomes of the program in FTLD. METHODS: This single-arm preliminary study was conducted from July 2017 to July 2018 and recruited 4 male patients with FTLD aged 60-78 years. Patients exercised under the supervision of an exercise instructor once every 2 weeks for 48 weeks. The multimodal exercise program comprised cognitive training, moderate-intensity continuous training, strength training, balance training, and flexibility and relaxation training. Feasibility was measured using dropout and attendance rates. Cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral function tests were conducted before and after the intervention. RESULTS: All patients completed the intervention (100%) and attended well (93.6%). Positive changes in scores in the Stroop Color-Word Test (cognitive; 5 out of 6 items), Mood Check List-short form 2 (psychological), movement subscales of the Stereotypy Rating Inventory (behavioral), and Timed Up and Go (TUG, physical) assessments demonstrated a medium-to-high effect size (open effect size: 0.52-0.97). While there were improvements in some domains, such as recovery self-efficacy and exercise efficacy, the MMSE-J scores showed an overall slight decline, especially in the semantic dementia case where a marked decrease was observed. Additionally, three physical function items showed no effect, except for a positive outcome in the TUG test. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy revealed increased activation in the frontal lobe, indicated by elevated oxygenated hemoglobin levels before and after the exercise intervention. This pattern of activation suggests that the intervention may have stimulated neural activity in the frontal lobe, potentially enhancing cognitive and behavioral functions, including executive function and attention. CONCLUSION: The long-term multimodal exercise intervention may be feasible and positively change the cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral functions in older adults with FTLD. Although the intervention led to improvements in certain areas, there were also declines observed in various functions, which may not necessarily be due to the intervention itself but rather reflect the natural progression of the disease.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Threshold effects of sleep duration and cognitive function in older adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that older adults' cognitive capacities can be improved with sleep duration. However, the relationship between overweight, obesity, and cognitive decline remains a subject of debate. The impact of sleep duration on cognitive performance in seniors with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 is largely unknown. This makes it an intriguing subject to explore further. METHODS: This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2011-2014) with 2,243 participants. Weighted multivariate linear regression and smooth curve fitting were employed to investigate linear and non-linear relationships. A two-part linear regression model was used to determine the threshold effects. Additionally, subgroup analysis and interaction tests were conducted. RESULTS: Results showed that a negative association was found between sleep duration and scores in the fully adjusted model in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test, the Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST). A two-piecewise linear regression model was then applied to explore the threshold effect of sleep duration on cognitive performance. When sleep duration was less than 5 and 6 h per day, sleep duration was positively correlated with CERAD test scores [ß (95% CI): 2.11 (1.17, 3.05), p < 0.0001], AFT scores [β (95% CI): 0.25 (-0.17, 0.67), p = 0.2376], and DSST scores [ß (95% CI): 0.49 (-0.57, 1.56), p = 0.3654]. However, there was a threshold effect where sleep duration reached the three inflection points. CONCLUSION: In overweight and obese older adults, there is a clear inverted U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and cognitive function, with consistent results across different subgroups. Sleep durations of around 5-6 h may help prevent cognitive decline in older adults with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, with amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation playing a key role in its pathogenesis. Aβ-induced oxidative stress leads to neuronal damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, making antioxidative strategies promising for AD treatment. This study investigates the effects of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in a zebrafish AD model. Zebrafish were exposed to aluminum chloride to induce AD-like pathology and then treated with HRW using a nanobubble device. Behavioral assays, ELISA, Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil fluorescence labeling were employed to assess HRW's impact. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing analyzed HRW's effect on gut microbiota. HRW can significantly improve cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior in zebrafish AD model, reduce Aβ deposition (p < 0.0001), regulate liver Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) levels (p < 0.05), reduce neuroinflammation, and reduce oxidative stress. Furthermore, HRW reduced the number of harmful bacteria linked to AD pathology by restoring the balance of microbiota in the gut. These findings suggest that HRW has potential as a therapeutic strategy for AD by targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut-brain axis modulation.",

    "AbstractText": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a prevalent mood disorder characterized by alternating episodes of depression and mania, often accompanied by varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairments often serve as indicators of a bleak prognosis or the likelihood of progressing to dementia. Additionally, some studies suggest that individuals diagnosed with BD may undergo a decline in hippocampal volume. However, the potential for reversibility of these changes, particularly in adolescents, remains unclear. We present an intriguing case involving an 18-year-old male student who experiences concurrent occurrences of both BD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), accompanied by a subtle reduction in hippocampal volume. Initially, the individual exhibited impaired general cognitive function, as indicated by an IQ score of 80 on the Standard Raven's Progressive Matrices test, and demonstrated slightly reduced bilateral hippocampal volume compared to the normative reference, as determined through quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging (qsMRI). The deposition profiles of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide in the brain were not identified with 18F-AV45 PET/MRI. Following six months of combined psychopharmacological treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy, the individual's psychopathological symptoms improved significantly, leading to a restoration of his IQ score to 116 and normalization of hippocampal volume. This case suggests that the hippocampal volume reduction and cognitive impairment seen in some adolescents with BD may demonstrate greater plasticity compared to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight the potential importance of early intervention in young BD patients with cognitive impairments.",

We compared different versions of the Boston criteria for CAA diagnosis in AD. METHODS: This article presents a single-center analysis (outpatient neurodegenerative clinic) of patients with AD with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early dementia, meeting NIA-AA criteria and having biological amyloid confirmation (CSF or imaging). Two raters analyzed hemorrhagic (cerebral microbleeds, CMBs; cortical superficial siderosis, cSS) and nonhemorrhagic (severe centrum semiovale perivascular spaces, CSO-PVSs; multispot pattern white matter hyperintensities (WMHs)) markers following the original (V1.0), modified (V1.5), and latest (V2.0) Boston criteria. RESULTS: We included 75 patients (mean age 71.6 ± 8.1 years, 53% female, mean disease duration 2.6 ± 2.0 years, 91% MCI). White matter CAA markers were more common than hemorrhagic markers: 41 (55%) had severe CSO-PVSs, 28 (37%) had multispot WHMs, 12 (16%) had 1 lobar CMB, 9 had ≥2 lobar CMBs (12%), 1 (1.3%) had focal cSS, and 5 (6.7) had disseminated cSS. The prevalence of possible and probable CAA was lowest with V1.0 (14.7% and 9.3%) than with V1.5 (13.3% and 13.3%) and V2.0 (42.7% and 26.7%) criteria.

A trial unit specialized in medical care and rehabilitation (SMR) was created to handle these patients, who suffered a morbid intercurrent event not related to the neurocognitive disorder. The trial unit was created thanks to a dedicated funding from the Brittany Health Regional Agency (ARS) following-up a call for projects in October 2021.

The existence of this link has for several years inspired the study of olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD), known for the memory disorders it causes. The aim of this review is to summarize the current scientific knowledge on the almost paradoxical dual role played by odors in the management of AD, as both screening and therapeutic tools. In fact, while the existence of a specific olfactory deficit is confirmed in AD - as is its ability to screen for the disease - its properties do not prevent from taking advantage of the link between odors and memory to stimulate cognition and behavior in these patients. Current scientific data, albeit limited and with sometimes inconsistent results, suggest that this idea seems relevant. However, interventions based on impaired processing in AD, such as the recognition and naming of olfactory stimuli, must be avoided.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Astrocytes phenomics as new druggable targets in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease progression.",
    "AbstractText": "For over a century after their discovery astrocytes were regarded merely as cells located among other brain cells to hold and give support to neurons. Astrocytes activation, \"astrocytosis\" or A1 functional state, was considered a detrimental mechanism against neuronal survival. Recently, the scientific view on astrocytes has changed. Accumulating evidence indicate that astrocytes are not homogeneous, but rather encompass heterogeneous subpopulations of cells that differ from each other in terms of transcriptomics, molecular signature, function and response in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we report and discuss the recent literature on the phenomic differences of astrocytes in health and their modifications in disease conditions, focusing mainly on the hippocampus, a region involved in learning and memory encoding, in the age-related memory impairments, and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The morphological and functional heterogeneity of astrocytes in different brain regions may be related to their different housekeeping functions. Astrocytes that express diverse transcriptomics and phenomics are present in strictly correlated brain regions and they are likely responsible for interactions essential for the formation of the specialized neural circuits that drive complex behaviors. In the contiguous and interconnected hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, astrocytes show different, finely regulated, and region-specific heterogeneity. Heterogeneous astrocytes have specific activities in the healthy brain, and respond differently to physiological or pathological stimuli, such as inflammaging present in normal brain aging or beta-amyloid-dependent neuroinflammation typical of AD. To become reactive, astrocytes undergo transcriptional, functional, and morphological changes that transform them into cells with different properties and functions. Alterations of astrocytes affect the neurovascular unit, the blood-brain barrier and reverberate to other brain cell populations, favoring or dysregulating their activities. It will be of great interest to understand whether the differential phenomics of astrocytes in health and disease can explain the diverse vulnerability of the hippocampal areas to aging or to different damaging insults, in order to find new astrocyte-targeted therapies that might prevent or treat neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Xixin Decoction's novel mechanism for alleviating Alzheimer's disease cognitive dysfunction by modulating amyloid-β transport across the blood-brain barrier to reduce neuroinflammation.",
    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: Xixin Decoction (XXD) is a classical formula that has been used to effectively treat dementia for over 300 years. Modern clinical studies have demonstrated its significant therapeutic effects in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) without notable adverse reactions. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain to be elucidated. This investigation sought to elucidate XXD's impact on various aspects of AD pathology, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, neuroinflammatory processes, and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, as well as the molecular pathways involved in these effects. METHODS: In vitro experiments were conducted using hCMEC/D3 and HBVP cell coculture to establish an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. BBB damage was induced in this model by 24-h exposure to 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with 10% XXD-medicated serum, the effects of XXD were assessed through Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence techniques. In vivo, SAMP8 mice were administered various doses of XXD via gavage for 8 weeks, including high-dose XXD group (H-XXD) at 5.07 g kg-1·d-1, medium-dose XXD group (M-XXD) at 2.535 g kg-1·d-1, and low-dose XXD group (L-XXD) at 1.2675 g kg-1·d-1. Cognitive function was subsequently evaluated using the Morris water maze test. BBB integrity was evaluated using Evans blue staining, and protein expression levels were analyzed via ELISA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that XXD-containing serum, when cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h, could upregulate the expression of P-gp mRNA and protein, downregulate CB1 protein expression, and upregulate CB2 and Mfsd2a protein expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that XXD improved spatial learning and memory abilities in SAMP8 mice, reduced the amount of Evans blue extravasation in brain tissues, modulated the BBB-associated P-gp/ECS axis, RAGE/LRP1 receptor system, as well as MRP2 and Mfsd2a proteins, and decreased the accumulation of Aβ in the brains of SAMP8 mice. Additionally, XXD upregulated the expression of TREM2, downregulated IBA1, TLR1, TLR2, and CMPK2 expression, and reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors NLRP3, NF-κB p65, COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the hippocampal tissues. CONCLUSION: XXD may exert its effects by regulating the P-gp/ECS axis, the RAGE/LRP1 receptor system, and the expression of MRP2 and Mfsd2a proteins, thereby modulating the transport function of the BBB to expedite the clearance of Aβ, reduce cerebral Aβ accumulation, and consequently inhibit the activation of microglia induced by Aβ aggregation. This process may suppress the activation of the CMPK2/NLRP3 and TLRs/NF-κB pathways, diminish the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, alleviate neuroinflammation associated with microglia in the brain of AD, and ultimately improve AD pathology.",

All underwent [18F]PI-2620 tau PET. Visual read of tau PET scans was performed by three blinded raters, assessing increased tracer uptake in brain areas corresponding to the six Braak stage regions and basal ganglia. RESULTS: Visual read of tau burden revealed three tau-positive individuals which corresponded to their clinical decline while two cognitively stable individuals were rated as negative. Rating showed high inter-rater reliability for all Braak stages.

We employed publicly available genetic data; the primary estimate was determined using inverse-variance weighting, supplemented by weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and the MR-PRESSO and MR-Egger methods to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy. RESULTS: The ratio of N-palmitoyl-sphingosine to N-palmitoyl-sphinganine is linked to higher risks of insomnia (OR = 1.137, 95% CI = 1.015-1.273, p = 0.026) and AD (OR = 1.090, 95% CI = 1.005-1.183, p = 0.037).

Early prediction of whether aMCI will progress to AD is of paramount importance, as it can provide pivotal guidance for subsequent clinical interventions in an early and effective manner. METHODS: A total of 107 aMCI cases were enrolled and their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected at the time of the initial diagnosis. During 18-month follow-up period, 42 individuals progressed to AD (PMCI), while 65 remained in the aMCI stage (SMCI). Spectral, nonlinear, and functional connectivity features were extracted from the EEG data, subjected to feature selection and dimensionality reduction, and then fed into various machine learning classifiers for discrimination. The performance of each model was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score. RESULTS: Compared to SMCI patients, PMCI patients exhibit a trend of \"high to low\" frequency shift, decreased complexity, and a disconnection phenomenon in EEG signals. An epoch-based classification procedure, utilizing the extracted EEG features and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, achieved the ACC of 99.96%, AUC of 99.97%, SEN of 99.98%, SPE of 99.95%, PPV of 99.93%, and F1-score of 99.96%.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association of rest and activity rhythm with cognitive performance in older people with cognitive complaints and less education. METHODS: Activity rhythm was evaluated with wrist actigraphy in 109 community-dwelling older people with cognitive complaints without diagnosed dementia. Each participant completed a neuropsychological battery and was classified as having cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, or normal cognition. We used adjusted multinomial logistic regression and linear regression models to compare sleep and circadian non-parametric measures with cognitive groups and cognitive z-scores, respectively. RESULTS: The mean age of the 109 participants was 79.3 ± 6.3 years old, 74% were women, 68% were white, and the mean education was 5.6 ± 5.2 years. Daytime activity intensity was associated with better language (β = 0.178; 95% CI = 0.022, 0.334; p = 0.03) and visuospatial performance (β = 0.158; 95%CI = 0.008, 0.308; p = 0.04).

    "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive impairment (CI). The: Cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine ligand 12(CXCL12)/CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/CXC chemokine receptor type 7 (CXCR7) axis has emerged as a critical molecular pathway in the development of CI in these disorders. This review explores the role of this axis in the pathogenesis of CI across these neurodegenerative diseases, synthesizing current evidence and its implications for targeted therapies. In AD, dysregulation of this axis contributes to amyloid-β accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. PD studies reveal that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling influences dopaminergic neuron survival and microglial activation, affecting cognitive function. In MS, the axis modulates neuroinflammation and demyelination processes, impacting cognitive performance. ALS research indicates that the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 pathway is involved in motor neuron degeneration and associated cognitive deficits. Across these diseases, the axis influences neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival through various signaling cascades, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that modulating this axis could provide neuroprotective effects and potentially alleviate cognitive symptoms. This review highlights the potential of the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 axis as a therapeutic target for addressing CI in neurodegenerative diseases. It also underscores the need for further research to fully elucidate its role and develop effective interventions, potentially leading to improved clinical management strategies for these devastating disorders.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Untangling the complex mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease in elderly patients using high-throughput RNA sequencing data and next-generation knowledge discovery methods: Focus on potential gene signatures and drugs for dementia.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects elderly individuals. This study aimed to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying AD in elderly patients compared with healthy aged individuals using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and next-generation knowledge discovery methods (NGKD), with a focus on identifying potential therapeutic agents. METHODS: High-throughput RNA-seq data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE104704). These data were derived from healthy and diseased human brains (eight young healthy brains [young], 10 aged healthy brains [Old], and 12 aged diseased brains [AD]). We used NGKD tools such as GEO RNA-seq Experiments Interactive Navigator (GREIN) to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing the AD versus Old RNA-seq data and further filtered and normalized to obtain differentially regulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome and Panther pathways using ExpressAnalyst tool. Besides, WebGestalt was used to identify differentially regulated Gene Ontologies (GO) and the pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA software. The X2K web tool was used to infer upstream regulator networks and X2K Appyter tool for obtaining transcription factors (TFs) and kinase network information. LFW1000 and L1000CDS2 tools were used to identify specific drugs that reverse AD-associated gene signatures in elderly patients. RESULTS: Our study revealed significant downregulation of pathways related to neuroactive receptor-ligand interaction, synaptic vesicle cycle, and neuronal system in elderly individuals with AD. GO analysis showed negative enrichment of functions related to cognition, potassium ion transport, receptor-ligand activity, SNARE binding, and primary lysosomes. The transcription factors SUZ12 and REST, along with increased MAPK signaling, were identified as key regulators of downregulated genes. Several drugs and natural products, including dihydroergocristine, mepacrine, gedunin, amlodipine, and disulfiram have been identified as potential therapeutic agents for reversing AD-associated gene signatures. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis of AD in elderly individuals using RNA-seq data and NGKD tools revealed multiple differentially regulated pathways, gene signatures, and potential drugs for dementia treatment. These findings highlight the complex molecular mechanisms underlying AD and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to validate these findings and to develop personalized treatment approaches for AD in elderly patients.",

    "AbstractText": "GDP Dissociation Inhibitor 2 (GDI2) plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating Rab GTPases involved in vesicular transport. This review highlights the importance of GDI2 in various biological processes, particularly embryonic development, apoptosis regulation, cancer, and immune responses. GDI2's essential function in embryonic development is evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in GDI2 knockout mice. In apoptosis, GDI2 is implicated in the caspase pathway, influencing cell survival and death. In cancer, dysregulation of GDI2 contributes to altered tumor cell-macrophage interactions, promoting inflammation and metastasis, with GDI2 acting as a metastasis suppressor in certain cancers. Furthermore, GDI2's role in immune responses, particularly during bacterial infections, and its potential therapeutic implications in conditions like Alzheimer's disease are explored. This review emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of GDI2 and its potential as a therapeutic target in developmental disorders, cancer, and immune-related diseases.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Improving sleep in murine Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with reduced brain amyloidosis. However, the window of opportunity for successful sleep-targeted interventions, regarding the reduction in pathological hallmarks and related cognitive performance, remains poorly characterized. METHODS: Here, we enhanced slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep via sodium oxybate (SO) oral administration for 2 weeks at early (6 months old) or moderately late (11 months old) disease stages in Tg2576 mice and evaluated resulting neuropathology and behavioral performance. RESULTS: We observed that the cognitive performance of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice significantly improved upon SO treatment, whereas no change was observed in 11-month-old mice. Histochemical assessment of amyloid plaques demonstrated that SO-treated 11-month-old Tg2576 mice had significantly less plaque burden than placebo-treated ones, whereas ELISA of insoluble protein fractions from brains of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice indicated lower Aβ-42/Aβ-40 ratio in SO-treated group vs. placebo-treated controls. DISCUSSION: Altogether, our results suggest that SWA-dependent reduction in brain amyloidosis leads to alleviated behavioral impairment in Tg2576 mice only if administered early in the disease course, potentially highlighting the key importance of early sleep-based interventions in clinical cohorts.",

METHOD: The sample consisted of 16 NDPs from Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. These NDPs were retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI) database, with regular updates checked on official governmental websites. A qualitative analysis was conducted to identify common themes related to the vision, goals, and corresponding actions and measures within these strategies. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that dementia prevention is a strategic goal for most of the countries studied. Common actions identified include the identification of risk factors, advancing research, promoting healthy aging, increasing public awareness, and encouraging lifestyle interventions. CONCLUSION: We discuss the limitations and challenges of these actions, and more broadly, of the NDPs in relation to the recent literature on the most effective approaches to preventing dementia. We suggest adopting a more \"horizontal\" approach to dementia prevention, which current NDPs overlook in favor of \"vertical\" paradigms.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are complex compounds that play a critical role in neurological disorders, including the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Methylglyoxal (MG) is recognized as the primary precursor of AGEs. Methylglyoxal is produced endogenously and also introduced through dietary exposures. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of aminoguanidine (AG), semicarbazide (SC), and thiosemicarbazide (TSC) on MG-induced neurological toxicity in rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed orally to MG, MG + AG, MG + SC, and MG + TSC for 70 days. Neurobehavioral, biochemical, and histopathological changes were evaluated. RESULTS: The findings indicated that oral administration of MG for 70 days resulted in memory impairment and increased anxiety in neurobehavioral tests. Additionally, MG elevated protein carbonylation in brain tissues. Semicarbazide was found to prevent MG-induced memory problems, while both SC and AG reduced carbonyl content in brain tissues. Aminoguanidine and TSC were effective in alleviating anxiety induced by MG exposure. Histopathological analysis revealed that MG caused cell damage and neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus, particularly in the cornu ammonis 1 and 3 (CA1 and CA3) and AG, SC, and TSC improved neuronal survival specifically in the CA1 and DG areas. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that SC, AG, and TSC may offer neuroprotective effects against MG-induced neurobehavioral toxicity.

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used to manage symptoms but have limited efficacy as the disease progresses. Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach. Despite its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, its efficacy and safety remain contentious, particularly following the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) rejection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes of aducanumab in treating mild AD. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and Science Direct databases, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies focusing on aducanumab versus placebo in mild AD. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were extracted on clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and neuroimaging markers. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Out of 967 identified records, seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated a dose-dependent reduction in Aβ plaques with aducanumab, but clinical outcomes varied. High-dose aducanumab (10 mg/kg) demonstrated significant improvements in some studies but not others. Adverse events, notably amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were frequent, especially at higher doses. The studies exhibited heterogeneous treatment effects and underscored the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers as an alternative to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Aducanumab shows promise in reducing Aβ plaques and has potential clinical benefits at high doses; however, its safety profile, particularly concerning ARIA, remains a significant concern. The variability in clinical efficacy highlights the need for further research to optimize dosing regimens and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from treatment. Future studies should focus on refining treatment protocols and exploring alternative biomarkers to improve therapeutic outcomes for AD.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Recent research revealed that Tau plays critical roles in various neuronal functions. We previously demonstrated that destabilization and nuclear delocalization of Tau alter the expression of glutamatergic genes, mediating early neuronal damage. METHODS: In this study, we discovered that changes in Tau availability are linked to global alterations in gene expression that affect multiple neuronal pathways. Comparison with the human temporal region showed that the Tau-dependent modulation of gene expression closely resembles the intermediate stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that precede the definitive pathological condition. RESULTS: Furthermore, we identified the chromatin remodeling pathway as being significantly affected by Tau in both our cellular model and AD brains, with reductions in heterochromatin markers. Our findings indicate that Tau is able to globally affect the neuronal transcriptome and that its subcellular unbalance changes gene expression in the intermediate stages of AD development. In addition, we found that the chromatin architecture is affected by Tau during the progression of AD. DISCUSSION: These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying early stages of AD development and highlight the central role of Tau and the contribution of nuclear Tau in this process.",

These highly ordered, cross-β-sheet protein aggregates are found across all domains of life, playing crucial physiological roles. In bacteria, functional amyloids like curli fibers are essential for surface adhesion, biofilm formation, and viral DNA packaging. Fungal prions exploit amyloid conformations to regulate translation, metabolism, and virulence, while mammalian amyloids are integral to melanin synthesis, hormone storage, and antimicrobial defense. The stability and hydrophobic nature of amyloid scaffolds underpin these diverse biological functions. Beyond their natural roles, amyloid fibrils offer unique capabilities in biomedicine, nanotechnology, and materials science. Their exceptional mechanical strength and biocompatibility make them ideal for controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, and enzyme immobilization. The intrinsic fluorescence and optical properties of certain amyloids open up innovative applications in biosensors, molecular probes, and optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, amyloid fibrils can template metal nanowires, enhance conducting materials, and form nanocomposites by integrating with polymers. This newfound appreciation for the functional diversity of amyloids has ignited intense research efforts to elucidate their molecular mechanisms, stability, and tunable properties. By unraveling the structural intricacies of functional amyloids, researchers aim to harness their remarkable attributes for groundbreaking biomedical therapies, advanced nanomaterials, and sustainable biotechnological innovations.

    "ArticleTitle": "Role of insulin-like growth factor-2 in Alzheimer's disease induced memory impairment and underlying mechanisms.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Treatments for AD do not reverse the loss of brain function; rather, they decrease the rate of cognitive deterioration. Current treatments are ineffective in part because they do not address neurotrophic mechanisms, which are believed to be critical for functional recovery. Given that structural losses are assumed to be the root cause of cognitive impairment in AD, strengthening neurotrophic pathways may be a useful preventative therapeutic approach. Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2), which is widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), has emerged as a crucial mechanism of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, and many studies have indicated that this neurotrophic peptide is a viable candidate for treating and preventing AD-induced cognitive decline. An increase in IGF2 levels improves memory in healthy animals and alleviates several symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disorders. These effects are primarily caused by the IGF2 receptor, which is widely expressed in neurons and controls protein trafficking, synthesis, and degradation. However, the use of IGF2 as a potential target for the development of novel pharmaceuticals to treat AD-induced memory impairment needs further investigation. We compiled recent studies on the role of IGF2 in AD-associated memory issues and summarized the current knowledge regarding IGF2 expression and function in the brain, specifically in AD-induced memory impairment.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and neuroprotection is an important approach to improving AD outcomes. Rhizoma of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (RAA) is a commonly used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with demonstrated neuroprotective effects, but its anti-AD mechanism requires further exploration. AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the neuroprotective mechanism of RAA on TMT-induced AD mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD mice model was established via intraperitoneal injection of TMT. The effect of RAA on ameliorating learning and memory was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests. Haematoxylin-Eosin (HE), Nissl, and TUNEL staining were used to observe the neuroprotective effect of RAA. The components in serum containing RAA (RAA-S) were detected using UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS. Potential targets were predicted through network pharmacology and molecular docking. Serum levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured with ELISA kits. The HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line injured by l-glutamate (L-Glu) was used to further elucidate the mechanism of RAA. ROS levels in HT22 cells were detected with the 2'-7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescent probe and flow cytometry. Apoptosis in HT22 cells was measured by flow cytometry. The proteins MAP2, GAP-43, Nrf2, Keap1, HO-1, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to observe Nrf2 nuclear translocation. RESULTS: RAA significantly increased the residence time of mice in the W zone and enhanced the correct alternation rate in TMT-treated mice. RAA preserved the integrity and orderly arrangement of nerve cells. A total of 12 components were detected in RAA-S. AKT1, PPARG, CASP3, STAT3, HSP90AA1, and NFE2L2 (Nrf2) were involved in the RAA-S target pathway network. Molecular docking revealed that Nrf2 exhibited the highest average binding energy with all components in RAA-S. In vivo, RAA elevated MAP2, GAP-43, Nrf2, and HO-1 levels, along with GPx, GSH, and SOD activity, which had been reduced by TMT. Additionally, RAA reduced serum levels of MDA and ROS, which had been elevated by TMT. In vitro, RAA-S reduced HT22 cell apoptosis and ROS accumulation caused by TMT. Furthermore, RAA-S promoted the expression of N-Nrf2 and HO-1 in L-Glu-injured HT22 cells. CONCLUSION: RAA attenuated oxidative stress induced by TMT and L-Glu in AD model mice. The underlying mechanism was associated with the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1-HO-1 pathway.",

    "AbstractText": "Different neurological diseases including, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases extant momentous global disease burdens, affecting millions of lives for imposing a heavy disease burden on the healthcare systems. Despite various treatment strategies aimed at alleviating symptoms, treatments remain elusive and ineffective due to the disease's complexity. However, recent advancements in gene therapy via the CRISPR-Cas system offer ground-breaking and targeted treatment options. Based on a bacterial immune mechanism, the CRISPR-Cas system enables precise genome editing, allowing for the alteration of different genetic mutations and the possible cure of genetic diseases. In the context of neurological disorders, the CRISPR-Cas system shows a promising avenue by allowing researchers to conduct genome-editing which is implicated in neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. This book chapter provides an updated overview of the application of the CRISPR-Cas system for addressing target-specific therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, we discuss the principles of the CRISPR-Cas mechanism, its role in modeling neurological disorders, identifying molecular targets, and developing gene-based therapies. Additionally, the chapter explores the recent clinical trials and CRISPR-Cas-mediated treatments for neurological conditions. By leveraging the accuracy and versatility of the CRISPR-Cas system, scientists can more effectively handle the genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases.

In addition to its utility in Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment, the ATN framework may also have clinical relevance in identifying non-Alzheimer's pathologies. In this study conducted at Broadlawns Geriatric and Memory Center, 92 amyloid-negative profiles out of 182 patients with an ATN framework were categorized into subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (non-amnestic MCI), amnestic MCI, Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, unspecified dementia, or other memory changes based on diagnoses written in the chart. Additionally, other secondary diagnoses were found in the differential, including sleep disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders and grief, and cerebrovascular disease. The results are concordant with our expectations that amyloid-negative ATN profiles are associated with mostly non-Alzheimer's cognitive decline. We were also able to demonstrate that amyloid-negative patients have other secondary neurologic or psychiatric diagnoses related to memory or cognitive changes. However, certain enigmatic patient presentations warrant further scrutiny in the medical chart. It is possible that ATN may pose a risk of misclassification in both Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer pathologies, particularly at early stages. Future work may be required to corroborate findings using other new plasma biomarkers, such as p-Tau217. Overall, we hope that this study will provide options for early detection and future treatment of AD and other neurocognitive disorders. We also anticipate that this work will lead to the recognition of other non-neurocognitive conditions comorbid with such neurocognitive disorders.",

One example is testing of Haitian Creole speaking adults who are increasingly affected by Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, for whom few tests have been validated. AIMS: Our purpose is to describe differences in timed test performance between Haitian Creole and English-speaking participants and explore factors that may account for any differences in results found. METHODS: Data was obtained from an ongoing longitudinal driving and cognition study \"In Vehicle Sensors to Detect Cognitive Change in Older Drivers.\" Two groups consisting of 12 Creole speaking and 12 English speaking older adults were matched by age and gender. Test scores were selected from the battery of tests administered in the parent study. The measures were translated by two bilingual Creole-English researchers. Group performance on five timed cognitive tests commonly used in research was compared. RESULTS: The English-speaking group's mean scores were significantly higher than the Creole speaking group on the MoCA and the timed Animal category fluency, letter P fluency, Stroop Color Test, and Trail Making Test A and B. The most significant effects were noted in Letter P fluency, Trail Making Test A and B and Animal category fluency where the differences had large effect sizes. However, the Creole speaking group had higher mean scores than the English-Speaking group on the Stroop Color Word Test, although the difference was not statistically significant. It was not feasible to match education levels due to the differences in years of education across the groups. These results highlight the significant role of culture and linguistic context in cognitive task performance. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest performance in cognitive testing among non-English speaking groups may be impacted by cultural factors related to time perception and the testing approach employed, leading to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis. Future studies should explore the fairness of various cognitive testing approaches with Haitian older adults and other societies with cultures and educational approaches different from those of Western cultures.",

The present study sought to investigate preventive effects of EpoD on altered changes of MT related proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins induced by social defeat stress (SDS). METHODS: We measured protein expression levels of α-tubulin and its post-translational modifications, MT-associated protein 2, stathmin1 and 2 with their phosphorylated forms, and ER stress markers, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP-78) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-homologous protein (CHOP) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP) of C57BL/6J strain mice treated with EpoD (2 mg/kg) or its vehicle, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and exposed to SDS. RESULTS: We observed lower levels of acetylated α-tubulin, MAP2, p-STMN (Ser16), and GRP-78 in the PFC of the EpoD-Con group when compared to the DMSO-Con group. On the other hand, in the HIP, there were significantly higher levels of tyrosinated α-tubulin and GRP-78 in the EpoD-Defeat group compared to the DMSO-Defeat group. Furthermore, the level of MAP2 in the HIP was found to be lower in the EpoD-Con group compared to the DMSO-Con group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that EpoD exhibits a dual impact, manifesting both beneficial and detrimental effects on the aberrant changes of MT-related proteins and ER stress proteins induced by SDS, depending on the brain regions. These findings underscore the complexity of EpoD's effects, necessitating further exploration to understand its intricate mechanisms in cellular pathways linked to SDS.",

    "AbstractText": "The posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus are the core regions involved in episodic memory, and they exhibit functional connectivity changes in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that the posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus are both cytoarchitectonically heterogeneous regions. Specifically, the retrosplenial cortex, typically subsumed under the posterior cingulate cortex, is an area functionally and anatomically distinct from the posterior cingulate cortex, and the hippocampus is composed of several subregions that participate in multiple cognitive processes. However, little is known about the functional connectivity patterns of the retrosplenial cortex or other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex with hippocampal subregions and their differential vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Demographic data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 60 Alzheimer's disease participants, 60 participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and 60 sex-matched normal controls. The bilateral retrosplenial cortex, other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus subregions (including the bilateral anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus) were selected to investigate functional connectivity alterations in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis demonstrated heterogeneity in the degree of connectivity between the hippocampus and different parts of the total posterior cingulate cortex, with considerably greater functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex with the hippocampus compared with other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, the bilateral retrosplenial cortex exhibited widespread intrinsic functional connectivity with all anterior-posterior hippocampus subregions. Compared to the normal controls, the amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups showed different magnitudes of decreased functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and the contralateral posterior hippocampus. Additionally, diminished functional connectivity between the left retrosplenial cortex and right posterior hippocampus was correlated with clinical disease severity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment subjects, and the combination of multiple functional connectivity indicators of the retrosplenial cortex can discriminate the three groups from each other. These findings confirm and extend previous studies suggesting that the retrosplenial cortex is extensively and functionally connected with hippocampus subregions and that these functional connections are selectively affected in the Alzheimer's disease continuum, with prominent disruptions in functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and contralateral posterior hippocampus underpinning episodic memory impairment associated with the disease.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia and represents an increasing global burden, particularly in countries like Indonesia, where the population has begun to age significantly. Current medications, including cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, have modest effects on clinical symptoms in the early to middle stages, but there is no curative treatment available so far despite progress. Activating or repressing epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNA regulation, appears to play an important role in AD development. These alterations further enact transcriptional changes relevant to the signature AD pathologies of amyloid-β deposition, tau protein malfunctioning, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. Here, we discuss the feasibility of targeting these epigenetic alterations as a new treatment strategy due to the reversibility of epigenetics and their ability to correct faulty gene expression. We also review the combined promise of stem cell therapies and epigenetic modulation in neurodegeneration, inflammation and cognitive decline. This combined approach may provide a multifaceted strategy to slow disease progression, replace lost neurons, and restore neural function. Despite challenges, including ethical, financial, and methodological barriers, ongoing research in epigenetic modulation and stem cell therapy holds promise for pioneering therapies in AD.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The CAMDEX-DS is an instrument to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Down syndrome consisting of an informant interview and a cognitive test battery (CAMCOG-DS). Measurement properties of the German CAMDEX-DS were investigated. METHOD: Fifty-five adults with Down syndrome (19-58 years) participated in this observational study. \"Dementia\" and \"Alzheimer's dementia\" (Alzheimer's disease) were diagnosed clinically and operationalised CAMDEX-ICD-10 criteria were applied to evaluate criterion validity. Validity and reliability of the CAMCOG-DS were analysed. RESULTS: Specificity of the interview was 69-93%; sensitivity 0-80% for \"dementia\"; and 0-20% for Alzheimer's disease. A complete CAMCOG-DS score was obtained in 85% (item difficulty 0.11-0.96). Construct validity and retest-reliability were low to moderate (τ = .04-.79), inter-rater reliability excellent (τ = .70-.89), internal consistency and selectivity acceptable to excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, the CAMDEX-DS including the CAMCOG-DS are the outcome assessments for assessing dementia in Down syndrome with the best psychometric properties; however, revision is recommended.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Explainable deep neural networks for predicting sample phenotypes from single-cell transcriptomics.",
    "AbstractText": "Recent advances in single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies have revolutionized our ability to gather molecular insights into different phenotypes at the level of individual cells. The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to their unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. Furthermore, existing methods for this purpose have limitations in their usability. Those reasons motivated us to develop singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes. We used singleDeep to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease and coronavirus disease 2019. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, singleDeep outperformed traditional machine learning methods and alternative single-cell approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus. On the other hand, we discovered that genes linked to dementia have relevant roles in specific brain cell populations, such as APOE in astrocytes.",

    "AbstractText": "There is increasing pressure for researchers to reduce their reliance on animals, particularly in early-stage research. The main reason for that change arises from the different biological behavior of humans that leads to frequent failure of translating data from bench to bed. The advent of organoid technology ten years ago, along with the feasibility of obtaining brain organoids in most laboratories, has created considerable expectations not exempting frustration. In this review, we make a critical appraisal of the advantages and limitations of studying Alzheimer´s disease in brain cortical organoids derived from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While dealing with human neurons and glia in 3D poses a tremendous advantage versus murine brain cells, organoids typically lack microglia, blood vessels, immune interactions as well as proper CNS neuropil. In turn, they have relatively few oligodendrocytes and low myelination. In addition, lengthy procedures to get proper mature organoids constitute an additional limitation that may also affect the native biological properties of neurons and glia. We conclude that human brain organoids, while popular and useful, remain a model that needs further refinement before bringing substantial value to study Alzheimer´s disease.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease [AD] disproportionately affects our seniors, diminishing their health and life expectancy. As the world population grows older, the collective burden of AD has become unsustainable. Globally, there were 43.8 million patients in 2016, with a projection of affecting 152 million by 2050. Recent discoveries have shown that molecular changes characteristic to AD manifested 20 years before discernable neurological phenotypes emerge. It is feasible to halt or reverse this pathological process before reaching an irremediable stage. To take advantage of this treatment window, we need to make rapid progress in early detection and monitoring, targeted implementation of preventative measures, invention of novel therapeutics, and pragmatic ramping-up of relevant supporting policies. PET is a powerful tool for prognosis. The utilization of AI technology, on the other hand, has favorable features of low cost per capita, easy dissemination and broad scale data collection to uncover previously unknown hotspots or risk factors. FDA approved drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, have started to show efficacy to put a pause on AD progression. Additional clinical data will enable comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of these drugs.

Our study explores the role of astrogliosis in the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a key breathing regulatory center, and its impact on breathing control and AD pathology in mice. Using Tg-2576 AD and wild-type mice, we investigated the effect of silencing the transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (TGFβR II) in the RTN. We performed behavioral tests, including the Barnes maze and novel object recognition test, along with whole-body plethysmography to assess breathing disorders. Our results showed that AD mice exhibited increased apneas and cognitive impairment, which were significantly mitigated following TGFβR II gene silencing. Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated levels of GFAP and TGFβR II in the RTN of AD mice, which were reduced post-gene silencing, alongside a decrease in amyloid-beta expression in the cortex and hippocampus. These findings suggest that targeting astrogliosis and improving respiratory control may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for managing Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides the first mechanistic insights into how TGFβ signaling influences both respiratory control and AD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential benefits of stabilizing breathing patterns in AD treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "Autophagy in microglia is essential for the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. However, reports regarding the levels of autophagy in microglia have been inconsistent; some studies indicate an early enhancement followed by a subsequent reduction, while others describe a persistently weakened state. Notably, there is a lack of systematic studies documenting the temporal changes in microglial autophagy. TBC1D15, a Rab GTPase, plays a crucial role in lysosomal membrane repair, yet its function in regulating microglial autophagy in Alzheimer's disease remains unexplored. Current research suggests that microglial autophagy is activated in 3-month-old AD mice but gradually decreases by 12 months of age. Furthermore, TBC1D15 levels are significantly elevated in the lysosomes of microglia in Alzheimer's disease. Silencing TBC1D15 markedly inhibits swelling and Aβ phagocytosis in BV2 cells following Aβ treatment while simultaneously promoting autophagy and lysophagy. LIMP II/ATG8-TBC1D15-Dynamin2/RAB7 might participate in lysosome swelling of microglia in AD. These findings indicate that TBC1D15 in microglia is critical for the decline of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease. It is suggested that targeting microglial TBC1D15 may be an important strategy for enhancing autophagy, which facilitates the clearance of amyloid plaques as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.",

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of apathy on the patient's quality of life (QoL) and caregiver's burden among PwD. METHODS: Sample of this cross-sectional descriptive study consisted of 88 PwD attending the outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Istanbul and their family caregivers. The evaluation battery included Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 73.1 ± 11.7, and the time since diagnosis was 3.9 ± 3.1 years; 64.8% had Alzheimer's type dementia, and 53.4% (n = 47) had mild dementia.

    "AbstractText": "Copper (Cu2 +) dysregulation, often stemming from ATP7B gene mutations, exacerbates neurological disorders like Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Monoisoamyl 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA) shows promise in mitigating Cu2+ induced neurotoxicity by chelating intracellular Cu2+ ions, reducing oxidative stress, and restoring antioxidant enzyme function. However, challenges such as poor bioavailability hinder its therapeutic efficacy. Nano-delivery systems offer a solution by improving MiADMSA's solubility, stability, and targeted delivery, potentially minimizing off-target effects. In this study, MiADMSA was loaded into a polymer conjugated with lipoic acid (LA) and human serum albumin (HSA) using a coacervation crosslinking method.

MAOs, consisting of MAO-A and MAO-B isoforms, play crucial roles in neurotransmitter metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This study aims to optimize Linezolid's structure to transform it into a selective MAO-B inhibitor. Utilizing structure-activity and structure-toxicity relationship approaches, novel analogues of Linezolid were synthesized by replacing its oxazolidinone ring with a thiadiazole scaffold. Among the synthesized compounds, 6b emerged as a lead candidate, displaying a remarkable MAO-B inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.03 μM) and 464-fold selectivity over MAO-A, compared to the standard drugs Pargyline (IC50 = 0.14 μM) and Clorgyline (IC50 = 1.85 μM). Furthermore, docking and molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the high affinity and stability of compound 6b in the MAO-B enzyme's binding pocket. These findings suggest that optimized Linezolid analogues, particularly compound 6b, hold promise as selective MAO-B inhibitors, offering therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases while avoiding the risks associated with serotonergic toxicity.",

    "AbstractText": "Due to the tremendous heterogeneity of disease manifestations, many complex diseases that were once thought to be single diseases are now considered to have disease subtypes. Disease subtyping analysis, that is the identification of subgroups of patients with similar characteristics, is the first step to accomplish precision medicine. With the advancement of high-throughput technologies, omics data offers unprecedented opportunity to reveal disease subtypes. As a result, unsupervised clustering analysis has been widely used for this purpose. Though promising, the subtypes obtained from traditional quantitative approaches may not always be clinically meaningful (i.e. correlate with clinical outcomes). On the other hand, the collection of rich clinical data in modern epidemiology studies has the great potential to facilitate the disease subtyping process via omics data and to discovery clinically meaningful disease subtypes. Thus, we developed an outcome-guided Bayesian clustering (GuidedBayesianClustering) method to fully integrate the clinical data and the high-dimensional omics data. A Gaussian mixed model framework was applied to perform sample clustering; a spike-and-slab prior was utilized to perform gene selection; a mixture model prior was employed to incorporate the guidance from a clinical outcome variable; and a decision framework was adopted to infer the false discovery rate of the selected genes. We deployed conjugate priors to facilitate efficient Gibbs sampling. Our proposed full Bayesian method is capable of simultaneously (i) obtaining sample clustering (disease subtype discovery); (ii) performing feature selection (select genes related to the disease subtype); and (iii) utilizing clinical outcome variable to guide the disease subtype discovery. The superior performance of the GuidedBayesianClustering was demonstrated through simulations and applications of breast cancer expression data and Alzheimer's disease. An R package has been made publicly available on GitHub to improve the applicability of our method.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Tau protein plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in regulating neuronal excitability. Among tau-coding microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene mutations, the A152T mutation is reported to increase the risk of AD and neuronal excitability in mouse models. METHODS: To investigate the effects of MAPT gene expression and its mutations on neuronal activity in human neurons, we employed genome editing technology to introduce the A152T or P301S mutations into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We then differentiated them into excitatory and inhibitory neurons. As a control, iPSCs in which the MAPT gene was replaced with a fluorescent protein were also created. RESULTS: In excitatory neuronal cultures, the A152T mutation was found to enhance spontaneous neuronal activity and the association of tau and Fyn. However, in inhibitory neuron-enriched cultures, the A152T mutation did not affect neuronal activity. Inhibition of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and the reduction of tau protein levels decreased neuronal excitability in both A152T/A152T and healthy control (WT/WT) excitatory neurons. In addition, the A152T mutation increased the interaction between tau and Fyn. These findings suggest that the tau-Fyn interaction plays a critical role in regulating neuronal activity under physiological conditions, while the A152T mutation enhances neuronal activity by strengthening this endogenous interaction between tau and Fyn. In addition, transcriptomic analysis revealed structural changes specific to excitatory neurons with the A152T mutation. Common changes observed in both A152T and P301S lines recapitulated a dedifferentiation phenotype, consistent with previous reports. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the A152T mutation in the MAPT gene increases neuronal excitability through the tau-Fyn-NMDAR pathway in excitatory neurons, shedding light on its role in AD pathogenesis.",

Current medications target Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia. This study investigated Juniperus phoenicea L., a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine, as a potential inhibitor of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), an enzyme associated with dementia. METHODS: J. phoenicea phytochemicals were subjected to in silico docking against PPT1 (PDB ID: 1EH5). Docking simulations were performed in YASARA Structure with VINA scoring. Top-ranked ligands were subjected to ADMET analysis (admetlab 2.0, Protox 3.0) and PASS bioactivity prediction. Stability and reactivity were analyzed with DFT calculations (Gaussian 09), and 500 ns MD simulations (YASARA Structure, AMBER 14 force field) to assess protein-ligand complex stability. MM-PBSA was used to calculate binding free energies. RESULTS: The docking simulations identified amentoflavone (-9.6 kcal/mol) as the top hit, followed by ferruginol and quercetin 3-O-pentoside. Amentoflavone formed the most interactions (19) with PPT1. In silico toxicity analysis predicted amentoflavone and quercetin 3-O-pentoside to be safe, whereas ferruginol violated the Pfizer rule. The PASS server indicated a higher probability of activity for quercetin 3-O-pentoside (0.423) than amentoflavone (0.287) for dementia treatment. DFT calculations revealed similar electronic properties for both ligands, although amentoflavone showed slightly more favorable values. MD simulations demonstrated that amentoflavone, compared with to galantamine, had superior binding stability in the PPT1 binding pocket. CONCLUSION: This in silico study was aimed at identifying potential inhibitors of PPT1 from J. phoenicea phytochemicals, given that PPT1 is a target for developing new dementia medications. Our findings identified amentoflavone as a promising candidate for further investigation.

In recent years, it has shown great potential, particularly in the treatment of locomotor system diseases. Studies have shown that ligustilide has significant therapeutic effects on various locomotor system diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, femoral head necrosis, osteosarcoma, and muscle aging and injury.

A crucial pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which is deteriorated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuroinflammation in AD progression.

    "AbstractText": "Microglia modulate their cell state in response to various stimuli. Changes to cellular lipids often accompany shifts in microglial cell state, but the functional significance of these metabolic changes remains poorly understood. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, we observed that both extrinsic activation (by lipopolysaccharide treatment) and intrinsic triggers (the Alzheimer's disease-associated APOE4 genotype) result in accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets. We demonstrate that lipid droplet accumulation is not simply concomitant with changes in cell state but rather necessary for microglial activation. We discovered that both triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are needed for the transcription and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to extrinsic stimuli. Additionally, we reveal that triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are necessary for the activation-associated phagocytosis of multiple substrates including the disease-associated amyloid-beta peptide. In microglia harboring the Alzheimer's disease risk APOE4 genotype, triglyceride-rich lipid droplets accumulate even in the absence of any external stimuli. Inhibiting triglyceride biosynthesis in APOE4 microglia not only modifies the transcription of immune response genes but also attenuates disease-associated transcriptional states. This work establishes that triglyceride metabolism is necessary for microglia to respond to extrinsic activation. In APOE4 microglia, this metabolic process modulates both immune signaling and a disease-associated transcriptional state. Importantly, our work identifies metabolic pathways that can be used to tune microglial immunometabolism in APOE4- associated disease.",

Sika deer antler protein ameliorated AD in vivo by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The metabolome of brain and intestinal tissues and the microbiota of intestinal contents were tested and analyzed according to the microbe-gut-brain theory. Sika deer antler protein increased beneficial bacterial levels and decreased harmful bacterial levels. Correlation analyses using the gut flora-metabolomics pathway ultimately revealed that sika deer antler protein modulated the brain and intestinal tract bi-directionally via the tyrosine metabolism pathway, thereby establishing a connection within the microbe-gut-brain axis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the differential metabolite targets of the DAP4 group showed that the enriched pathways mainly included PI3K/AKT, which was consistent with the findings of the pharmacodynamic mechanisms observed in in vivo experiments. This suggests that antler protein may be involved in microbe-gut-brain interactions through tyrosine metabolism and may improve AD by activating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway. These findings add to our understanding of the microbe-gut-brain axis facilitated by sika deer antler protein and offer novel insights for further research on sika deer antler protein in alleviating AD.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Enhanced neurological anomaly detection in MRI images using deep convolutional neural networks.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and epilepsy, pose significant diagnostic and treatment challenges due to their complexity and the gradual degeneration of central nervous system structures. This study introduces a deep learning framework designed to automate neuro-diagnostics, addressing the limitations of current manual interpretation methods, which are often time-consuming and prone to variability. METHODS: We propose a specialized deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) framework aimed at detecting and classifying neurological anomalies in MRI data. Our approach incorporates key preprocessing techniques, such as reducing noise and normalizing image intensity in MRI scans, alongside an optimized model architecture. The model employs Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions, the Adam optimizer, and a random search strategy to fine-tune hyper-parameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of neurons in fully connected layers. To ensure reliability and broad applicability, cross-fold validation was used. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our DCNN achieved a remarkable classification accuracy of 98.44%, surpassing well-known models such as ResNet-50 and AlexNet when evaluated on a comprehensive MRI dataset. Moreover, performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated separately, confirming the robustness and efficiency of our model across various evaluation criteria. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and t-tests, further validated the significance of the performance improvements observed with our proposed method. This model represents an important step toward creating a fully automated system for diagnosing and planning treatment for neurological diseases. The high accuracy of our framework highlights its potential to improve diagnostic workflows by enabling precise detection, tracking disease progression, and supporting personalized treatment strategies. While the results are promising, further research is necessary to assess how the model performs across different clinical scenarios. Future studies could focus on integrating additional data types, such as longitudinal imaging and multimodal techniques, to further enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. These findings mark a significant advancement in applying deep learning to neuro-diagnostics, with promising implications for improving patient outcomes and clinical practices.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Sleep macro-architecture and dementia risk in adults: Meta-analysis of 5 cohorts from the Sleep and Dementia Consortium.",
    "AbstractText": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Poor sleep may play a role in the risk of dementia. However, few studies have investigated the association between polysomnography (PSG)-derived sleep architecture and dementia incidence. We examined the relationship between sleep macro-architecture and dementia incidence across five US-based cohort studies from the Sleep and Dementia Consortium (SDC). METHODS: Percent of time spent in stages of sleep (N1, N2, N3, REM sleep), wake after sleep onset and sleep maintenance efficiency were derived from a single night home-based PSG. Dementia was ascertained in each cohort using its cohort-specific criteria. Each cohort performed Cox proportional hazard regressions for each sleep exposure and incident dementia, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, anti-depressant use, sedative use, and APOE e4 status. Results were then pooled in random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The pooled sample comprised 4,657 participants (30% women) aged ≥60 years (mean age was 74 years at sleep assessment). There were 998 (21.4%) dementia cases (median follow-up time of 5 to 19 years). Pooled effects of the five cohorts showed no association between sleep architecture and incident dementia. When meta-analyses were restricted to the three cohorts which had dementia case ascertainment based on DSM-IV/V criteria (n=2,374), higher N3% was marginally associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR: 1.06; 95%CI: 1.00-1.12, per percent increase N3, p=0.050). CONCLUSIONS: There were no consistent associations between sleep macro-architecture measured and the risk of incident dementia. Implementing more nuanced sleep metrics remains an important next step for uncovering more about sleep-dementia associations.",

    "AbstractText": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) plays a pivotal role in diverse cellular processes and is implicated in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. However, large-scale identification of endogenous SUMO-1 faces challenges due to limited enrichment methods and its lower abundance compared to SUMO-2/3. Here we propose a novel combinatorial peptide strategy, combined with anti-adhesive polymer development, to enrich endogenous SUMO-1 modified peptides, revealing a comprehensive SUMOylation landscape. Utilizing phage display, we successfully identified a linear 12-mer and a cystine-linked cyclic 7-mer peptide ligand, specifically designed to target the C-terminal regions of SUMO-1 remnants. Building upon their high affinities and satisfactory complementarity, we developed the first artificial SUMO-1 enrichment materials, ultimately establishing a combinatorial peptide strategy that facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the endogenous SUMO-1 modified proteome in both cellular and tissue contexts. We successfully mapped 1312 SUMOylation sites in HeLa cells and 1365 along with 991 endogenous SUMOylation proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse brain tissues. Notably, our method uncovered a significant upregulation of SUMO-1 in AD mouse brain tissue, providing new insights into SUMOylation's role in disease. Overall, this work represents the most thorough exploration of SUMO-1 modified proteomics and offers robust tools for elucidating the roles of SUMO-1's biological significance.",

The associations persisted when models controlled for depression, social isolation, and/or other modifiable risk factors for dementia. The large heterogeneity across studies was partly due to differences in loneliness measures and ascertainment of cognitive status.

However, several compounds, administered parenterally and orally, are unable to reach the brain due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which prevents the passage of external substances, such as proteins, peptides, or phytocompounds, representing a limit to the development of treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. The combination of nano vesicular systems, as colloidal systems, and nose to brain (NtB) delivery depicts a new nanotechnological strategy to overtake this limit and to develop new treatment approaches for brain diseases, including the use of natural molecules in combination therapy for AD. Herein, we will provide an updated overview, examining the literature of the last 20 years and using specific keywords that provide evidence on natural products with the ability to restore synaptic plasticity alterations in AD models, and the possible application using safe and non-invasive strategies focusing on nano vesicular systems for NtB delivery.",

Emerging research suggests that NP2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and neuropathies. This literature review extensively analyzes NP2's role in these conditions, thereby highlighting its contributions to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurotoxic protein aggregation. In Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, NP2 is linked to amyloid-beta aggregation and dopaminergic neuron degeneration, respectively. Additionally, altered NP2 expression is observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, thus suggesting its involvement in synaptic dysfunction and neurotransmitter imbalance. In neuropathic pain and epilepsy, NP2 modulates the synaptic plasticity and inflammatory responses, with altered levels correlating with disease severity. Furthermore, NP2's involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) emphasizes its broad impact on neuronal health. Understanding NP2's multifaceted roles may reveal novel therapeutic targets and improve the clinical outcomes for these neurological disorders.

QOMIC transforms the MI problem using a integer model, which serves as the foundation to develop our quantum solution. We develop and implement the quantum circuit to find motif locations in the given network using this model. RESULTS: Our experiments demonstrate that QOMIC outperforms the existing solutions developed for the classical computer, in term of motif counts.

    "AbstractText": "We investigated semantic cognition in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, including (i) the status of verbal and non-verbal semantic performance; and (ii) whether the semantic deficit reflects impaired semantic control. Our a priori hypothesis that individuals with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia would exhibit semantic control impairments was motivated by the anatomical overlap between the temporoparietal atrophy typically associated with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and lesions associated with post-stroke semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia, which cause heteromodal semantic control impairments. We addressed the presence, type (semantic representation and semantic control; verbal and non-verbal), and progression of semantic deficits in logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia. Since most people with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia have Alzheimer's disease pathology and are part of a broader multi-dimensional phenotype space encompassing Alzheimer's disease sub-types, we compared semantic performance in logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease. Given the differences in lesion and atrophy patterns in semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia versus semantic-dementia/semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia patients, our second aim was to examine atrophy patterns in people with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and typical Alzheimer's disease compared to age-matched controls. Twenty-seven patients participated in the study. People were grouped into those meeting consensus criteria for logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (N = 10) and others who may have previously satisfied definitions of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia but had progressed with multi-domain cognitive impairments (herein referred to as 'logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia+'; N = 8). People with typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (N = 9) were relatively preserved across verbal and non-verbal semantic assessments. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia patients were impaired on both verbal and non-verbal semantic tasks and their impairments showed the hallmark characteristics of a semantic control deficit. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia + patients showed effects of varying semantic control demands, positive cueing effects, and correlated performance between semantic and executive tasks. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry, comparing each of the patient groups to age-matched controls, revealed significantly reduced grey and white matter in the bilateral hippocampi and lateral temporal regions in typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia group exhibited an asymmetric pattern of reduced grey and white matter intensity in the language-dominant left hemisphere, including a significant portion of the lateral and medial temporal lobe. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia + patients demonstrated reduced grey and white matter in the left temporal lobe extending sub-cortically, anteriorly and posteriorly, as well as right temporal involvement. Our findings could aid diagnostic sub-typing of primary progressive aphasia by adopting semantic control features and offer improved clinical characterization of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia in the trajectory of semantic decline.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Locus coeruleus signal intensity and emotion regulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation is seen in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus from the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease onwards and has been associated with symptoms of agitation. It is hypothesized that compensatory locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system overactivity and impaired emotion regulation could underlie agitation propensity, but to our knowledge this has not previously been investigated. A better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of agitation would help the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Using a sample of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and probable mild Alzheimer's disease dementia from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (DELCODE) study cohort (N = 309, aged 67-96 years, 51% female), we assessed cross-sectional relationships between a latent factor representing the functional integrity of an affect-related executive regulation network and agitation point prevalence and severity scores. In a subsample of individuals with locus coeruleus MRI imaging data (N = 37, aged 68-93 years, 49% female), we also investigated preliminary associations between locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios (a measure of structural integrity, whole or divided into rostral, middle, and caudal thirds) and individual affect-related regulation network factor scores and agitation measures. Regression models controlled for effects of age and clinical disease severity and, for models including resting-state functional MRI connectivity variables, grey matter volume and education years. Agitation point prevalence showed a positive relationship with a latent factor representing the functional integrity (and a negative relationship with a corresponding structural measure) of the affect-related executive regulation network. Locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios were positively associated with agitation severity (but only for the rostral third, in N = 13) and negatively associated with the functional affect-related executive regulation latent factor scores. Resting-state functional connectivity between a medial prefrontal cortex region and the left amygdala was related to locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios. These findings implicate the involvement of locus coeruleus integrity and emotion dysregulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease and support the presence of potential compensatory processes. At the neural level, there may be a dissociation between mechanisms underlying agitation risk per se and symptom severity. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings, incorporating longitudinal designs, measures of autonomic function and non-linear modelling approaches to explore potential causal and context-dependent relationships across Alzheimer's disease stages.",

Time-frequency features were extracted using the Multitaper method, followed by multidimensional reduction techniques. Subspace features (F24 and F216) were selected via t-tests and False Discovery Rate (FDR) multiple comparisons correction, and subsequently analyzed in the Time-Frequency Area Average Test (TFAAT) and Prefrontal Beta Time Series Test (PBTST). The experimental results reveal that the MSIT task achieves optimal cross-subject classification performance using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach with the TFAAT feature set, yielding a Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) of 58%. Similarly, the Sternberg Memory Task demonstrates classification ability with the logistic regression model applied to the PBTST feature set, emphasizing the beta band power spectrum in the prefrontal cortex as a potential marker of AD risk.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: A neuroinflammatory disease such as Alzheimer's disease, presents a significant challenge in neurotherapeutics, particularly due to the complex etiology and allostatic factors, referred to as CNS stressors, that accelerate the development and progression of the disease. These CNS stressors include cerebral hypo-glucose metabolism, hyperinsulinemia, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impairment of neuronal autophagy, hypoxic insults and neuroinflammation. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of DAG-MAG-ΒHB, a novel ketone diester, in mitigating these risk factors by sustaining therapeutic ketosis, independent of conventional metabolic pathways. METHODS: We evaluated the intestinal absorption of DAG-MAG-ΒHB and the metabolic impact in human microglial cells. Utilizing the HMC3 human microglia cell line, we examined the compound's effect on cellular viability, Acetyl-CoA and ATP levels, and key metabolic enzymes under hypoglycemia. Additionally, we assessed the impact of DAG-AG-ΒHB on inflammasome activation, mitochondrial activity, ROS levels, inflammation and phagocytic rates. RESULTS: DAG-MAG-ΒHB showed a high rate of intestinal absorption and no cytotoxic effect. In vitro, DAG-MAG-ΒHB enhanced cell viability, preserved morphological integrity, and maintained elevated Acetyl-CoA and ATP levels under hypoglycemic conditions. DAG-MAG-ΒHB increased the activity of BDH1 and SCOT, indicating ATP production via a ketolytic pathway. DAG-MAG-ΒHB showed remarkable resilience against low glucose condition by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, DAG-MAG-ΒHB emerges as a promising treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions. It enhances cellular health under varying metabolic states and exhibits neuroprotective properties against low glucose conditions.

LPS induce the release of cytokines by microglia and mediate the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-a mechanism also associated with amyloidosis. Curcumin is a recognized natural medicine but has extremely low bioavailability. V-Cur, a novel hemocompatible Vanadium(IV)-curcumin complex with higher solubility and bioactivity than curcumin, is studied here. Co-cultures consisting of rat primary neurons and microglia were treated with LPS and/or curcumin or V-Cur. V-Cur disrupted LPS-induced overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the in vitro aggregation of human insulin (HI), more effectively than curcumin. Cell stimulation with LPS also increased full-length, inactive, and total iNOS levels, and the inflammation markers IL-1β and TNF-α. Both curcumin and V-Cur alleviated these effects, with V-Cur reducing iNOS levels more than curcumin. Complementary insights into possible bioactivity mechanisms of both curcumin and V-Cur were provided by In silico molecular docking calculations on Aβ1-42, APP, Aβ fibrils, HI, and iNOS.

This degeneration manifests as cognitive decline, movement impairment, and dementia. Our focus in this investigation is on PD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to motor disturbances. Early detection of PD is paramount for enhancing quality of life through timely intervention and tailored treatment. However, the subtle nature of initial symptoms, like slow movements, tremors, muscle rigidity, and psychological changes, often reduce daily task performance and complicate early diagnosis. METHOD: To assist medical professionals in timely diagnosis of PD, we introduce a cutting-edge Multimodal Diagnosis framework (PMMD). Based on deep learning techniques, the PMMD framework integrates imaging, handwriting, drawing, and clinical data to accurately detect PD. Notably, it incorporates cross-modal attention, a methodology previously unexplored within the area, which facilitates the modelling of interactions between different data modalities. RESULTS: The proposed method exhibited an accuracy of 96% on the independent tests set. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models, along with an in-depth exploration of attention mechanisms, highlights the efficacy of PMMD in PD classification. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results highlight exciting new prospects for the use of handwriting as a biomarker, along with other information, for optimal model performance.

Then, the obtained compounds were screened in Ellman's assays for their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase enzyme, and for each of the active compounds, the type of inhibition was determined. The obtained results demonstrate the dependence of the activity on the triterpenoid structure and the type of substituents. The best activity for ursolic acid derivatives was observed for the 3-oxoamide 8, with an IC50 value of 0.43 µM, acting as a mixed-type inhibitor. In turn, for the oleanane type, the amide with an indole unit in the A ring 11 exhibited the best activity with an IC50 value of 0.47 µM (while the ursane-type analog was weakly active) and led to an uncompetitive type of inhibition. Thus, 3-amidoquinuclidine-triterpenoids conjugates could be considered novel inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase with a different mechanism of action.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Data-driven prediction of regional brain metabolism using neuropsychological assessment in Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant Frontotemporal dementia.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of neuropsychological assessment to predict the regional brain metabolism in a cohort of patients with amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) using Machine Learning algorithms. METHODS: We included 360 subjects, consisting of 186 patients with AD, 87 with bvFTD, and 87 cognitively healthy controls. All participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination and the Neuronorma battery, in addition to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging. We trained Machine Learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and models that incorporate genetic algorithms (GAs), to predict the presence of regional hypometabolism in FDG-PET imaging based on cognitive testing results. RESULTS: The proposed models demonstrated the ability to predict hypometabolism trends with approximately 70% accuracy in key regions associated with AD and bvFTD. In addition, we showed that incorporating neuropsychological tests provided relevant information for predicting brain hypometabolism. The temporal lobe was the best-predicted region, followed by the parietal, frontal, and some areas in the occipital lobe. Diagnosis played a significant role in the estimation of hypometabolism, and several neuropsychological tests were identified as the most important predictors for different brain regions. In our experiments, classical Machine Learning models, such as support vector machines enhanced by a preliminary feature selection step using GAs outperformed ANNs. CONCLUSIONS: A successful prediction of regional brain metabolism of patients with AD and bvFTD was achieved based on the results of neuropsychological examination and Machine Learning algorithms. These findings support the neurobiological validity of neuropsychological examination and the feasibility of a topographical diagnosis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "ArticleTitle": "EGb761 Trials for Mild-to-Moderate Dementia-What Have We Learned in the Past 18 years?",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Dementia leads to cognitive decline affecting memory, thinking, and behavior. Current pharmaceutical treatments are symptomatic, with limited efficacy and significant drawbacks. Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) is being explored as an adjuvant therapy for dementia because of its potential neuroprotective effects.Areas of Uncertainty:Despite decades of study, EGb761 has not been incorporated into treatment guidelines for these conditions. This review evaluates research futility in EGb761 trials for dementia, analyzing efficacy and methodological challenges to inform future research directions. DATA SOURCES: In this review, we investigate the efficacy and adverse reactions of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) as a treatment for Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia. We searched the randomized controlled trials published between 2006 and 2023 on PubMed and ScienceDirect. RESULTS: The 7 selected studies have shown that the degree of improvement in standard cognitive assessment scores [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), short cognitive performance test (SKT), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI)] was not significant enough for a substantial proportion of patients. Improvements of the SKT score with at least 3 points in the Alzheimer disease/vascular dementia groups were found only in 2 out of 7 studies, changes of less than 2 points in MMSE score were found in 2 of the studies, while an improvement of at least 4 points in NPI scores was reported in 4 out of 7 studies. We aim to understand why this extract has not reached the level of evidence to be included in guideline recommendation despite extensive research and what have we learned from systematic reviews performed since 2010? Studies included in this review have shown some improvement in outcome scores with EGb761 treatment compared with placebo, but these improvements did not reach the threshold for clinically significant enhancement in MMSE/SKT/NPI scores. Limitations such as small sample sizes, minimal score changes, predominantly placebo comparisons, and short follow-up durations make it challenging to determine the usefulness of EGb761 in dementia treatment. The changes observed and methodological constraints underscore the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of EGb761. CONCLUSION: The findings do not consistently demonstrate the clinical utility of EGb761, and improved scores on cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments may not necessarily translate into meaningful clinical outcomes for patients with dementia. Starting from the question \"What have we learned in the past 18 years?\", the answer would be: not much. Consequently, the question raised is: how long should we go on with the same conclusion, continuing to spend time and financial resources to replicate these results? Research strategies should be refined to optimize decision making and advance evidence-based care for neurocognitive disorders.",

    "AbstractText": "Neurological disorders (NDs), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and schizophrenia, represent a complex and multifaceted health challenge that affects millions of people around the world. Growing evidence suggests that disrupted neuronal calcium signalling contributes to the pathophysiology of NDs. Additionally, calcium functions as a ubiquitous second messenger involved in diverse cellular processes, from synaptic activity to intercellular communication, making it a potential therapeutic target. Recently, the development of the miniature fluorescence microscope (miniscope) enabled simultaneous recording of the spatiotemporal calcium activity from large neuronal ensembles in unrestrained animals, providing a novel method for studying NDs. In this review, we discuss the abnormalities observed in calcium signalling and its potential as a therapeutic target for NDs. Additionally, we highlight recent studies that utilise miniscope technology to investigate the alterations in calcium dynamics associated with NDs.",

The inability of mitochondria to transition between their dynamic forms is a critical factor in the development of pathological states. In this paper, we focus on the importance of different types of mitochondrial phenotypes in nervous tissue, discussing how mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease are \"stuck\" in certain patterns and how this pattern maintains itself. Understanding the specific roles and transitions between mitochondrial forms, including tiny, networked, and hyperfused, is crucial in developing new therapies aimed at restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. By targeting these dynamics, we may be able to intervene early in the disease process, offering novel avenues for preventing or treating neurodegeneration.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: According to the World Health Organization, 44 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal movements are atypical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. CASE DESCRIPTION: An 87-year-old woman, followed for Alzheimer's disease, experienced abnormal movements. The episodes lasted 30 minutes, were involuntary, uncontrollable, anarchic, predominantly in the upper limbs, and without loss of consciousness or bladder control. An electroencephalogram ruled out atypical epilepsy. Pharmacovigilance investigation ruled out a drug-related cause. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities suggestive of Alzheimer's disease, with no other evidence to explain the abnormal movements. Apart from the presence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid analysis found no abnormality. Dopamine transporter scan rule out an atypical parkinsonian syndrome. Finally, abnormal movements associated with Alzheimer's disease were suspected. Abnormal movements disappeared within 72 hours on low-dose carbamazepine. CONCLUSION: This case is educational both because of the clinical presentation and the management of symptoms. LEARNING POINTS: The number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of major neurocognitive disorders, is expected to reach around 78 million in 2030 and 139 million in 2050.The course of Alzheimer's disease may be punctuated by atypical symptoms, such as abnormal movements.In patients on carbamazepine, we observed a dramatic improvement in abnormal movements associated with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, incurable neurological condition characterized by cognitive decline, cholinergic neuron reduction, and neuronal loss. Its exact pathology remains uncertain, but multiple treatment hypotheses have emerged. The current treatments, single or combined, alleviate only symptoms and struggle to manage AD due to its multifaceted pathology. The developmental drugs target pivotal disease factors involved in the envisaged hypotheses and include targets such as amyloid aggregation, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and receptors like cholinergic, adrenergic, etc. Present-day research focuses on multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs), which inhibit multiple factors simultaneously, helping slow the disease's progression. This review attempts to collate the recent information related to proposed hypotheses for AD etiology. It systematically organizes the advances in various therapeutic options for AD, with a particular emphasis on clinical candidates. Also, it is expected to help medicinal chemists design novel AD treatments based on available information, which could be helpful to AD patients.",

The designed hybrid molecules were synthesized via a click chemistry approach and preliminarily screened for cholinesterase and Aβ1-42 aggregation inhibition. Among them, AS15 emerged as a selective inhibitor of AChE (IC50 = 0.047 μM) over butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE: IC50 ≥ 10 μM) with desired Aβ1-42 aggregation inhibition (72.21% at 50 μM) properties. In addition, AS15 showed protective effects against DNA damage caused by hydroxyl radicals originating from H2O2. Molecular docking and simulation studies confirmed the favorable interactions of AChE and the Aβ1-42 monomer desired for their inhibition. AS15 exhibited an LD50 value of 300 mg kg-1 and showed significant improvements in memory and learning behavior in scopolamine-induced cognition impairment mouse-based animal models (Y-maze test and Morris water maze test) for behavioral analysis. Overall outcomes suggest AS15 as a potential preclinical multifunctional candidate for the management of Alzheimer's disease, and it serves as a promising lead for further development of potent and safer multifunctional anti-Alzheimer's agents.",

The evidence showed that the progression of AD was closely related to the apoptosis of nerve cells. This study amis to explore the role and specific mechanism of miR-15a and Bag5 in the apoptosis of nerve cells induced by beta-amyloid protein (Aβ) in AD. METHODS: The AD rat model was constructed by injecting Aβ42 into SD rat brain and the AD cell model was constructed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ42. The learning and memory ability of rats was detected by Morris Water Maze. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to detect the pathological changes of brain tissues. Nissl staining was used to detect the changes of cell morphology and number in brain tissues. The upstream miRNA that interacted with Bag5 were screened by bioinformatics analysis. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate of cells. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of miR-15a and Bag5. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of Bag5, Bax and Caspase-3. MiR-15a knockdown or overexpression vectors or Bag5 knockdown vectors were transfected into AD rat model and AD cell models, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the binding relationship between miR-15a and Bag5. RESULTS: Morris Water Maze, HE staining and Nissl staining showed that the rat model of AD was established successfully, and Aβ could induce neuronal apoptosis and inhibit the expression of miR-15a in AD rats. Compared with normal cells, Aβ treatment significantly increased apoptosis rate and Bag5 expression, and weakened cell proliferation and miR-15a (all P<0.01). Overexpression of miR-15a further enhanced the effect of Aβ on cell proliferation and apoptosis, while knockdown of miR-15a expression had the opposite effect (all P<0.01). Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that there was a negative targeting relationship between miR-15a and Bag5. Compared with Bag5 knockdown alone, the co-transfection of miR-15a inhibitor and si-Bag5 significantly increased the cell proliferation ability and mRNA and protein levels of Bag5, and significantly reduced the cell apoptosis rate and the expression of Bax and Caspase-3, animal studies have also shown consistent results (all P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Aβ can inhibit the expression of miR-15a, thereby inducing the expression of Bag5 and activating the protective mechanism of Bag5 against Aβ induced apoptosis.",

The goal was to assess the scale's psychometric properties, ensuring it accurately measures caregivers' knowledge of dementia-related behavioral and psychological symptoms in a Turkish context. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the data were collected from 212 caregivers providing home-based care to dementia patients across Turkey. Participants completed a 12-item Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) knowledge questionnaire along with a sociodemographic form. To examine the factor structure of the scale, both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted. Sample adequacy for EFA was assessed using the Kaiser- Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure and Bartlett's test of sphericity. For CFA, model fit was evaluated using fit indices such as χ2/df, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The internal consistency of the scale was assessed with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: The findings showed that the BPSD-T has strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.85) and a robust factor structure. Factor loadings ranged from 0.396 to 0.744, supporting the construct validity of the scale. Item-total correlations ranged from 0.437 to 0.711, with the item \"BPSD are the major source of caregiving burden\" having the highest correlation (r=0.711). The results indicate that the BPSD-T is a reliable instrument for assessing caregivers' knowledge of behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia. CONCLUSION: The BPSD-T provides an effective means of identifying knowledge gaps among caregivers in Turkey and serves as a valuable tool for developing training programs aimed at improving the management of BPSD. This study contributes to the literature by validating the scale in a non-Western context, suggesting that enhancing caregivers' knowledge of BPSD can have positive impacts on clinical management and patient care. In this regard, the implementation of the BPSD-T may support the more effective management of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia patients.",

Extensive studies have been carried out to understand the role of fibrillar seeds on the overall kinetics of amyloid aggregation. However, the precise effect of seeds that are structurally or sequentially different from Aβ on the structure of the resulting amyloid aggregates is yet to be fully understood. Herein, nanoscale infrared spectroscopy is used to probe the spectral facets of individual aggregates formed by aggregating Aβ42 with antiparallel fibrillar seeds of Aβ(16-22) and E22Q Aβ(1-40) Dutch mutant and it is demonstrated that Aβ can form heterotypic or mixed polymorphs that deviate significantly from its expected parallel cross β structure. It is further shown that the formation of heterotypic aggregates is not limited to the coaggregation of Aβ and its isomers, and that the former can form heterotypic fibrils with alpha-synuclein and brain protein lysates. These findings highlight the complexity of Aβ aggregation in AD and underscore the need to explore how Aβ interacts with other brain components, which is crucial for developing better therapeutic strategies for AD.",

The goal of this study was to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), pooling 3 unique cohorts of older adults to 1) develop a novel measurement model that distinguishes apathy from other domains of depression including dysphoria and cognitive concern and 2) evaluate if the measurement model distinguishes older adult populations with varied risk for cognitive decline. METHODS: We pooled the baseline waves of three older adult cohorts (N=1421). With the aim of partitioning apathy from other constructs that compose the GDS and with a PCA suggesting 3-component solution, we then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using lavaan and less R. RESULTS: CFA yielded 3 factors: dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern. All the dysphoria, apathy, and cognitive concern factors showed acceptable unidimensionality with α=.76, .59, and .54, respectively. The Cognitive Risk Primary Care cohort had significantly higher mean dysphoria, apathy and cognitive concern scales. CONCLUSIONS: This culturally, linguistically, and educationally diverse sample population yielded factors with acceptable reliability and good face validity. This strategy has resulted in a generalizable measurement model to identify people at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.

With a focus on research from January 2022 to September 2023, this scoping review, which adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Scr) criteria, examines the changing landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for early AD detection and diagnosis. Forty-four carefully chosen articles were selected from a pool of 2,966 articles for the qualitative synthesis. The research reveals impressive advancements in AI-driven approaches, including neuroimaging, genomics, cognitive tests, and blood-based biomarkers. Notably, AI models focusing on deep learning (DL) algorithms demonstrate outstanding accuracy in early AD identification, often even before the onset of clinical symptoms. Multimodal approaches, which combine information from various sources, including neuroimaging and clinical assessments, provide comprehensive insights into the complex nature of AD. The study also emphasizes the critical role that blood-based and genetic biomarkers play in strengthening AD diagnosis and risk assessment. When combined with clinical or imaging data, genetic variations and polygenic risk scores help to improve prediction models. In a similar vein, blood-based biomarkers provide non-invasive instruments for detecting metabolic changes linked to AD. Cognitive and functional evaluations, which include neuropsychological examinations and assessments of daily living activities, serve as essential benchmarks for monitoring the course of AD and directing treatment interventions. When these evaluations are included in machine learning models, the diagnosis accuracy is improved, and treatment monitoring is made more accessible. In addition, including methods that support model interpretability and explainability helps in the thorough understanding and valuable implementation of AI-driven insights in clinical contexts. This review further identifies several gaps in the research landscape, including the need for diverse, high-quality datasets to address data heterogeneity and improve model generalizability. Practical implementation challenges, such as integrating AI systems into clinical workflows and clinician adoption, are highlighted as critical barriers to real-world application. Moreover, ethical considerations, particularly surrounding data privacy and informed consent, must be prioritized as AI adoption in healthcare accelerates. Performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)) for AI-based approaches are discussed, with a need for clearer reporting and comparative analyses. Addressing these limitations, alongside methodological clarity and critical evaluation of biases, would strengthen the credibility of AI applications in AD detection. By expanding its scope, this study highlights areas for improvement and future opportunities in early detection, aiming to bridge the gap between innovative AI technologies and practical clinical utility.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an irreversible progression. Currently, it is diagnosed using invasive and costly methods, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments. Recent studies indicate that certain changes in language ability can predict early cognitive decline, highlighting the potential of speech analysis in AD recognition. Based on this premise, this study proposes an AD recognition multi-channel network framework, which is referred to as the ADNet. It integrates both time-domain and frequency-domain features of speech signals, using waveform images and log-Mel spectrograms derived from raw speech as data sources. The framework employs inverted residual blocks to enhance the learning of low-level time-domain features and uses gated multi-information units to effectively combine local and global frequency-domain features. The study tests it on a dataset from the Shanghai cognitive screening (SCS) digital neuropsychological assessment. The results show that the method we proposed outperforms existing speech-based methods, achieving an accuracy of 88.57%, a precision of 88.67%, and a recall of 88.64%. This study demonstrates that the proposed framework can effectively distinguish between the AD and normal controls, and it may be useful for developing early recognition tools for AD.",

However, the pharmacological action of EGb 761® in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear and molecular mechanisms targeted in the brain are not completely understood. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate 1) the potential sex-dependent effects of oral administration of EGb 761® in 5xFAD mice, an AD mouse model, and 2) the underlying microglial subtype responsible for the observed anti-inflammatory effects in the brain. METHODS: Eight-week old 5xFAD and wild type mice received EGb 761®-supplemented diet or control diet for eight weeks. The study investigated changes in cognitive function as well as amyloid plaque load, expression of AD-related genes, and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, we used organotypic brain slices for confirmation and assessment of concentration-dependency of the observed EGb 761® effects and performed single cell RNA sequencing on the prefrontal cortex of male mice with focus on microglia. RESULTS: We demonstrate that EGb 761® treatment improves cognitive function in 5xFAD mice in several behavioral tests. Analysis of the brain tissue from these animals indicated a reduction in amyloid plaque load in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This brain area was further investigated to assess the molecular changes that occurred following EGb 761® intake. Alterations in the expression of genes related to AD were highly sex-specific with effects on the cholinergic system, the γ-secretase complex, and neuroinflammation. Anti-inflammatory effects of EGb 761® with a particularly pronounced reduction of the TNFα-response could be shown for the PFC but also peripherally in the serum of 5xFAD mice of both sexes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that EGb761® mainly affected disease-associated microglia stage 2 (DAM2), which are thought to have a detrimental role in AD. CONCLUSIONS: EGb 761® shows efficacy in the treatment of cognitive deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model via multimodal activity, including sex-specific and sex-unrelated mechanisms including the normalization of neuroinflammatory parameters.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Tau association with synaptic mitochondria coincides with energetic dysfunction and excitatory synapse loss in the P301S tauopathy mouse model.",
    "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative Tauopathies are a part of several neurological disorders and aging-related diseases including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The major hallmarks present in these conditions include Tau pathology (composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles) and synaptic loss. in vivo studies linking Tau pathology and mitochondrial alterations at the synapse, an avenue that could lead to synaptic loss, remain predominantly scarce. For this reason, using 3-month-old wild-type and human mutant Tau P301S transgenic mice, we investigated the association of Tau with mitochondria, synaptosome bioenergetics, and characterized excitatory synaptic loss across hippocampal regions (Dentate Gyrus, perisomatic CA3, and perisomatic CA1) and in the parietal cortex. We found a significant loss of excitatory synapses in the parietal cortex and hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG) of Tau P301S mice. Furthermore, we found that Tau (total and disease-relevant phosphorylated Tau) associates with both the non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria of Tau P301S mice and this coincided with synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction. The findings presented here suggest that Tau associates with mitochondria at the synapse, leading to synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction, and likely contributing to synaptic loss.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological disorder. Based on clinical characteristics, it can be categorized into normal cognition (NC), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia (AD). Once the condition begins to progress, the process is usually irreversible. Therefore, early identification and intervention are crucial for patients. This study aims to explore the sensitivity of fNIRS in distinguishing between SCD and MCI. METHODS: An in-depth analysis of the Functional Connectivity (FC) and oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) characteristics during resting state and different memory cognitive tasks is conducted on two patient groups to search for potential biomarkers. The 33 participants were divided into two groups: SCD and MCI. RESULTS: Functional connectivity strength during the resting state and hemodynamic changes during the execution of Verbal Fluency Tasks (VFT) and MemTrax tasks were measured using fNIRS. The results showed that compared to individuals with MCI, patients with SCD exhibited higher average FC levels between different channels in the frontal lobe during resting state, with two channels' FC demonstrating significant ability to distinguish between SCD and MCI. During the VFT task, the overall average HbO concentration in the frontal lobe of SCD patients was higher than that of MCI patients from 5 experimental paradigm. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that the accuracy of the above features in distinguishing SCD from MCI was 78.8%, 72.7%, 75.8%, and 66.7%, respectively. DISCUSSION: fNIRS could potentially serve as a non-invasive biomarker for the early detection of dementia.",

To our knowledge, this is the first known case of LGS along with Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) bacteremia in a neurodegenerative disease patient. The patient was an 81-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarction, and diverticulitis in a psychiatric hospital, fed via a nasogastric tube. During hospitalization, he developed a 37.4℃ temperature and disturbance of consciousness evaluated as 3 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale. A follow-up blood examination revealed a white blood cell count of 29,000/µL and a C-reactive protein value of 11.2 mg/dL. Computed tomography revealed an increased concentration of peripheral adipose tissue from the sigmoid colon to the rectum and significant quantities of stool in the rectum. Treatment was initiated with doripenem (DRPM) for sepsis of unknown focus. C. perfringens was subsequently identified in both two blood culture tests. He improved with decreased inflammatory response; DRPM was terminated after 14 days. He remains free of recurrence. We speculate that the LGS in this case may have developed from dopaminergic neuronal decrease and impaired amino acid metabolism caused by chronic hypo-inflammation due to neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's disease). We report the first known case of LGS along with C. perfringens bacteremia in a neurodegenerative disease patient.",

    "AbstractText": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature of brain disorders. Mitochondria play a central role in oxidative phosphorylation; thus changes in energy metabolism in the brain have been reported in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. In addition, mitochondria regulate cellular responses associated with neuronal damage such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), and apoptosis. Therefore, interventions that aim to protect mitochondria may be effective against brain disorders. Fucoxanthin is a marine carotenoid that has recently gained recognition for its neuroprotective properties. However, the cellular mechanisms of fucoxanthin in brain disorders, particularly its role in mitochondrial function, have not been thoroughly discussed. This review summarises the current literature on the effects of fucoxanthin on oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis using in vitro and in vivo models of brain disorders. We further present the potential mechanisms by which fucoxanthin protects mitochondria, with the objective of developing dietary interventions for a spectrum of brain disorders. Although the studies reviewed are predominantly preclinical studies, they provide important insights into understanding the cellular and molecular functions of fucoxanthin in the brain. Future studies investigating the mechanisms of action and the molecular targets of fucoxanthin are warranted to develop translational approaches to brain disorders.",

We introduce \"genome-wide association neural networks (GWANN)\" a novel approach that uses neural networks (NNs) to perform a gene-level association study with family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In UK Biobank, we defined cases (n = 42 110) as those with AD or family history of AD and sampled an equal number of controls. The data was split into an 80:20 ratio of training and testing samples, and GWANN was trained on the former followed by identifying associated genes using its performance on the latter. Our method identified 18 genes to be associated with family history of AD. APOE, BIN1, SORL1, ADAM10, APH1B, and SPI1 have been identified by previous AD GWAS. Among the 12 new genes, PCDH9, NRG3, ROR1, LINGO2, SMYD3, and LRRC7 have been associated with neurofibrillary tangles or phosphorylated tau in previous studies. Furthermore, there is evidence for differential transcriptomic or proteomic expression between AD and healthy brains for 10 of the 12 new genes. A series of post hoc analyses resulted in a significantly enriched protein-protein interaction network (P-value < 1 × 10-16), and enrichment of relevant disease and biological pathways such as focal adhesion (P-value = 1 × 10-4), extracellular matrix organization (P-value = 1 × 10-4), Hippo signaling (P-value = 7 × 10-4), Alzheimer's disease (P-value = 3 × 10-4), and impaired cognition (P-value = 4 × 10-3).

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Despite several studies having correlated Alzheimer's disease with mental health conditions, the extent to which they have been incorporated into Alzheimer's disease clinical trials remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the temporal trends in mental health-related terminology in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials as a proxy measure of research interest. Additionally, it sought to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency of these terms through pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trend assessment. METHODS: In this retrospective descriptive analysis, we included 2243 trials with a start date between 1988 and 2022 by searching for the keyword \"Alzheimer Disease\" in the U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicaTrials.gov database. A Python program was created to extract and count the frequency of four mental health terms (loneliness, depression, anxiety, and distress) by year and trial status (e.g., completed, active, recruiting). Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the yearly patterns in the appearance of the four mental health terms. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify trial characteristics associated with each mental health term. RESULTS: Our results depicted a statistically significant increasing trend in three (i.e., loneliness, anxiety, distress) of the four mental health conditions by year. A comparison between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trials showed an increase in the mention of the same three words over time. INTERPRETATION: These results may suggest a growing awareness of mental health conditions and a greater interest in considering these conditions in Alzheimer's disease trials, particularly after the onset of COVID-19. Future researchers should conduct more in-depth analyses to examine how mental health variables are operationalized in these trials, with consideration for their subsequent success.",

Because early detection is crucial for effective intervention strategies, this study investigates whether the structural analysis of selected brain regions, including volumes and their spatial relationships obtained from regular T1-weighted MRI scans (N = 168, PPMI database), can model stages of PD using standard machine learning (ML) techniques. Thus, diverse ML models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and Rough Sets, were trained and evaluated. Models used volumes, Euclidean, and Cosine distances of subcortical brain structures relative to the thalamus to differentiate among control (HC), prodromal (PR), and PD groups. Based on three separate experiments, the Logistic Regression approach was optimal, providing low feature complexity and strong predictive performance (accuracy: 85%, precision: 88%, recall: 85%) in PD-stage recognition. Using interpretable metrics, such as the volume- and centroid-based spatial distances, models achieved high diagnostic accuracy, presenting a promising framework for early-stage PD identification based on MRI scans.",

Clinical research suggests that Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia, offers a critical window of opportunity for lifestyle interventions to delay or prevent the progression of AD/ADRD. Previous research indicates that lifestyle changes, including increased physical exercise, reduced caloric intake, and mentally stimulating activities, can reduce the risk of MCI. Early detection of MCI is challenging due to subtle and often unnoticed cognitive decline and is traditionally monitored through infrequent clinical tests. In this research, the Smart Driving System, a novel, unobtrusive, and economical technology to detect early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, is presented. The system comprises a multi-modal biosensing array (MMS) and AI algorithms, including driving performance and driver's biometrics, offering insights into a driver's cognitive function.

These perennial bulbous plants possess well-known medicinal and ornamental qualities. Alkaloid diversity is their most distinctive phytochemical feature. A total of 127 compounds (≈20% of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids) grouped in 16 structural types have been previously found in Galanthus extracts. Some structural types like galanthindole, graciline and plicamine were first discovered in Galanthus plants. Nine Galanthus species, however, remain unstudied regarding their alkaloid patterns. Intraspecific variability has only been studied in G. nivalis and G. elwesii. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are molecules with anticholinesterase, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anticancer properties. Galanthamine, isolated for the first time from Galanthus woronowii Losinsk., stands out as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for medical use by the FDA for the treatment of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Lycorine, narciclasine and pancratistatin are noteworthy cytotoxic and antitumor alkaloids. Structural types like galanthamine, homolycorine and haemanthamine are fairly well studied in anticancer research, but little to no information is available on galanthindole, graciline and other types.

This plant is widely cultivated and found in north-central parts of India, several Arab countries, West Africa and tropical regions of the Eastern World. Tulsi is known to be an adaptogen, aiding the body in adapting to stress by harmonizing various bodily systems. Revered in Ayurveda as the \"Elixir of Life\", Tulsi is believed to enhance lifespan and foster longevity. Eugenol, the active ingredient present in Tulsi, is a l-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-allylbenzene compound with diverse therapeutic applications. As concerns over the adverse effects of conventional antibacterial agents continue to grow, alternative therapies have gained prominence. Essential oils (EOs) containing antioxidants have a long history of utilization in traditional medicine and have gained increasing popularity over time. Numerous in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies have provided compelling evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of antioxidant EOs derived from medicinal plants for promoting health. This comprehensive review aims to highlight the scientific knowledge regarding the therapeutic properties of O. sanctum, focusing on its antibacterial, anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, radioprotective, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neurogenesis, anti-depressant and other beneficial characteristics. Also, the extracts of O. sanctum L. have the ability to reduce chronic inflammation linked to neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The information presented in this review shed light on the multifaceted potential of Tulsi and its derivatives in maintaining and promoting health.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Amyloid peptides, whose accumulation in the brain as senile plaques is associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, are also found in cerebral vessels and in circulation. In the bloodstream, amyloid peptides promote platelet adhesion, activation, oxidative stress, and thrombosis, contributing to the cardiovascular complications observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. Natural compounds, such as curcumin, are known to modulate platelet activation induced by the hemostatic stimuli thrombin and convulxin. In this study, we investigated the ability of curcumin to modulate platelet activation triggered by amyloid peptides, and we compared its effects with those displayed on platelet activation induced by physiological agonists. METHODS: Commercial ultrapure curcumin was used, and platelet aggregation, granule secretion, phosphorylation of selected signaling proteins, and reactive oxygen species production were analyzed on isolated human platelets. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that curcumin effectively suppressed platelet aggregation induced by fibrillar amyloid peptides. This effect was associated with the reduction in intracellular signaling pathways involving PKC, PI3K, and MAPK. By contrast, platelet aggregation and activation induced by thrombin and convulxin were only partially reduced by preincubation with curcumin. Moreover, curcumin completely suppressed granule secretion only when platelets were stimulated with hemostatic agonists, but it had no effects upon stimulation with amyloid peptides. Additionally, curcumin reduced the production of reactive oxygen species induced by amyloid peptides with a stronger efficiency compared to platelets stimulated with thrombin. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that curcumin displays selective and potent inhibitory activity on platelet responses to pathological stimuli, such as fibrillar amyloid peptides.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A Narrative Review on the Neuroprotective Potential of Brown Macroalgae in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Systematic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease increasingly prevalent in the aging population. AD is characterized by pathological features such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque accumulation, tau neurofibrillary tangles formation, oxidative stress, an impaired cholinergic system, and neuroinflammation. Many therapeutic drugs have been developed to slow the progression of AD by targeting these pathological mechanisms. However, synthetic drugs, such as donepezil and memantine, can often lead to side effects. In this context, seaweeds have been drawing attention as a nutrient source and a potential source of health-improving metabolites. Studies have shown that extracts from brown macroalgae can potentially reduce the inflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine expression. Furthermore, their bioactive compounds exhibit antioxidant properties vital in combating oxidative stress. Antioxidants, mainly carotenoids and phenolic compounds, have been linked to improved cognitive function and a reduced risk of neurodegenerative disorders by protecting neuronal cells through their ability to scavenge free radicals. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids found in certain macroalgae have the potential to support brain health and cognitive function, further enhancing their neuroprotective effects. In conclusion, this review has comprehensively evaluated the research conducted on brown macroalgae in the last five years, covering their potential bioactive compounds, methods of obtaining these compounds, and their neuroprotective properties against AD. The limited number of clinical studies in the literature highlights the need for further research. This narrative review provides a basic framework for new approaches to neuroprotective strategies, such as those associated with brown macroalgae natural resources. Furthermore, they may play an increasingly important role in developing functional foods and nutraceuticals that can support human health in preventing and managing neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "AbstractText": "The brain contains many interconnected and complex cellular and molecular mechanisms. Injury to the brain causes permanent dysfunctions in these mechanisms. So, it continues to be an area where surgical intervention cannot be performed except for the removal of tumors and the repair of some aneurysms. Some agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach neurons show neuroprotective effects in the brain due to their anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In particular, some agents act by reducing or modulating the accumulation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease) caused by protein accumulation. Substrate accumulation causes increased oxidative stress and stimulates the brain's immune cells, microglia, and astrocytes, to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Long-term or chronic neuroinflammatory response triggers apoptosis. Brain damage is observed with neuronal apoptosis and brain functions are impaired. This situation negatively affects processes such as motor movements, memory, perception, and learning. Neuroprotective agents prevent apoptosis by modulating molecules that play a role in apoptosis. In addition, they can improve impaired brain functions by supporting neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Due to the important roles that these agents play in central nervous system damage or neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to elucidate many mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms of flavonoids, which constitute a large part of the agents with neuroprotective effects, as well as vitamins, neurotransmitters, hormones, amino acids, and their derivatives. It is thought that understanding these mechanisms will enable the development of new therapeutic agents and different treatment strategies.",

Lifestyle interventions, particularly dietary habits, offer promising strategies for enhancing cognitive performance and preventing cognitive decline. METHODS: This study utilized data from the UK Biobank cohort (n = 12,025) to examine the associations between filtered coffee, green tea, and standard tea consumption and neural network functional connectivity across seven resting-state networks. We focused on networks spanning prefrontal and occipital areas that are linked to complex cognitive and behavioral functions. Linear mixed models were used to assess the main effects of coffee and tea consumption, as well as their interactions with Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic risk-the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Higher filtered coffee consumption was associated with increased functional connectivity in several networks, including Motor Execution, Sensorimotor, Fronto-Cingular, and a Prefrontal + 'What' Pathway Network. Similarly, greater green tea intake was associated with enhanced connectivity in the Extrastriate Visual and Primary Visual Networks. In contrast, higher standard tea consumption was linked to reduced connectivity in networks such as Memory Consolidation, Motor Execution, Fronto-Cingular, and the \"What\" Pathway + Prefrontal Network. The APOE4 genotype and family history of AD influenced the relationship between coffee intake and connectivity in the Memory Consolidation Network. Additionally, the APOE4 genotype modified the association between standard tea consumption and connectivity in the Sensorimotor Network. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct patterns of association between coffee, green tea, and standard tea consumption and resting-state brain activity may provide insights into AD-related brain changes. The APOE4 genotype, in particular, appears to play a significant role in modulating these relationships. These findings enhance our knowledge of how commonly consumed beverages may influence cognitive function and potentially AD risk among older adults.",

This hypothesis generating this narrative review will examine the important role for the use of sodium thiosulfate (STS) as a possible multi-targeting treatment option for LOAD. Sulfur is widely available in our environment and is responsible for forming organosulfur compounds that are known to be associated with a wide range of biological activities in the brain. STS is known to have (i) antioxidant and (ii) anti-inflammatory properties; (iii) chelation properties for calcium and the pro-oxidative cation metals such as iron and copper; (iv) donor properties for hydrogen sulfide production; (v) possible restorative properties for brain endothelial-cell-derived bioavailable nitric oxide. Thus, it becomes apparent that STS has the potential for neuroprotection and neuromodulation and may allow for an attenuation of the progressive nature of neurodegeneration and impaired cognition in LOAD. STS has been successfully used to prevent cisplatin oxidative-stress-induced ototoxicity in the treatment of head and neck and solid cancers, cyanide and arsenic poisoning, and fungal skin diseases. Most recently, intravenous STS has become part of the treatment plan for calciphylaxis globally due to vascular calcification and ischemia-induced skin necrosis and ulceration. Side effects have been minimal with reports of metabolic acidosis and increased anion gap; as with any drug treatment, there is also the possibility of allergic reactions, possible long-term osteoporosis from animal studies to date, and minor side-effects of nausea, headache, and rhinorrhea if infused too rapidly. While STS poorly penetrates the intact blood-brain barrier(s) (BBBs), it could readily penetrate BBBs that are dysfunctional and disrupted to deliver its neuroprotective and neuromodulating effects in addition to its ability to penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the choroid plexus. Novel strategies such as the future use of nano-technology may be helpful in allowing an increased entry of STS into the brain.",

Curcuma longa L., commonly known as turmeric, exemplifies such herbal remedies with its extensive history of culinary and medicinal applications across Asia for thousands of years. Traditionally utilized as a dye, flavoring, and in cultural rituals, turmeric has also been employed to treat a spectrum of medical conditions, including inflammatory, bacterial, and fungal infections, jaundice, tumors, and ulcers. Building on this longstanding use, contemporary biochemical and clinical research has identified curcumin-the primary active compound in turmeric-as possessing significant therapeutic potential. This review hypothesizes that curcumin's antioxidant properties are pivotal in preventing and treating chronic inflammatory diseases, which are often precursors to more severe conditions, such as cancer, and neurological disorders, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, while curcumin demonstrates a favorable safety profile, its anticoagulant effects warrant cautious application. This article synthesizes recent studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin's actions and evaluates its therapeutic efficacy in various human illnesses, including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, peptic ulcers, COVID-19, psoriasis, vitiligo, and depression.

    "AbstractText": "The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ), which is produced when the amyloid precursor protein (APP) misfolds and deposits as neurotoxic plaques in the brain. A functional iron responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop is encoded by the APP 5'-UTR and may be a target for regulating the production of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. Since modifying Aβ protein expression can give anti-amyloid efficacy and protective brain iron balance, targeted regulation of amyloid protein synthesis through modulation of 5'-UTR sequence function is a novel method for the prospective therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Numerous mRNA interference strategies target the 2D RNA structure, even though messenger RNAs like tRNAs and rRNAs can fold into complex, three-dimensional structures, adding even another level of complexity. The IRE family is among the few known 3D mRNA regulatory elements. This review seeks to describe the structural and functional aspects of IREs in transcripts, including that of the amyloid precursor protein, that are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The mRNAs encoding the proteins involved in iron metabolism are controlled by this family of similar base sequences. Like ferritin IRE RNA in their 5'-UTR, iron controls the production of APP in their 5'-UTR. Iron misregulation by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) can also be investigated and contrasted using measurements of the expression levels of tau production, Aβ, and APP. The development of AD is aided by iron binding to Aβ, which promotes Aβ aggregation. The development of small chemical therapeutics to control IRE-modulated expression of APP is increasingly thought to target messenger RNAs. Thus, IRE-modulated APP expression in AD has important therapeutic implications by targeting mRNA structures.",

Initially, the clinical adoption of FBB PET faced significant barriers, including reimbursement challenges and uncertainties regarding its integration into diagnostic clinical practice. This review examines the progress made in overcoming these obstacles and describes the concurrent evolution of the diagnostic landscape. Advances in quantification methods have further strengthened the traditional visual assessment approach. Over the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged, demonstrating that amyloid PET has a strong impact on AD diagnosis, management, and outcomes across diverse clinical scenarios, even in the absence of amyloid-targeted therapies. Amyloid PET imaging has become essential in clinical trials and the application of new AD therapeutics, particularly for confirming eligibility criteria (i.e., the presence of amyloid plaques) and monitoring biological responses to amyloid-lowering therapies. Since its approval, FBB PET has transitioned from a purely diagnostic tool aimed primarily at excluding amyloid pathology to a critical component in AD drug development, and today, it is essential in the diagnostic workup and therapy management of approved AD treatments.",

    "AbstractText": "Background/Objectives: Tacrine is a centrally active non-competitive reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It also exerts antagonising activity against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Tacrine was approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in 1993, but was withdrawn from clinical use in 2013 because of its hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal side effects. Nevertheless, tacrine is currently facing a renewed wave of interest primarily due to several new tacrine-incorporated hybrids and derivates. There were two specific aims for this study: firstly, to explain the mechanisms of the adverse action of tacrine, as a distinctive example of a highly effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; and secondly to check whether luminal impedance planimetry is feasible for preclinical testing of possible side effects of compounds potentially toxic to the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: Six experimental pigs were used as the animal model in this study. Five major parameters were evaluated: luminal pressure (mmHg), estimated diameter (mm), cross-sectional area (mm2), distensibility (mm2/mmHg), and zone compliance (mm3/mmHg). All measurements were performed before and 360 min after intragastric administration of 200 mg tacrine (at the porcine tacrine Tmax). Results: This study consistently demonstrated an increase in luminal pressure (a directly measured indicator) for the particular balloon filling volumes used, and inversely a reciprocal decrease in the other parameters after tacrine administration. Conclusions: Endoscopic luminal impedance planimetry is a feasible method to evaluate functional response of the lower oesophageal sphincter to tacrine in experimental pigs. Tacrine did not compromise the function of the lower oesophageal sphincter either toward oesophageal spasms or, in contrast, decreased competence of the lower oesophageal sphincter.",

    "AbstractText": "This review synthesizes the findings from 252 studies to explore the relationship between the oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, dental caries, and systemic diseases. Individuals with oral diseases, such as periodontitis, are between 1.7 and 7.5 times (average 3.3 times) more likely to develop systemic diseases or suffer adverse pregnancy outcomes, underscoring the critical connection between dental and overall health. Oral conditions such as periodontitis and dental caries represent a significant health burden, affecting 26-47% of Americans. The most important oral pathogens, ranked by publication frequency, include the herpes virus, C. albicans, S. mutans, P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, T. denticola, and T. forsythia. The systemic diseases and disorders linked to oral infections, ranked similarly, include cancer, respiratory, liver, bowel, fever, kidney, complications in pregnancy, cardiovascular bacteremia, diabetes, arthritis, autoimmune, bladder, dementia, lupus, and Alzheimer's diseases. Evidence supports the efficacy of dental and periodontal treatments in eliminating oral infections and reducing the severity of systemic diseases. The substantial burden that oral pathogens have on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and other systemic diseases poses a significant public health crisis.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive dysfunction, memory decline, and behavioral disturbance, and it is pathologically characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Although various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of AD, including the amyloid beta hypothesis, oxidative stress hypothesis, and abnormal phosphorylation of tau proteins, the exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD remain largely undefined. Furthermore, effective curative treatments are very limited. Epidemiologic studies provide convincing evidence for a significant association between type 2 diabetes and AD. Here, we showed energy metabolism using glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, and lipids as energy substrates in a normal brain, and changes in such energy metabolism due to type 2 diabetes. We also showed the influences of such altered energy metabolism due to type 2 diabetes on the pathology of AD. Furthermore, we comprehensively searched for risk factors related with type 2 diabetes for AD and showed possible therapeutic interventions based on considering risk factors and altered brain energy metabolism due to type 2 diabetes for the development of AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Aging and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) are the two most significant risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Compared to APOE3, APOE4 disrupts cholesterol homeostasis, increases cholesteryl esters (CEs), and exacerbates neuroinflammation in brain cells, including microglia. Targeting CEs and neuroinflammation could be a novel strategy to ameliorate APOE4-dependent phenotypes. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key macromolecule in inflammation, and its regulation is associated with the cholesterol content of lipid rafts in cell membranes. We previously demonstrated that in normal microglia expressing APOE3, inhibiting the cholesterol storage enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1/SOAT1) reduces CEs, dampened neuroinflammation via modulating the fate of TLR4. We also showed that treating myelin debris-loaded normal microglia with ACAT inhibitor F12511 reduced cellular CEs and activated ABC transporter 1 (ABCA1) for cholesterol efflux. This study found that treating primary microglia expressing APOE4 with F12511 also reduces CEs, activates ABCA1, and dampens LPS-dependent NFκB activation. In vivo, two-week injections of nanoparticle F12511, which consists of DSPE-PEG2000, phosphatidylcholine, and F12511, to aged female APOE4 mice reduced TLR4 protein content and decreased proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β in mice brains. Overall, our work suggests nanoparticle F12511 is a novel agent to ameliorate LOAD.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease mainly caused by β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. Among the several factors that may concur to AD development, elevated cholesterol levels and brain cholesterol dyshomeostasis have been recognized to play a relevant role. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein primarily known to regulate plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) rich in cholesterol and to be one of the main causes of familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition to that, PCSK9 is also recognized to carry out diverse important activities in the brain, including control of neuronal differentiation, apoptosis, and, importantly, LDL receptors functionality. Moreover, PCSK9 appeared to be directly involved in some of the principal processes responsible for AD development, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ deposition. On these bases, PCSK9 management might represent a promising approach for AD treatment. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the role of PCSK9, whether or not cholesterol-related, in AD pathogenesis and to give an updated overview of the most innovative therapeutic strategies developed so far to counteract the pleiotropic activities of both humoral and brain PCSK9, focusing in particular on their potentiality for AD management.",

It has been established that neurogranin is involved in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation.

Physical exercise is part of the non-pharmacological treatments used in Alzheimer's disease, as it has been shown to delay the neurodegenerative process by improving the redox state in brain tissue, providing anti-inflammatory effects or stimulating the release of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor that enhances the brain structure and cognitive performance. Here, we reviewed the results obtained from studies conducted in both animal models and human subjects to comprehend how physical exercise interventions can exert changes in the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease: amyloid β-peptide pathology, tau pathology, neuroglial changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Physical exercise seems to have a protective effect against Alzheimer's disease, since it has been shown to induce positive changes in some of the biomarkers related to the pathophysiological processes of the disease.

This review explores its potential across various pathophysiological processes that are often considered independent. Elevated in healthy states but reduced in diseases, irisin improves muscle-adipose communication, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic balance by enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. It promotes osteogenesis and mitigates bone loss in osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Irisin exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling and countering insulin resistance. In the brain, it reduces amyloid-β toxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, which improves cognition and synaptic health in AD models. It also regulates dopamine pathways, potentially alleviating neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and apathy. By linking physical activity to systemic health, irisin emphasizes its role in the muscle-bone-brain axis. Its multifaceted benefits highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for AD and related disorders, with applications in prevention, in treatment, and as a complement to exercise strategies.",

The unsupervised learning rank aggregation algorithm from SemNet 2.0 compared the most important amino acid, peptide, and protein (AAPP) nodes connected to AD, ALS, or FTD. FTD shared 99.9% of its nodes with ALS and AD; AD shared 64.2% of its nodes with FTD and ALS; and ALS shared 68.3% of its nodes with AD and FTD. The results were validated and mapped to functional biological processes using supervised human supervision and an external large language model. The overall percentages of mapped intersecting biological processes were as follows: inflammation and immune response, 19%; synapse and neurotransmission, 19%; cell cycle, 15%; protein aggregation, 12%; membrane regulation, 11%; stress response and regulation, 9%; and gene regulation, 4%. Once normalized for node count, biological mappings for cell cycle regulation and stress response were more prominent in the intersection of AD and FTD. Protein aggregation, gene regulation, and energetics were more prominent in the intersection of ALS and FTD. Synapse and neurotransmission, membrane regulation, and inflammation and immune response were greater at the intersection of AD and ALS. Given the extensive molecular pathophysiology overlap, small differences in regulation, genetic, or environmental factors likely shape the underlying expressed disease phenotype.

Here, we delve into the potential of harnessing 5-HT as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that the current clinical drugs targeting 5-HT are still limited in the treatment of these complex diseases.

At some level, all of them share a combination of one or more different toxic biomarker proteins: amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated Tau (pTau), alpha-synuclein (αSyn), mutant huntingtin (mHtt), fused in sarcoma, superoxide dismutase 1, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43. These toxic proteins share some common attributes, making them potentially universal and simultaneous targets for therapeutic intervention. First, they all form toxic aggregates prior to taking on their final forms as contributors to plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, and other protein deposits. Second, the primary enzyme that directs their aggregation is transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), a brain-localized enzyme involved in neurodegeneration. Third, TGM2 binds to calmodulin, a regulatory event that can increase the activity of this enzyme threefold. Fourth, the most common mixed pathology toxic biomarkers (Aβ, pTau, αSyn, nHtt) also bind calmodulin, which can affect their ability to aggregate.

Recent advancements in nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer promising solutions, with potential applications in drug delivery, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. By examining current research, we explore how NPs can cross the BBB, deliver medications directly to targeted CNS regions, and enhance both diagnostics and treatment. Key NP strategies, such as passive targeting, receptor-mediated transport, and stimuli-responsive systems, demonstrate encouraging results. Studies show that NPs may improve drug delivery, minimize side effects, and increase therapeutic effectiveness in models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and glioblastoma.

    "AbstractText": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of neurodevelopmental (schizophrenia) and aging-associated (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia) neurodegenerative diseases. Limited efficacy of current pharmacological treatments warrants further search for new targets for nootropic interventions. The breakdown of myelin, a phospholipids axonal sheath that protects the conduction of nerve impulse between neurons, was proposed as a neuropathological abnormality that precedes and promotes the deposition of amyloid-β in neuritic plaques. The present review of the recent literature and our own pre- and clinical data suggest (for the first time) that the anthranilic acid (AA)-induced activation of microglial-expressed G-protein coupled receptor (GPR109A) inhibits cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an enzyme that triggers the degradation of myelin and consequently attenuates cognitive impairment. The present review suggests that the up-regulation of AA formation is a sex-specific compensatory (adaptive) reaction aimed to prevent/treat cognitive impairment. The AA-GPR109A-cPLA2-myelin-cognition cascade suggests new nootropic interventions, e.g., the administration of pegylated kynureninase, an enzyme that catalyzes AA formation from Kynurenine (Kyn), a tryptophane catabolite; pegylated interferon-alpha; central and peripheral Kyn aminotransferase inhibitors that increase availability of Kyn as a substrate for AA formation; and vagus nerve stimulation. The cascade predicts nootropic activity of exogenous GPR109A agonists that were designed and underwent clinical trials (unsuccessful) as anti-dyslipidemia agents. The proposed cascade might contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Data on AA in neurodegenerative disorders are scarce, and the proposed cascade needs further exploration in pre- and clinical studies.",

    "AbstractText": "Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects memory abilities due to genetic and environmental factors. A well-known gene that influences the risk of Alzheimer's disease is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The APOE gene is involved in the production of a protein that helps transport cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. Problems in this process are thought to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. APOE comes in several forms, which are called alleles (ε2, ε3, ε4). Materials and Methods: Therefore, our study aims to identify those subjects with a higher genetic risk through the polymorphism of the APOE gene, using a population screening in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD in a region of Spain, Castilla y León, as potential biomarkers and to identify individuals at increased genetic risk by polymorphism of the APOE gene. An observational case-control study was conducted in Castilla y León (Spain). Saliva samples were collected and the ApoE gene was analyzed by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis, respecting ethical criteria. Results: In the Alzheimer's population in Castilla y León, a high prevalence of ApoE3 (74%) was found, followed by ApoE4 (22%); in addition, a higher presence of the ε4 allele was found in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group than in the control group. It was also observed that the ε2/ε2 genotype was not found in any individual with AD but was found in healthy subjects and that the opposite was observed for the ε4/ε4 genotype. The odds ratio (OR) indicated a risk four times greater of having AD if having the ε4 allele. Conclusions: The demonstrated relation between the different isoforms and the likelihood of developing AD has led to its consideration as a biomarker and a potential pre-symptomatic therapy. The molecular mechanisms that confer a disruptive and protective role to ApoE4 and ApoE2, respectively, are still being studied.",

Methods: Neural network models representing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were randomly assigned to four groups: AD, memantine treatment, DBS, and DBS and memantine. Out of 100 unique neural networks created to model moderate and severe AD with varying hippocampal synaptic loss, 20 were randomly selected to represent AD patients. Virtual treatments-memantine, DBS, and DBS and memantine-were applied, resulting in a total of 80 simulations. Results: The normalized mean number of spikes in the CA1 region among the virtual AD hippocampi treated with memantine, DBS therapy, and DBS and memantine differed significantly (p < 0.0001).

It is expected that the incidence of PD will exceed 12 million by 2040. Meanwhile, there is a recognized difference in the phenotypical expression of the disease and response to treatment between men and women. Men have twice the incidence of PD compared to women, who have a late onset and worse prognosis that is usually associated with menopause. In addition, the incidence of PD in women is associated with the cumulative estrogen levels in their bodies. These differences are suggested to be due to the protective effect of estrogen on the brain, which cannot be given in clinical practice to improve the symptoms of the disease because of its peripheral side effects, causing cancer in both males and females in addition to the feminizing effect it has on males. As PD pathophysiology involves alteration in the expression levels of multiple LncRNAs, including metastatic-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and as estrogen has been illustrated to control the expression of MALAT1 in multiple conditions, it is worth investigating the estrogen-MALAT1 interaction in Parkinson's disease to mimic its protective effect on the brain while avoiding its peripheral side effects.

However, the low spatial resolution of PET scans limits the accurate quantification of amyloid deposition due to partial volume effects (PVE).

We leverage a synthetic data generation pipeline to create high-resolution PET digital phantoms for model training. The proposed LDM-RR model incorporates a weighted combination of L1, L2, and MS-SSIM losses at both noise and image scales to enhance MRI-guided reconstruction. We evaluated the model's performance in improving statistical power for detecting longitudinal changes and enhancing agreement between amyloid PET measurements from different tracers. The results demonstrate that the LDM-RR approach significantly improves PET quantification accuracy, reduces inter-tracer variability, and enhances the detection of subtle changes in amyloid deposition over time.

The onset of the neurodegenerative process is triggered decades before the first symptoms appear, probably due to a combination of genomic and epigenetic phenomena. Therefore, the primary objective of any effective treatment is to intercept the disease process in its presymptomatic phases. Since the approval of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Tacrine, Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine) and Memantine, between 1993 and 2003, no new drug was approved by the FDA until the advent of immunotherapy with Aducanumab in 2021 and Lecanemab in 2023. Over the past decade, more than 10,000 new compounds with potential action on some pathogenic components of AD have been tested. The limitations of these anti-AD treatments have stimulated the search for multi-target (MT) drugs. In recent years, more than 1000 drugs with potential MT function have been studied in AD models. MT drugs aim to address the complex and multifactorial nature of the disease. This approach has the potential to offer more comprehensive benefits than single-target therapies, which may be limited in their effectiveness due to the intricate pathology of AD. A strategy still unexplored is the combination of epigenetic drugs with MT agents.

Intrinsic anatomic and metabolic differences related to male and female physiology have been described, underscoring the importance of considering biological sex in studying brain metabolism and associated pathologies. The hippocampus is a key structure exhibiting sex differences in volume and connectivity. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, dendritic spine density, and electrophysiological plasticity contribute to the hippocampus' remarkable plasticity. Glucose transporters GLUT3 and GLUT4 are expressed in human hippocampal neurons, with proper glucose metabolism being crucial for learning and memory. Sex hormones play a major role, with the aromatase enzyme that generates estradiol increasing in neurons and astrocytes as an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism. Inhibition of aromatase increases gliosis and neurodegeneration after brain injury. Genetic variants of aromatase may confer higher Alzheimer's risk. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women prevents hippocampal hypometabolism and preserves memory. Insulin is also a key regulator of hippocampal glucose metabolism and cognitive processes. Dysregulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 may explain the comorbidity between type II diabetes and Alzheimer's. GLUT4 colocalizes with the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase IRAP in neuronal vesicles, suggesting an activity-dependent glucose uptake mechanism.

    "AbstractText": "The plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease are formed as a result of the aggregation of Aβ peptides, which vary in length from 38 to 43 amino acids. The 1-40 peptide is the most abundant, while the 1-42 peptide appears to be the most destructive to neurons and/or glial cells in a variety of assays. We have demonstrated that aggregated Aβ, a state prior to plaque formation, will activate the plasma bradykinin-forming pathway when tested in vitro. Aggregation is zinc-dependent, optimal at 25-50 µM, and the rate of aggregation is paralleled by the rate of activation of the bradykinin-forming pathway as assessed by plasma kallikrein formation. The aggregation of Aβ 1-38, 1-40, and 1-42 is optimal after incubation for 3 days, 3 h, and under 1 min, respectively. The cascade is initiated by the autoactivation of factor XII upon binding to aggregated Aβ; then, prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein, which cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Studies by a variety of other researchers have demonstrated the presence of each \"activation-step\" in either the plasma or spinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease, including activated factor XII, kallikrein, and bradykinin itself. There is also evidence that activation is more prominent as dementia worsens. We now have medications that can block each step of the bradykinin-forming pathway as currently employed for the therapy of hereditary angioedema. Given the current state of therapy for Alzheimer's disease, which includes monoclonal antibodies that retard the rate of progression by 30% at most and have significant side effects, it seems imperative to explore prophylaxis using one of the long-acting agents that target plasma kallikrein or factor XIIa.

Twenty one of these patients fulfilled the criteria for mixed AD (mixed with Lewy bodies, cerebrovascular disease, or normal pressure hydrocephalus), whilst 40 had pure AD. Results: Patients did not differ with respect to gender, education, disease duration, and cognitive status. After controlling for confounding factors, no difference was observed between mixed and pure AD groups in Aβ42 or Aβ42/Aβ40 levels. Although by definition, patients of both groups had abnormal (increased) levels of phospho-tau181, the mixed AD group presented with lower (less abnormal) levels of phospho-tau181 and total tau as compared to the pure group. Conclusions: In patients with AD of comparable cognitive status, mixed AD cases may present with lower levels of tau proteins and, if close to the cut-off values, diagnostic uncertainty may be increased.",

    "AbstractText": "Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by amyloid-β plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), leading to cognitive decline and debilitating non-cognitive symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate compounds from four different classes in a short-term (7-day) study using transgenic tau mice to assess their ability to reduce non-cognitive symptoms. The best candidate was then evaluated for longer exposure to assess non-cognitive symptoms, cognition, and pathology. Methods: Tg4510 mice, expressing mutated human tau (P301L), were administered with levetiracetam, methylphenidate, diazepam, and quetiapine for 7 days at 6 months old, when pathology and cognitive deficits are established. Drugs were given in the diet, and non-cognitive symptoms were evaluated using metabolic cages. Levetiracetam was chosen for longer exposure (3 months) in 3-month-old Tg4510 mice and non-transgenic controls to assess behavior and pathology. Results: After 3 months of diet, levetiracetam mildly reduced tau pathology in the hippocampus but did not improve cognition in Tg4510 mice. Interestingly, it influenced appetite, body weight, anxiety-like behavior, and contextual fear memory in non-transgenic animals but not in Tg4510 mice. Conclusions: While levetiracetam has shown benefits in amyloid deposition models, it had limited effects on tau pathology and behavior in an animal model of tau deposition, which is crucial for AD context. The differential effects on non-transgenic versus Tg4510 mice warrant further investigation.",

    "AbstractText": "(1) Background: Impeded resolution of inflammation contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); consequently, resolving inflammation is pivotal to the amelioration of AD pathology. This can potentially be achieved by the treatment with specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), which should resolve neuroinflammation in brains. (2) Methods: Here, we report the histological effects of long-term treatment with an SPM, maresin-like 1 (MarL1), on AD pathogenesis in a transgenic 5xFAD mouse model. (3) Results: MarL1 treatment reduced Aβ overload, curbed the loss of neurons in brains especially cholinergic neurons associated with cleaved-caspase-3-associated apoptotic degeneration, reduced microgliosis and the pro-inflammatory M1 polarization of microglia, curbed the AD-associated decline in anti-inflammatory Iba1+Arg-1+-M2 microglia, inhibited phenotypic switching to pro-inflammatory N1 neutrophils, promoted the blood-brain barrier-associated tight-junction protein claudin-5 and decreased neutrophil leakage in 5xFAD brains, and induced the switch of neutrophils toward the inflammation-resolving N2 phenotype. (4) Conclusions: Long-term administration of MarL1 mitigates AD-related neuropathogenesis in brains by curbing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, based on the histological results. These findings provide preclinical leads and mechanistic insights for the development of MarL1 into an effective modality to ameliorate AD pathogenesis.",

There is an urgent need to develop reliable and sensitive biomarkers to aid the timely diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and therapeutic development for neurodegenerative disorders. Proteomic screening strategies, including antibody microarrays, are a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, but their findings should be confirmed using quantitative assays. The current study explored the feasibility of combining an exploratory proteomic strategy and confirmatory ligand-binding assays to screen for and validate biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. METHODS: It analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis and healthy controls using an exploratory antibody microarray and validatory ligand-binding assays. RESULTS: The screening antibody microarray identified differentially expressed proteins between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls, including cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), osteopontin, and vascular endothelial growth factor 165b. Quantitative ligand-binding assays confirmed that CD14 levels were elevated in CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (p = 0.0177), whereas osteopontin levels were increased in CSF of patients with Parkinson's disease (p = 0.0346). CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated the potential utility of combining an exploratory proteomic approach and quantitative ligand-binding assays to identify biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. To further validate and expand these findings, large-scale analyses using well-characterized samples should be conducted.",

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the renal proximal tubule, plays a role in urine glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have shown potential benefits beyond cardiac and renal improvement in preventing and treating cognitive impairment (CI), including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in T2DM patients. Studies suggest that SGLT2i may ameliorate diabetic CI through metabolism pathways, inflammation, oxidative stress, neurotrophic factors and AChE inhibition. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have reported significant and insignificant results. Given their vascular effects, SGLT2i may offer unique protection against vascular CI. This review compiles mechanisms and clinical evidence, emphasizing the need for future analysis, evaluation, trials and meta-analyses to verify and recommend optimal SGLT2i selection and dosage for specific patients.",

    "AbstractText": "The coexistence of dementia and depression in older populations presents a complex clinical challenge, with each condition often exacerbating the other. Cognitive decline can intensify mood disturbances, and untreated or recurring depression accelerates neurodegenerative processes. As depression is a recognized risk factor for dementia, it is crucial to address both conditions concurrently to prevent further deterioration. Antidepressants are frequently used to manage depression in dementia patients, with some studies suggesting they offer neuroprotective benefits. These benefits include promoting neurogenesis, enhancing synaptic plasticity, and reducing neuroinflammation, potentially slowing cognitive decline. Additionally, antidepressants have shown promise in addressing Alzheimer's-related pathologies by reducing amyloid-beta accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation. However, treatment-resistant depression remains a significant challenge, particularly in older adults with cognitive impairment. Many do not respond well to standard antidepressant therapies due to advanced neurodegenerative changes. Conflicting findings from studies add to the uncertainty, with some research suggesting that antidepressants may increase dementia risk, especially when used in patients with undiagnosed early-stage dementia. This article aims to explore the intricate relationship between depression and dementia, examining the benefits and risks of antidepressant use. We highlight the urgent need for personalized, comprehensive treatment strategies that balance mental health improvement with cognitive protection.",

TBI pathology involves complex secondary injury cascades that are associated with cellular and molecular dysfunction, including oxidative stress, coagulopathy, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, neurotoxicity, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, among others. These pathological processes manifest as a diverse array of clinical impairments. They serve as targets for potential therapeutic intervention not only in TBI but also in other diseases. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used as key therapeutic agents targeting these mechanisms for the treatment of diverse diseases, including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). MAb therapies provide a tool to block disease pathways with target specificity that may be capable of mitigating the secondary injury cascades following TBI. This article reviews the pathophysiology of TBI and the molecular mechanisms of action of mAbs that target these shared pathological pathways in a wide range of diseases. Publicly available databases for various applications of mAb therapy were searched and further classified to assess relevance to TBI pathology and evaluate current stages of development.

This study investigates the effects of semaglutide (SEM), a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, on cognitive function and anxiety-like behavior in a transgenic murine model of AD. METHODS: 20 mice were randomly distributed into the following groups (n = 5): (WT + VEH) group: C57BL/6J + saline, (WT + SEM) group: C57BL/6J + semaglutide, (AD + VEH) group: AD + saline, (AD + SEM) group: AD + semaglutide. The animals underwent a four-week treatment, during which we monitored blood glucose levels, body weight, and responses in an open field test, novel object recognition test, social chamber test, and 0-maze test. RESULTS: Post-treatment, SEM significantly reduced blood glucose levels in AD mice, aligning them with those of wild-type controls. Cognitive assessments indicated an improvement in the investigation index for SEM-treated mice compared to those receiving a vehicle, suggesting cognitive benefits. Although SEM did not significantly enhance motor and exploratory activities, it displayed a potential anxiolytic effect, particularly evident in the combined anxiety index, with notable differences observed before and after treatment in the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study suggest that SEM may play a dual role in managing AD by improving glycemic control and potentially enhancing cognitive function. As the landscape of AD treatment evolves, the comprehensive approach of utilizing SEM could pave the way for innovative interventions targeting the complex interplay of metabolic and cognitive dysfunctions in this challenging neurodegenerative disorder.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention-deficit disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease (PD), polycystic ovary disease (PCOS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have all been linked to exposure to bisphenol A (BPA). METHODS: This paper is a review and discussion of the published literature. RESULTS: Animal studies have shown BPA to be a broad-spectrum endocrine disruptor. BPA is metabolized via the glucuronidation pathway, which involves the addition of glucose to the target molecule, and is catalyzed by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). Evidence of compromised glucuronidation has been found for ASD, DHD, PD, and PCOS. Genetic polymorphisms that alter the catalytic activity of the UGTs and efflux transporters involved are common. There are two ways to interpret the findings of associations between BPA glucuronidation efficiency and disease, a 'direct' pathway and an 'indirect' pathway. With the 'direct' pathway, free BPA is the actual causative agent. Compromised BPA detoxification leads to higher concentrations of free BPA in vulnerable tissues. Decreased BPA detoxification leads to increased exposure of vulnerable tissues to free BPA, where it can function as an endocrine disruptor. With the 'indirect' pathway, BPA is not the causative agent. BPA serves as a marker for the decreased glucuronidation efficiency of another unknown compound of endogenous origin detoxified by a similar combination of UGTs and efflux transporters as BPA. It is this compound(s), acting as an endocrine disruptor, that leads to a metabolic environment that favors disease development over an extended time period. CONCLUSION: A review of the existing literature supports the indirect 'marker' hypothesis over the 'direct' hypothesis.",

    "AbstractText": "Microbiota-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a crucial role in modulating the gut-brain axis, with significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. H2S is produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the gut and acts as a critical signaling molecule influencing brain health via various pathways, including regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune responses. H2S maintains gut barrier integrity at physiological levels and prevents systemic inflammation, which could impact neuroinflammation. However, as H2S has a dual role or a Janus face, excessive H2S production, often resulting from gut dysbiosis, can compromise the intestinal barrier and exacerbate neurodegenerative processes by promoting neuroinflammation and glial cell dysfunction. This imbalance is linked to the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where the overproduction of H2S exacerbates beta-amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, driving neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal damage. Targeting gut microbiota to restore H2S homeostasis through dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation presents a promising therapeutic approach. By rebalancing the microbiota-derived H2S, these strategies may mitigate neurodegeneration and offer novel treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, underscoring the critical role of the gut-brain axis in maintaining central nervous system health.",

The impact of these changes has been particularly severe in older subjects with cognitive impairment. METHODS: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of lockdown on Alzheimer's disease patients (in cognition, behavior, and autonomy) and on their caregivers (in emotions, burden, and quality of life). We created a questionnaire and performed an extensive semi-structured telephone interview with each caregiver. The main outcomes were (1) changes in cognitive and behavioral symptoms and autonomy levels in the patients and (2) effects on caregivers' emotions, burden, and quality of life. RESULTS: The lockdown severely impaired patients' cognition and independence and worsened behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. These effects contributed to increasing caregivers' burden and stress levels, with a significant perceived deterioration in quality of life among caregivers with higher education levels (p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: This study might contribute to our understanding of the impact of lockdown on Alzheimer's disease patients and their caregivers, to guide future public health interventions aimed at preventing and/or reducing the consequences of similar extraordinary events in frail subjects.",

Notwithstanding progress, conventional diagnostic techniques continue to be susceptible to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential for early intervention. METHODS: We present an enhanced hybrid deep learning framework that amalgamates the EfficientNetV2B3 with Inception-ResNetV2 models. The models were integrated using an adaptive weight selection process informed by the Cuckoo Search optimization algorithm. The procedure commences with the pre-processing of neuroimaging data to guarantee quality and uniformity. Features are subsequently retrieved from the neuroimaging data by utilizing the EfficientNetV2B3 and Inception-ResNetV2 models. The Cuckoo Search algorithm allocates weights to various models dynamically, contingent upon their efficacy in particular diagnostic tasks. The framework achieves balanced usage of the distinct characteristics of both models through the iterative optimization of the weight configuration. This method improves classification accuracy, especially for early-stage Alzheimer's disease. A thorough assessment was conducted on extensive neuroimaging datasets to verify the framework's efficacy. RESULTS: The framework attained a Scott's Pi agreement score of 0.9907, indicating exceptional diagnostic accuracy and dependability, especially in identifying the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. The results show its superiority over current state-of-the-art techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the substantial potential of the proposed framework as a reliable and scalable instrument for the identification of Alzheimer's disease. This method effectively mitigates the shortcomings of conventional diagnostic techniques and current deep learning algorithms by utilizing the complementing capabilities of EfficientNetV2B3 and Inception-ResNetV2 by using an optimized weight selection mechanism. The adaptive characteristics of the Cuckoo Search optimization facilitate its application across many diagnostic circumstances, hence extending its utility to a wider array of neuroimaging datasets. The capacity to accurately identify early-stage Alzheimer's disease is essential for facilitating prompt therapies, which are crucial for decelerating disease development and enhancing patient outcomes.",

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is critical for better management and treatment outcomes, but it remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of the disease. Clinical data, including a range of cognitive, functional, and demographic variables, play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease classification. Also, challenges such as data imbalance and high-dimensional feature sets often hinder model performance. Objective: This paper aims to propose a computationally efficient, reliable, and transparent machine learning-based framework for the classification of Alzheimer's disease patients. This framework is interpretable and helps medical practitioners learn complex patterns in patients.

To mitigate data imbalance, a random sampling technique is applied, ensuring a balanced representation of Alzheimer's and healthy cases. Extensive feature analysis was conducted to identify the most impactful clinical features followed by feature reduction techniques to focus on the most informative clinical features, reducing model complexity and overfitting risks. Explainable AI tools, such as SHAP, LIME, ALE, and ELI5 are integrated to provide transparency into the model's decision-making process, highlighting key features influencing the classification and allowing clinicians to understand and trust the key features driving the predictions. Results: This approach results in a robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. The proposed approach achieved the best accuracy of 95%, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for reliable early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

These pathological aggregates interfere with neuronal function, leading to the disruption of cognitive processes, particularly memory. The deposition of Aβ forms senile plaques, while tau protein, in its hyperphosphorylated state, forms neurofibrillary tangles, both of which contribute to the underlying neurodegeneration observed in AD. Rosmarinic acid (RosA), a natural compound found in plants such as Rosmarinus officinalis, is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, RosA holds promise as a nutritional supplement that may support brain health. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the impact of RosA on the structural stability of Aβ peptides. The results indicated that the addition of RosA increased the instability of Aβ, as evidenced by an increase in the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), a decrease in the Radius of Gyration (Rg), and an expansion of the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA). This destabilization is primarily attributed to the disruption of native hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the presence of two RosA molecules. The free energy landscape (FEL) analysis and MM-PBSA (Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area Mechanics) results further support the notion that RosA can effectively bind to the hydrophobic pocket of the protein, highlighting its potential as a nutritional component that may contribute to maintaining brain health and function.",

The exact relationship between the two diseases is uncertain, though epidemiological studies have demonstrated that CVDs appear to increase the risk of AD and vice versa. This scoping review aims to examine the current identified overlapping genetics between CVDs and AD at the individual gene level and at the shared pathway level. METHODS: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines for a scoping review, we searched the PubMed and Scopus databases from 1990 to October 2024 for articles that involved (1) CVDs, (2) AD, and (3) used statistical methods to parse genetic relationships. RESULTS: Our search yielded 2918 articles, of which 274 articles passed screening and were organized into two main sections: (1) evidence of shared genetic risk; and (2) shared mechanisms. The genes APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2 reportedly have wide effects across the AD and CVD spectrum, affecting both cardiac and brain tissues. Mechanistically, changes in three main pathways (lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)) contribute to subclinical and etiological changes that promote both AD and CVD progression. However, genetic studies continue to be limited by the availability of longitudinal data and lack of cohorts that are representative of diverse populations. CONCLUSIONS: Highly penetrant familial genes simultaneously increase the risk of CVDs and AD.

In mental imagery (MI) technique, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of MI on the quality of life, cognitive, and emotional status of older adults with an early stage of dementia. METHODS: The present randomized controlled trial consisted of 160 participants. The sample from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association was randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (intervention group, n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group, n = 52), and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group, n = 53). Participants engaged in a total of 24 physiotherapy sessions, each lasting approximately 45 min, scheduled twice weekly over a 12-week period. They performed three assessments: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) one and a half months, and (c) after the program. The intervention group performed a 30 min MI with exercise program content immediately following every physiotherapy exercise session. Walking While Talking Test (WWITT), the Euro-Qol 5-Dimensions 5-Level of severity scale (Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale), the Short-Form of Geriatric Depression Scale (SF-GDS), and the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST) were used to assess cognitive status, emotional status, and quality of life.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Those with the genetic disorder Down syndrome are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Previous work shows group differences in magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite measures in adults with Down syndrome who have Alzheimer's disease-related dementia compared to those who do not. In this pilot study, we assess relationships between metabolites and measures related to dementia status in a sample of adults with Down syndrome. METHODS: Seventeen adults with Down syndrome were scanned using a 3 tesla MRI scanner. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans focused on the hippocampus and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Metabolites of interest, including myo-inositol and N-acetyl-aspartate, were correlated with scores on the Dementia Questionnaire for People with Learning Disabilities, cortical thickness, and a measure of cognitive ability. In addition, cortical thickness was compared to an age- and sex-matched cohort of 17 previously scanned adults without Down syndrome. RESULTS: Metabolite measures were not significantly related to cognitive/behavioral measures or to cortical thickness in this small cohort. Participants with Down syndrome showed widespread increases in cortical thickness compared to controls, even after accounting for potential differences in grey matter/white matter contrast. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolite values were not related to two continuous measures that have previously been associated with dementia status in those with Down syndrome.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Clearing Amyloid-Beta by Astrocytes: The Role of Rho GTPases Signaling Pathways as Potential Therapeutic Targets.",
    "AbstractText": "Astrocytes, vital support cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are crucial for maintaining neuronal health. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), astrocytes play a key role in clearing toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Aβ, a potent neuroinflammatory trigger, stimulates astrocytes to release excessive glutamate and inflammatory factors, exacerbating neuronal dysfunction and death. Recent studies underscore the role of Rho GTPases-particularly RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42-in regulating Aβ clearance and neuroinflammation. These key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling pathways function independently through distinct mechanisms but may converge to modulate inflammatory responses. Their influence on astrocyte structure and function extends to regulating endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity, which modulates vasoactive peptides such as endothelin-1 (ET-1). Through these processes, Rho GTPases impact vascular permeability and neuroinflammation, contributing to AD pathogenesis by affecting both Aβ clearance and cerebrovascular interactions. Understanding the interplay between Rho GTPases and the cerebrovascular system provides fresh insights into AD pathogenesis. Targeting Rho GTPase signaling pathways in astrocytes could offer a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate neuroinflammation, enhance Aβ clearance, and slow disease progression, ultimately improving cognitive outcomes in AD patients.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Visual processing deficits arising in dementia are associated with particular functional disability. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mobility and navigation in people with dementia-related visual loss. METHODS: Participants with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; \"visual-variant Alzheimer's\"; n = 11), typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD; N = 10), and controls (n = 13) repeatedly walked down routes within a simplified real-world setting. Participant groups were of comparable age and gender. Routes were of different complexity (straight, U-shaped, and S-shaped), overhead lighting levels (low and high) and with or without a dynamic LED (light-emitting diode) cue (trial n = 24). Ratios of walking times for each experimental condition (each complex route vs the straight route, high lighting vs low, and LED cue vs no cue) were compared between participant groups. Kinematic measures were produced from a total of 10,813 steps using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). RESULTS: The walking time ratios relating to route complexity were higher in the PCA group than in controls: 30.3% (95% CI [13.5%, 49.5%] higher for U-shaped vs straight and 31.9% [21.1%, 55.3%] for S-shaped vs straight, averaged over other conditions). The analogous results relating to route complexity for the tAD group were intermediate between those for the PCA and control groups. There was no evidence that walking time ratios differed according to lighting level or the presence of the LED cue. CONCLUSIONS: Findings contribute to evidence-based design for dementia-friendly environments, emphasizing consequences of environmental complexity for functional independence and mobility in people with dementia-related visual loss. Findings inform recommendations for environmental design to support the independence of individuals with dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diabetes mellitus (DM), a widespread endocrine disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, can cause nerve damage and increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Effective blood glucose management is essential, and sitagliptin (SITG), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, may offer neuroprotective benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: T2DM was induced in rats using nicotinamide (NICO) and streptozotocin (STZ), and biomarkers of AD and DM-linked enzymes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were evaluated in the brain. Computational studies supported the in vivo findings. RESULTS: SITG significantly reduced the brain enzyme levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1), DPP-4, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in T2DM-induced rats. It also reduced inflammation by lowering cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Additionally, SITG improved oxidative stress markers by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhancing glutathione (GSH). It increased anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) while reducing pro-apoptotic markers such as Bcl-2-associated X (BAX) and Caspace-3. SITG also lowered blood glucose levels and improved plasma insulin levels. To explore potential molecular level mechanisms, docking was performed on AChE, COX-2, GSK-3β, BACE-1, and Caspace-3. The potential binding affinity of SITG for the above-mentioned target enzymes were 10.8, 8.0, 9.7, 7.7, and 7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, comparable to co-crystallized ligands. Further binding mode analysis of the lowest energy conformation revealed interactions with the critical residues. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight SITG's neuroprotective molecular targets in T2DM-associated neurodegeneration and its potential as a therapeutic approach for AD, warranting further clinical investigations.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: There is currently increasing interest in the implication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a potential risk factor for long-term neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between TBI and the risk of dementia. METHODS: A systematic search was performed across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, to identify relevant meta-analyses and cohort studies. Studies were included if they reported effect sizes (odds ratios [ORs] or relative risks [RRs]) for the association between TBI, its severity, and the risk of dementia or AD. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of six studies were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed that TBI significantly increases the risk of dementia, with an overall odds ratio of 1.81 (95% CI: 1.53-2.14). Mild TBI was associated with a modest increase in dementia risk (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.70-2.26), while moderate-to-severe TBI showed a stronger association (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.55-2.45). In contrast, the association between TBI and AD was less consistent, with the pooled OR for AD being 1.18 (at 95% CI: 1.11-1.25) for mild TBI; however, in several studies, no significant association was observed (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.91-1.15). The results also indicated substantial heterogeneity across studies, particularly in relation to AD outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this umbrella meta-analysis confirm that TBI is a significant risk factor for dementia, with more severe TBIs conferring a higher risk. While mild TBIs also increase the risk of dementia, the effect is more pronounced in moderate-to-severe injuries. The evidence linking TBI to AD is less robust, with inconsistent findings across studies. Clinicians should consider long-term cognitive screening and management for individuals with a history of TBI, particularly those with moderate-to-severe injuries.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The biological basis for behavioral manifestations of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. Emotional and behavioral alterations of Alzheimer's disease can result in substantial caregiver burden and lack effective management. This study expands upon previous work investigating behavioral alterations in mice with Alzheimer's disease and a potential treatment of increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). METHODS: A total of 47 3xTg-AD (Alzheimer's) and 53 B6 (wildtype) mice were administered ANA12 (an antagonist of TrkB receptor) or Vehicle (saline) and then rTMS or Sham treatment daily. After 14 days of treatments and injections, mouse behavior was assessed under various behavioral cognitive tests. Mice were then perfused, and brain samples were processed for histology and protein assays. Brain homogenates were analyzed for BDNF and its downstream signaling molecules. RESULTS: Open field testing demonstrated that 3xTg-AD mice spent more time in the center than B6 mice. 3xTg-AD-Sham mice injected with ANA12 were the only group to travel significantly less distance than B6-ANA12-Sham or B6-Vehicle-Sham mice (p < 0.05), while 3xTg-AD-rTMS mice (irrespective of injection) were not significantly different from B6 mice. 3xTg-AD mice had significantly greater measured levels of BDNF and TrkB than the wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Alzheimer's disease using rTMS positively affects elements of hypoactivity, but not all behavioral abnormalities. rTMS shifted 3xTg-AD open field behavioral test measures, generating significant differences between untreated 3xTg-AD and B6 genotypes. Despite its benefit, further investigation of rTMS as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease as well as its biological underpinnings are needed.",

    "AbstractText": "We previously reported that membrane-type 5-matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP) deficiency not only reduces pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 5xFAD (Tg) mice in vivo but also impairs interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)-mediated neuroinflammation and Aβ production in primary Tg immature neural cell cultures after 11 days in vitro. We now investigate the effect of MT5-MMP on incipient pathogenic pathways that are activated in cortical primary cultures at 21-24 days in vitro (DIV), during which time neurons are organized into a functional mature network. Using wild-type (WT), MT5-MMP-/- (MT5-/-), 5xFAD (Tg), and 5xFADxMT5-MMP-/- (TgMT5-/-) mice, we generated primary neuronal cultures that were exposed to IL-1β and/or different proteolytic system inhibitors. We assessed neuroinflammation, APP metabolism, synaptic integrity, and electrophysiological properties using biochemical, imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp approaches. The absence of MT5-MMP impaired the IL-1β-mediated induction of inflammatory genes in TgMT5-/- cells compared to Tg cells. Furthermore, the reduced density of dendritic spines in Tg neurons was also prevented in TgMT5-/- neurons. IL-1β caused a strong decrease in the dendritic spine density of WT neurons, which was prevented in MT5-/- neurons. However, the latter exhibited fewer spines than the WT under untreated conditions. The spontaneous rhythmic firing frequency of the network was increased in MT5-/- neurons, but not in TgMT5-/- neurons, and IL-1β increased this parameter only in Tg neurons. In terms of induced somatic excitability, Tg and TgMT5-/- neurons exhibited lower excitability than WT and MT5-/-, while IL-1β impaired excitability only in non-AD backgrounds. The synaptic strength of miniature global synaptic currents was equivalent in all genotypes but increased dramatically in WT and MT5-/- neurons after IL-1β. MT5-MMP deficiency decreased endogenous and overexpressed C83 and C99 levels but did not affect Aβ levels. C99 appears to be cleared by several pathways, including γ-secretase, the autophagolysosomal system, and also α-secretase, via its conversion to C83. In summary, this study confirms that MT5-MMP is a pivotal factor affecting not only neuroinflammation and APP metabolism but also synaptogenesis and synaptic activity at early stages of the pathology, and reinforces the relevance of targeting MT5-MMP to fight AD.",

It is characterized by cognitive impairment and dementia due to abnormal levels of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and axonal Tau protein in the brain. However, the complex underlying mechanisms affecting this disease are not yet known, and there is a lack of standardized biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Therefore, in this study, by means of bioinformatics analysis, AD-affected brain tissue was analyzed using the GSE138260 dataset, identifying 612 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional analysis revealed 388 upregulated DEGs associated with sensory perception and 224 downregulated DEGs linked to the regulation and modulation of synaptic processes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified 20 hub genes.

    "AbstractText": "Alcohol consumption is believed to affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the contributing mechanisms are not well understood. A potential mediator of the proposed alcohol-AD connection is autophagy, a degradation pathway that maintains organelle and protein homeostasis. Autophagy is regulated through the activity of Transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes lysosome and autophagy-related gene expression. The purpose of this study is to explore whether chronic alcohol consumption worsens the age-related decline in TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis in the brain and exacerbates cognitive decline associated with aging. To explore the effect of alcohol on brain TFEB and autophagy, we exposed young (3-month-old) and aged (23-month-old) mice to two alcohol-feeding paradigms and assessed biochemical, transcriptome, histology, and behavioral endpoints. In young mice, alcohol decreased hippocampal nuclear TFEB staining but increased SQSTM1/p62, LC3-II, ubiquitinated proteins, and phosphorylated Tau. Hippocampal TFEB activity was lower in aged mice than it was in young mice, and Gao-binge alcohol feeding did not worsen the age-related reduction in TFEB activity. Morris Water and Barnes Maze spatial memory tasks were used to characterize the effects of aging and chronic alcohol exposure (mice fed alcohol for 4 weeks). The aged mice showed worse spatial memory acquisition in both tests. Alcohol feeding slightly impaired spatial memory in the young mice, but had little effect or even slightly improved spatial memory acquisition in the aged mice. In conclusion, aging produces greater reductions in brain autophagy flux and impairment of spatial memory than alcohol consumption.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Multifaceted Role of Specialized Neuropeptide-Intensive Neurons on the Selective Vulnerability to Alzheimer's Disease in the Human Brain.",
    "AbstractText": "Regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific neuronal populations and brain regions exhibit selective vulnerability. Understanding the basis of this selective neuronal and regional vulnerability is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology. However, progress in this area is currently hindered by the incomplete understanding of the intricate functional and spatial diversity of neuronal subtypes in the human brain. Previous studies have demonstrated that neuronal subpopulations with high neuropeptide (NP) co-expression are disproportionately absent in the entorhinal cortex of AD brains at the single-cell level, and there is a significant decline in hippocampal NP expression in naturally aging human brains. Given the role of NPs in neuroprotection and the maintenance of microenvironments, we hypothesize that neurons expressing higher levels of NPs (HNP neurons) possess unique functional characteristics that predispose them to cellular abnormalities, which can manifest as degeneration in AD with aging. To test this hypothesis, multiscale and spatiotemporal transcriptome data from ~1900 human brain samples were analyzed using publicly available datasets. The results indicate that HNP neurons experienced greater metabolic burden and were more prone to protein misfolding. The observed decrease in neuronal abundance during stages associated with a higher risk of AD, coupled with the age-related decline in the expression of AD-associated neuropeptides (ADNPs), provides temporal evidence supporting the role of NPs in the progression of AD. Additionally, the localization of ADNP-producing HNP neurons in AD-associated brain regions provides neuroanatomical support for the concept that cellular/neuronal composition is a key factor in regional AD vulnerability. This study offers novel insights into the molecular and cellular basis of selective neuronal and regional vulnerability to AD in human brains.",

Each compound demonstrated metal-chelating properties, particularly in sequestering copper ions, with quantitative analysis revealing approximately 40% chelating activity across all the compounds. In cellular models, these hybrid compounds exhibited strong antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, countering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the Aβ(25-35) peptide and its oxidative byproduct, hydrogen peroxide, as demonstrated by quantitative analysis showing on average a 25% increase in cell viability and a reduction in ROS levels to basal states. Further analysis using thioflavin T fluorescence assays, circular dichroism, and computational studies indicated that the synthesized derivatives effectively promoted the self-disaggregation of the Aβ(25-35) fragment. Taken together, these findings suggest a unique profile of neuroprotective actions for indole-phenolic derivatives, combining chelating, antioxidant, and anti-aggregation properties, which position them as promising compounds for the development of multifunctional agents in Alzheimer's disease therapy.

Despite decades of research efforts, there is still no effective cure for this debilitating condition. AD research has increasingly focused on transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) as a potential therapeutic target. NRF2 plays a crucial role in protecting cells and tissues from environmental stressors, such as electrophiles and reactive oxygen species.

In Alzheimer's disease, this inflammatory milieu exacerbates both amyloid and tau pathology. A similar abnormal inflammatory response has been reported in Parkinson's disease, with elevated levels of cytokines and other inflammatory intermediates derived from activated glial cells, which promote the progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Understanding the causes that support this aberrant inflammatory response has become a topic of growing interest and research in neurodegeneration, with high translational potential. It has been postulated that the phenotypic shift of immune cells towards a proinflammatory state combined with the presence of immunogenic cell death fuels a vicious cycle in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. Mitochondria and mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species are downstream effectors of different inflammatory signaling pathways, including inflammasomes. Dysfunctional mitochondria are also recognized as important producers of damage-associated molecular patterns, which can amplify the immune response.

HMTs, such as PRC2 and SETD2, are involved in the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 and lysine 36, influencing gene silencing and activation. Dysregulation of these enzymes often leads to abnormal gene expression and contributes to tumorigenesis. In contrast, HDMs including KDM7A and KDM2A reverse these methylation marks, and their dysfunction can drive disease progression. In cancer, the aberrant activity of specific HMTs and HDMs can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of oncogenes, facilitating tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Conversely, in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), disruptions in histone methylation dynamics are associated with neuronal loss, altered gene expression, and disease progression. We aimed to comprehend the odd activity of HMTs and HDMs and how they contribute to disease pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets.

In Canada and elsewhere, family members commonly see loved ones living with dementia experience difficult moments, including anxiety, stress, and fear. Struggling health care systems strive to apply the latest evidence-based interventions. In this case report, we explore how individuals who care for people with dementia can help redirect difficult personal and interpersonal moments towards hopeful moments in the presence of therapy dogs. The cases of four individuals diagnosed with dementia and interacting with therapy dog intervention in one of three environments-at a family home, in a hospital awaiting placement to a long-term care facility, and in a psychiatric centre-are reviewed from the perspectives of two attending therapy dog handlers. In addition to being researchers in the therapy dog field and authors on this case report, both handlers were guided in a 110 min focused conversational method by a third author, from which self-affirmation theory surfaced as a guiding framework for explaining their observations and experiences. Therapy dog visiting appears to facilitate positive social interactions that can help redirect difficult moments to moments defined by self-affirmation or experiencing a positive sense of self. This is an under-recognized association in the dementia literature. Self-affirmation is demonstrated through four themes during therapy dog visits: (a) physical movement, (b) psychological shift, (c) a transition in the experience of time, and (d) connective interactions. Therapy dogs are identified here as a promising self-affirming psychosocial intervention for individuals with dementia and their caregivers worthy of further research and practice attention.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Treatment with soybean lecithin-derived α-GPC (SHCog™) improves scopolamine-induced cognitive declines in mice via regulating cholinergic neurotransmission and enhancing neural plasticity in the hippocampus.",
    "AbstractText": "Mild cognitive impairment is a diagnostic category marked by declines in memory and cognitive function that are less severe than those observed in Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have indicated that individuals with mild cognitive impairment have an elevated risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease. The hippocampus is well known to play pivotal roles in memory and cognitive functions. Scopolamine (Sco) disrupts cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and triggers functional declines in memory and cognition. SHCog™ is a commercially available alpha glycerophosphorylcholine (α-GPC) derived from soybean lecithin. The objective of the present study was to examine whether SHCog™ can alleviate memory and cognitive dysfunctions in a mouse model of cognitive impairments induced by Sco. In this study, C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to the passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests to investigate short-term and spatial memory functions, respectively. This study also examined cellular morphology and distribution by cresyl violet staining and investigated changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as cholinergic enzymes through immunohistochemical staining of the hippocampus. Additionally, we examined changes in postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) related to neural plasticity in the hippocampus. Treatment with SHCog™ (125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg) brought functional recovery in short-term and spatial memory against Sco-induced memory and cognitive impairments. Changes in cellular morphology and distribution in the hippocampus were not detected following the administration of Sco and/or SHCog™. Treatment with SHCog™ reduced AChE elevated by Sco, whereas SHCog™ administration increased ChAT decreased by Sco. Furthermore, SHCog™ restored PSD-95 and BDNF in the mouse hippocampus reduced by Sco. Specifically, SHCog™ modulated cholinergic neurotransmission and enhanced neural plasticity in the hippocampus. Taken together, we suggest that SHCog™ can be a valuable ingredient in functional foods or supplements for improving memory and cognitive functions.",

    "AbstractText": "Neprilysin (NEP), a zinc-dependent membrane-bound metallopeptidase, regulates various bioactive peptides, particularly in kidneys, vascular endothelium, and the central nervous system. NEP's involvement in metabolizing natriuretic peptides, insulin, and enkephalins makes it a promising target for treating cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases. Several NEP inhibitors, such as sacubitril and omapatrilat, have been approved for clinical use, which inhibit NEP activity to prolong the bioactivity of beneficial peptides, thereby exerting therapeutic effects. However, despite the broad clinical application prospects of NEP inhibitors, they still have specific adverse reactions and side effects, such as hypotension, renal impairment, and a potentially increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. This manuscript comprehensively reviews the progress on single-target and dual-target NEP inhibitors. Dual-target inhibitors often combine with other therapeutic targets, such as angiotensin receptors, to enhance therapeutic effects and reduce adverse reactions. The article also emphasizes these inhibitors' design strategies, structure-activity relationships (SAR), safety, and clinical performance.",

    "AbstractText": "Brain aging is a chronic process linked to inflammation, microglial activation, and oxidative damage, which can ultimately lead to neuronal loss. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-11 (SIGLEC-11) is a human lineage-specific microglial cell surface receptor that recognizes α-2-8-linked oligo-/polysialylated glycomolecules with inhibitory effects on the microglial inflammatory pathways. Recently, the SIGLEC11 gene locus was prioritized as a top tier microglial gene with potential causality to Alzheimer's disease, although its role in inflammation and neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. In this study, aged Siglec-11 transgenic (tg) mice, which expressed the human SIGLEC-11 receptor on microglia and tissue macrophages, were investigated. The brains of the Siglec-11 tg mice were analyzed in 6-month-old mature mice and 24-month-old aged mice using immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics. Results showed decreased density and fewer clusters of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)-positive microglial cells in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, as well as less lipid-laden microglia in the Siglec-11 tg in comparison to wildtype (WT) controls. Additionally, Siglec-11 tg mice exhibited less age-related neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta in comparison to WT mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and inflammatory pathways in Siglec-11 tg brains at 6 months, with further suppression of complement and coagulation cascades at 24 months of age in comparison to WT mice. Gene transcript levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1β) as well as the oxidative stress markers cytochrome b-245 alpha and beta (Cyba and Cybb) and the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), were reduced in the brains of 24-month-old Siglec-11 tg mice relative to WT controls. Brains of 24-month-old Siglec-11 tg mice also exhibited lower gene transcription of complement components 3, 4, and integrin alpha M (C3, C4, and Itgam), along with the complement C1q subcomponents a-c (C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc). In summary, aged Siglec-11 tg mice displayed reduced brain inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as protection against age-related neuronal loss in the substantia nigra.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Robust and interpretable AI-guided marker for early dementia prediction in real-world clinical settings.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Predicting dementia early has major implications for clinical management and patient outcomes. Yet, we still lack sensitive tools for stratifying patients early, resulting in patients being undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed. Despite rapid expansion in machine learning models for dementia prediction, limited model interpretability and generalizability impede translation to the clinic. METHODS: We build a robust and interpretable predictive prognostic model (PPM) and validate its clinical utility using real-world, routinely-collected, non-invasive, and low-cost (cognitive tests, structural MRI) patient data. To enhance scalability and generalizability to the clinic, we: 1) train the PPM with clinically-relevant predictors (cognitive tests, grey matter atrophy) that are common across research and clinical cohorts, 2) test PPM predictions with independent multicenter real-world data from memory clinics across countries (UK, Singapore). FINDINGS: PPM robustly predicts (accuracy: 81.66%, AUC: 0.84, sensitivity: 82.38%, specificity: 80.94%) whether patients at early disease stages (MCI) will remain stable or progress to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). PPM generalizes from research to real-world patient data across memory clinics and its predictions are validated against longitudinal clinical outcomes. PPM allows us to derive an individualized AI-guided multimodal marker (i.e. predictive prognostic index) that predicts progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical markers (grey matter atrophy, cognitive scores; PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio = 3.42, p = 0.01) or clinical diagnosis (PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio = 2.84, p < 0.01), reducing misdiagnosis. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence for a robust and explainable clinical AI-guided marker for early dementia prediction that is validated against longitudinal, multicenter patient data across countries, and has strong potential for adoption in clinical practice.

    "ArticleTitle": "Targeting NLRP3 signaling with a novel sulfonylurea compound for the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: As a key inflammatory factor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of NLRP3 signaling can trigger various inflammatory responses in the brain, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the NLRP3 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including VaD. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a synthetic sulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, in a VaD mouse model using bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. All mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, VaD + Vehicle, and VaD + AMS-17. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) on the 50th day after BCAS. Brain sections and blood serum samples were collected for biomarker analysis and immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration, expressions of the molecules involved in the NLRP3 signaling pathways, tight junction proteins, and myelination were assessed using western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the blood were measured using ELISA. RESULTS: AMS-17 treatment improved cognitive function, enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and promoted remyelination in VaD mice. Additionally, AMS-17 reduced neurodegeneration and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and its associated proteins, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cleaved caspase-1 in the brain. It also lowered pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β levels, while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-4 level in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the first promising evidence for the use of AMS-17 in VaD treatment in mice. This study introduces AMS-17 as a novel chemical scaffold with NLRP3 inhibitory activity, which can be further developed for the treatment of VaD in humans.",

However, the precise genetic impact of COVID-19 on long-term AD development remains unclear. This study leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and genotype data to explore the genetic association between AD and various COVID-19 phenotypes across European ancestry (EA) and African ancestry (AA) cohorts, and the possibility of a causal effect of COVID-19 on AD. We first calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of three COVID-19 phenotypes in AD cases and controls from both EA and AA populations, then determined the genetic associations between COVID-19 PRSs and AD by logistic regression analyses with or without adjusting for age, sex, and APOE genotypes. Significant positive associations were found between AD diagnosis and COVID-19 PRSs in both populations, with the strongest associations identified in the AA population. However, Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses revealed no evidence of a causal effect of COVID-19 phenotypes on AD liability. We explored this finding further through the analysis of shared genomic regions between the COVID-19 phenotypes and AD and found a region of overlap on chromosome 17 that was highly pleiotropic for traits implicating immune function, psychiatric disorders, and lung function phenotypes. These findings suggest that while COVID-19 and AD share overlapping polygenic contributions involving peripheral genes across multiple traits, they lack a direct connection involving core genes that drive the development of their respective pathologies.",

Despite this, the role of HDL-like cholesterol trafficking on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We aimed to examine cholesterol transport via HDL-like particles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients compared to control individuals. Additionally, we explored the ability of reconstituted HDL containing different APOE isoforms to regulate cholesterol transport. We evaluated the capacity of CSF HDL-like particles to facilitate radiolabeled unesterified cholesterol efflux from A172 human glioblastoma astrocytes and to deliver cholesterol to SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells. The HDL-like proteome in the AD and control groups was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Reconstituted HDL nanoparticles were prepared by combining phospholipids and cholesterol with human APOE3 or APOE4, followed by radiolabeling with unesterified cholesterol. Our results showed that cholesterol efflux from astrocytes to CSF were similar between AD patients and controls, both under baseline conditions and after activation of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1. However, CSF HDL-like particle-mediated neuronal cholesterol uptake was significantly reduced in the AD group. LC-MS/MS analysis identified 775 proteins associated with HDL-like particles in both groups, with no major alterations in proteins linked to cholesterol metabolism. However, 27 proteins involved in non-cholesterol-related processes were differentially expressed. Notably, synthetic reconstituted HDL particles containing APOE4 exhibited reduced capacity to deliver cholesterol to neurons compared to those with APOE3. These findings indicate that CSF HDL-like particles from patients with AD demonstrate impaired cholesterol delivery to neurons. Our study highlights APOE4 as a critical contributor to abnormal neuronal cholesterol uptake in AD pathophysiology.",

We used computational analyses to identify common and distinct differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological pathways, vulnerable and disease-driver cell subtypes, and alteration in cell-to-cell interactions. RESULTS: The same vulnerable inhibitory neuron subtype was depleted in both AD and DLB. Potentially disease-driving neuronal cell subtypes were present in both PD and DLB. Cell-cell communication was predicted to be increased in AD but decreased in DLB and PD. DEGs were most commonly shared across NDDs within inhibitory neuron subtypes. Overall, we observed the greatest transcriptomic divergence between AD and PD, while DLB exhibited an intermediate transcriptomic signature. DISCUSSION: These results help explain the clinicopathological spectrum of this group of NDDs and provide unique insights into the shared and distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NDDs.",

ApoE is glycosylated with an O-linked Core-1 sialylated glycan at several sites, yet the impact and function of this glycosylation on AD biomarkers remains unclear. We examined apoE glycosylation in a cohort of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n=181) and plasma (n= 178) samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) stratified into 4 groups: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), progressors and non-progressors based on delayed word recall performance over 4 years. We observed decreasing glycosylation from apoE2 > apoE3 > apoE4 in CSF, and in plasma (apoE3 > apoE4). ApoE glycosylation was reduced in the MCI compared with CN groups, and in progressors compared to non-progressors. In CSF, higher apoE glycosylation associated cross-sectionally with lower total tau (t-tau), p-tau181, and with higher Aβ 1-42 . Similar associations of apoE glycosylation with higher Aβ 1-42 were observed in plasma. In CSF, greater apoE4 glycosylation was associated with lower t-tau and p-tau181. Over a 6-year period, higher baseline levels of CSF apoE glycosylation predicted lower rates of increase in CSF t-tau and p-tau181 and lower rates of decrease in CSF Aβ 1-42 . These results indicate strong associations of apoE glycosylation with biomarkers of AD pathology independent of apoE genotype, warranting a deeper understanding of the functional role of apoE glycosylation on AD tau pathology.",

    "ArticleTitle": "APOE4 Increases Susceptibility to Amyloid, Accelerating Episodic Memory Decline.",
    "AbstractText": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with one copy of APOE4 exhibit greater amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition compared to noncarriers, an effect that is even more pronounced in APOE4 homozygotes. Interestingly, APOE4 carriers not only show more AD pathology but also experience more rapid cognitive decline, particularly in episodic memory. The underlying mechanisms driving this domain-specific vulnerability, however, remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the accelerated decline in episodic memory among APOE4 carriers is due to increased Aβ deposition or heightened susceptibility to Aβ-related effects. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Initiative, we modeled amyloid duration, the estimated number of years an individual has been amyloid-positive, and its impact on cognitive trajectories. Our findings reveal that APOE4 is associated with more rapid episodic memory decline as a function of amyloid duration. This decline was dose-dependent, with APOE4 homozygotes declining more rapidly than heterozygotes, and it was consistently observed across multiple episodic memory tasks and measures. Importantly, this pattern was not observed in other cognitive domains, such as processing speed, executive function, visuospatial skills, language, or crystallized intelligence. These results suggest that cognitive trajectories in AD differ by APOE genotype, with APOE4 conferring increased vulnerability to hippocampal dysfunction early in the disease course. Future research should investigate whether these cognitive differences stem from distinct pathological cascades in APOE4 carriers.",

    "AbstractText": "Excess lipid droplet (LD) accumulation is associated with several pathological states, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the 'neutral' E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia 'omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells' immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested - at baseline and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4 .",

Focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO) noninvasively opens the BBB, allowing increased molecular transport to and from the brain parenchyma. Despite being initially developed as a drug delivery method, FUS-BBBO has shown promise both as a neuroimmunotherapeutic modality, and as a way of improving neurological disease diagnosis via amplification of disease biomarker circulation. Recently, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in modulating the neuroimmune system and in improving biomarker detection has sparked research interest. However, despite their potential role in modulating FUS-BBBO-induced neuroimmunotherapy and their ability to improve biomarker specificity after treatment, the EV response to FUS-BBBO had not been extensively characterized prior to this study.

Patient EV concentration also increased one hour after treatment and was dependent on the volume of BBB opening three days post-treatment. Furthermore, EV isolation was found to significantly enhance the amplification of AD biomarker detection by FUS-BBBO.

Cognitive dysfunction is common in major depressive disorder (MDD), but whether bile acids impact these networks in MDD patients is unknown. METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and blood measures of four bile acids from 74 treatment-naïve adults with MDD were analyzed. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seeds were used to examine connectivity of the ECN and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seeds were used for the DMN. Using a whole-brain analysis, the functional connectivity of these seeds was correlated with serum levels chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and its bacterially-derived secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA). RESULTS: CDCA levels were strongly and inversely correlated with connectivity between DLPFC regions of the ECN (R 2 = .401, p<.001). LCA levels were strongly and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC and left inferior temporal cortex of the ECN (R 2 =.263, p<.001). The LCA/CDCA ratio was strongly and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC with two components of the ECN: bilateral inferior temporal cortex and the left superior and inferior parietal lobules (all R 2 >.24, all p<.001). For the DMN, the LCA/CDCA ratio was strongly and negatively correlated with connectivity of the PCC with multiple bilateral insula regions (all R 2 >0.25, all p<.001).

We examined the medial habenulainterpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN), as this circuit plays crucial roles in mood regulation, has been linked to the development of diabetes after smoking, and is rich in cholinergic neurons, which are affected in other brain areas in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia, a type 1 diabetes model, on mitochondrial and lipid homeostasis in 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed sections from the MHb and IPN of C57BL/6 J male mice, using a recently developed automated pipeline for mitochondrial analysis in confocal images. We examined different time points after STZ-induced diabetes onset to determine how the brain responded to chronic hyperglycemia, with the limitation that mitochondria and lipids were not examined with respect to cell type or intracellular location. RESULTS: Mitochondrial distribution and morphology differentially responded to hyperglycemia depending on time and brain area. Six weeks after STZ treatment, mitochondria in the ventral MHb and dorsal IPN increased in number and exhibited altered morphology, but no changes were observed in the lateral habenula (LHb) or ventral IPN. Strikingly, mitochondrial numbers returned to normal dynamics at 12 weeks. Both blood glucose level and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) correlated with mitochondrial dynamics in ventral MHb, whereas only HbA1C correlated in the IPN. We also examined lipid homeostasis using BODIPY staining for neutral lipids in this model given that diabetes is associated with disrupted lipid homeostasis. BODIPY staining intensity was unchanged in the vMHb of STZ-treated mice but increased in the IPN and VTA and decreased in the LHb at 12 weeks. Interestingly, areas that demonstrated changes in mitochondria had little change in lipid staining and vice versa. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to describe the specific impacts of diabetes on mitochondria in the MHb-IPN circuit and suggests that the cholinergic MHb is uniquely sensitive to diabetesinduced hyperglycemia. Further studies are needed to understand the functional and behavioral implications of these findings.",

At the same time, we plotted ROC curves for the difference in the change of plasma GSTα protein levels after 1 year of follow-up. The results showed that the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels change for MCI was 0.76 (0.696-0.83), p < 0.001, and the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels change for AD was 0.75 (0.69-0.80), p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicated notable differences in GSTα protein levels among patients with MCI and those with AD after a one-year follow-up period. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between changes in GST αprotein levels and the decline in both baseline and cognitive function. This suggests that GSTα protein could potentially act as a biomarker for both MCI and AD, offering fresh insights for early detection and intervention strategies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The blood metabolome of cognitive function and brain health in middle-aged adults - influences of genes, gut microbiome, and exposome.",
    "AbstractText": "Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of metabolic alterations in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and highlights the significance of the peripheral metabolome, influenced by genetic factors and modifiable environmental exposures, for brain health. In this study, we examined 1,387 metabolites in plasma samples from 1,082 dementia-free middle-aged participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. We assessed the relation of metabolites with general cognition (G-factor) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers using linear regression and estimated the variance of these metabolites explained by genes, gut microbiome, lifestyle factors, common clinical comorbidities, and medication using gradient boosting decision tree analysis. Twenty-one metabolites and one metabolite were significantly associated with total brain volume and total white matter lesions, respectively. Fourteen metabolites showed significant associations with G-factor, with ergothioneine exhibiting the largest effect (adjusted mean difference = 0.122, P = 4.65×10-7). Associations for nine of the 14 metabolites were replicated in an independent, older cohort. The metabolite signature of incident AD in the replication cohort resembled that of cognition in the discovery cohort, emphasizing the potential relevance of the identified metabolites to disease pathogenesis. Lifestyle, clinical variables, and medication were most important in determining these metabolites' blood levels, with lifestyle, explaining up to 28.6% of the variance. Smoking was associated with ten metabolites linked to G-factor, while diabetes and antidiabetic medication were associated with 13 metabolites linked to MRI markers, including N-lactoyltyrosine. Antacid medication strongly affected ergothioneine levels. Mediation analysis revealed that lower ergothioneine levels may partially mediate negative effects of antacids on cognition (31.5%). Gut microbial factors were more important for the blood levels of metabolites that were more strongly associated with cognition and incident AD in the older replication cohort (beta-cryptoxanthin, imidazole propionate), suggesting they may be involved later in the disease process. The detailed results on how multiple modifiable factors affect blood levels of cognition- and brain imaging-related metabolites in dementia-free participants may help identify new AD prevention strategies.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Stratification of Alzheimer's Disease Patients Using Knowledge-Guided Unsupervised Latent Factor Clustering with Electronic Health Record Data.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit varying clinical trajectories. There is a need to predict future AD-related outcomes such as morbidity and mortality using clinical profile at the point of care. OBJECTIVE: To stratify AD patients based on baseline clinical profiles (up to two years prior to AD diagnosis) and update the model after AD diagnosis to prognosticate future AD-related outcomes. METHODS: Using the electronic health record (EHR) data of a large healthcare system (2011-2022), we first identified patients with ≥1 diagnosis code for AD or related dementia and applied a validated unsupervised phenotyping algorithm to assign AD diagnosis status. Next, we applied an unsupervised latent factor clustering approach, guided by knowledge graph embeddings of relevant EHR features up to the baseline, to cluster patients into two groups at AD diagnosis. We then prognosticated the risk of two readily ascertainable and clinically relevant AD-related outcomes ( i.e., nursing home admission indicating greater need for assistance and mortality), adjusting for baseline confounders ( e.g., age, gender, race, ethnicity, healthcare utilization, and comorbidities). For patients remaining at risk one year post-diagnosis, we updated their group membership and repeated the prognostication. RESULTS: We stratified 16,411 algorithm-identified AD patients into two groups based on their baseline clinical profiles (41% Group 1, 59% Group 2). Patients in Group 1 were marginally older at AD diagnosis (age Mean [SD]: 81.4 [9.3] vs 81.0 [8.7], p =.007), exhibited greater comorbidity burden (Elixhauser comorbidity index Mean [SD]: 11.3 [10.3] vs 7.5 [8.6], p <.0001), and more frequently received AD-related medications (47.7% vs 40.9%, p <.0001) than those in Group 2. Compared to Group 1, Group 2 had a lower risk of nursing home admission (HR [95% CI]=0.804 [0.765, 0.844], p <.001), while the two groups had similar mortality risk (HR [95% CI]=1.008 [0.963, 1.056], p =.733). One year after AD diagnosis, 12,606 patients remained at risk (45.7% Group 1, 54.3% Group 2). Consistent with baseline findings, Group 2 had a lower risk of nursing home admission than (HR [95% CI]=0.815 [0.766, 0.868], p <.001) and similar mortality risk as (HR [95% CI]=0.977 [0.922, 1.035], p =0.430) Group 1 in the updated model. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to stratify patients based on readily available clinical profiles before AD diagnosis and crucially to update the model one year after diagnosis to effectively prognosticate future AD-related outcomes. SHORT ABSTRACT: Prognostication for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the point of care could improve clinical management. Applying a novel unsupervised latent factor clustering approach guided by knowledge graph embeddings of relevant clinical features from electronic health records, we stratified 16,411 AD patients into two groups at diagnosis and prognosticated their risk of AD-related outcomes ( i.e., nursing home admission, mortality), adjusting for baseline confounders. To reflect real-world evolution in clinical trajectories, we updated patient stratification for 12,606 AD patients remaining at risk 1-year post-diagnosis and repeated prognostication. At both timepoints, one group had a higher nursing home admission risk and exhibited characteristics suggesting greater symptom burden, but the mortality risk remained comparable between groups. This study supports that patient stratification can enable outcome prognosis for AD patients. While baseline prognostication can guide early treatment and tailored management, dynamic prognostication may inform more timely interventions to improve long-term outcomes.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 is a promising blood biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most p-tau217 assays have been validated solely in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma, leaving the clinical applicability of serum p-tau217 largely unexplored despite serum being a preferred matrix in many clinical laboratories. To address this gap, we compared p-tau217 concentrations and diagnostic performances in matched plasma and serum samples using four research-use-only assays, including three from commercial sources i.e., Lumipulse, ALZpath, NULISA, and one from University of Pittsburgh. METHODS: Paired plasma and serum samples were processed from the same venipuncture collection and assessed with the four p-tau217 assays following manufacturer-recommended procedures in two research cohorts (N=84). RESULTS: Plasma and serum p-tau217 levels varied across assays; the ALZpath, Pittsburgh, and NULISA methods showed significantly lower p-tau217 levels in serum compared with plasma (p<0.0001), while Lumipulse showed higher or non-significant differences in serum. Yet, strong correlations (rho >0.8) were observed between plasma and serum p-tau217 pairs. Both plasma and serum p-tau217 demonstrated strong classification accuracies to differentiate clinical AD from normal controls, with high AUC (up to 0.963) for all methods. The exception was the Pittsburgh assay, where plasma p-tau217 had superior AUC than serum p-tau217 (plasma: 0.912, serum: 0.844). The rest of the assays had equivalent accuracies in both matrices. CONCLUSIONS: Serum p-tau217 performs equivalently as plasma p-tau217 for most assessed assays. Serum can therefore be used in place of plasma for p-tau217 assessment for research and clinical purposes.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: The 2024 Alzheimer's Association (AA) research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) considers fluid biomarkers, including promising blood-based biomarkers for detecting AD. This study aims to identify dementia subtypes and their cognitive and neuroimaging profiles in older adults with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using biomarkers and clinical data. METHODS: Forty-five individuals with dementia over 65 years old were evaluated using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia and the informant-based Alzheimer's Questionnaire. Core AD biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and p-tau181) and non-specific neurodegeneration biomarkers (NfL, GFAP) were measured in blood plasma. Neuroimaging structures were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia subtypes were determined based on plasma biomarker pathology and vascular markers. Biomarker cutoff scores were identified to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Individuals were stratified into one of four dementia subtypes - AD only, non-AD vascular, non-AD other, or mixed - based on combinations of abnormalities in these markers. RESULTS: Among the 45 individuals with dementia, mixed dementia had the highest prevalence (42.4%), followed by AD-only (24.4%), non-AD other dementia (22.2%), and non-AD vascular dementia subtypes (11.1%). Both cognitive and neuroimaging profiles aligned poorly with biomarker classifications in the full sample. Cognitive tests varied across dementia subtypes. The cognitive profile of the AD-only and mixed groups suggested relatively low cognitive performance, while the non-AD and other groups had the best scores on average. CONCLUSION: Consistent with studies in other settings, our preliminary findings suggest that neurodegenerative plasma biomarkers may help to identify dementia subtypes and provide insight into cognitive and neuroimaging profiles among older adults in the DRC.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The long-term impact of opioid use disorder (OUD) on brain health has been little explored although of potentially high public health importance. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential causal impact of OUD on later life brain health outcomes, including dementia, stroke and brain structure. METHODS: Observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted. Participants included in observational analyses were enrolled in the US Million Veteran Program (MVP). Cox proportional hazards were used to examine the association between electronic health record (EHR)-derived diagnoses of OUD and incident dementia in European and African ancestry populations. Two-sample MR was applied to explore the association between genetic predisposition to OUD and dementia, as well as key endophenotypes including brain structure. Several analyses were used for insight into aetiological pathways, including cis-MR to assess the impact of genetically-proxied opioid receptor perturbation, Bayesian colocalization, and polygenic risk score analyses of longitudinal brain changes in non-opioid users from the Lifebrain project (n=229). RESULTS: Amongst 222,518 MVP participants, 8397 developed dementia during follow up. Participants with OUD (n=9,399) were younger and more likely to be male. In observational analyses, OUD was associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR]=1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.39,1.76];p=2.23×10 -13 ), Alzheimer's [HR=1.40[1.04,1.87]; p=0.02) and vascular dementia (HR=1.49[1.19,1.86];p=0.0004). In the genetic analysis, genetically-proxied OUD also associated with higher dementia risk. A doubling in genetically-proxied OUD prevalence was associated with a 77% increase in odds of dementia (IVW OR=1.77[1.43,2.19];p=1.69×10 ⁻⁷ ). Variation in μ-opioid receptor genes were strongly associated with dementia risk. No significant associations were observed with brain structure in non-opioid users, nor in lower powered non-European ancestry groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential causal impact of opioid use disorder on dementia. Genetic analyses supported an aetiological role of μ-opioid receptor pathways. Further pharmacovigilance and investigation into the long-term effects of opioids on brain health are warranted.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common brain disorder among the elderly and individuals with Alzheimer's disease, where accumulation of amyloid-ß can lead to intracerebral hemorrhage and dementia. This review discusses recent developments in understanding the pathophysiology and phenotypes of CAA. RECENT FINDINGS: CAA has a long preclinical phase starting decades before symptoms emerge. Its pathophysiology follows consecutive stages of amyloid-ß deposition, decreased vascular reactivity, nonhemorrhagic changes, and ultimately hemorrhages. Although impaired perivascular clearance is the leading hypothesis underlying CAA, several lines of evidence suggest that glymphatic dysfunction also plays a significant role in the disease process. Despite its common pathway, the disease course is variable. Some patients develop more microbleeds, while others develop larger hemorrhages, suggesting a differentiation in vascular remodeling. Some patients with CAA develop a symptomatic immune response, and inflammation could be an important contributor to vascular damage in CAA in general. Furthermore, the prion-like transmission of amyloid-β has been identified as a cause of iatrogenic CAA occurring decades after neurosurgical procedures involving cadaveric dura mater. SUMMARY: Emerging evidence of sporadic, hereditary, inflammatory, and iatrogenic CAA suggests a complex interplay between brain clearance, inflammation and vascular remodeling leading to a diverse clinical phenotype.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Cell-type specific epigenetic clocks to quantify biological age at cell-type resolution.",
    "AbstractText": "The ability to accurately quantify biological age could help monitor and control healthy aging. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as promising tools for estimating biological age, yet they have been developed from heterogeneous bulk tissues, and are thus composites of two aging processes, one reflecting the change of cell-type composition with age and another reflecting the aging of individual cell-types. There is thus a need to dissect and quantify these two components of epigenetic clocks, and to develop epigenetic clocks that can yield biological age estimates at cell-type resolution. Here we demonstrate that in blood and brain, approximately 39% and 12% of an epigenetic clock's accuracy is driven by underlying shifts in lymphocyte and neuronal subsets, respectively. Using brain and liver tissue as prototypes, we build and validate neuron and hepatocyte specific DNA methylation clocks, and demonstrate that these cell-type specific clocks yield improved estimates of chronological age in the corresponding cell and tissue-types. We find that neuron and glia specific clocks display biological age acceleration in Alzheimer's Disease with the effect being strongest for glia in the temporal lobe. Moreover, CpGs from these clocks display a small but significant overlap with the causal DamAge-clock, mapping to key genes implicated in neurodegeneration. The hepatocyte clock is found accelerated in liver under various pathological conditions. In contrast, non-cell-type specific clocks do not display biological age-acceleration, or only do so marginally. In summary, this work highlights the importance of dissecting epigenetic clocks and quantifying biological age at cell-type resolution.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Society commonly believes that research knowledge is complementary to public decision-making. This study aimed to understand the perspectives and implications of dementia researchers communicating with policymakers and public research decision-makers (public officials). METHODS: This study uses 24 questions from an anonymous, online survey, which was received by 392 members of nine European, Latin American, and United States medical researcher associations/networks in the fields of age-related neurological degeneration and dementia medicine. The data were analyzed via crosstab analysis, two group comparison analyses, and a logistic regression model. RESULTS: In total, 91 (23.2%) respondents completed the questionnaire. Eight independent variables were related to researchers' research discipline, research remuneration, experience, authorship, H-index, and research grants. The statistically significant variables determining whether the respondents had contact with public officials were \"Years of research experience\" (p = 0.004), \"Number of articles first-authored in the last 5 years\" (p = 0.007), and \"Average H-index in the last 5 years\" (p = 0.048) [median (IQR)]; 47% of the surveyed researchers had been in contact with public officials in the last 12 months. The most frequently communicated topics were the importance of their own research to society (61%) and their own funding (60%); 87% (n = 79) of the researchers did not believe that public officials had a very good understanding of their dementia research. CONCLUSION: Less than half (47%) of dementia researchers communicate with public officials, and they communicate mostly about the importance of their own research and funding their own research.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and cognitive impairments. Previous studies have shown neuronal death in the brains of AD patients, but the role of cuproptosis and its associated genes in AD neurons remains unclear. METHODS: Intersection analysis was conducted using the AD transcriptome dataset GSE63060, neuron dataset GSE147528, and reported cuproptosis-related genes to identify the cuproptosis key gene FDX1 highly expressed in AD. Subsequently, cell experiments were performed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ25-35 to establish AD cell model. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) assays were employed to detect the expression levels of FDX1, DLAT, and DLST. Cell proliferation was analyzed by counting Kit-8 (CCK8), mitochondrial ROS levels were analyzed using flow cytometry. shRNA was used to downregulate FDX1 expression, followed by repetition of the aforementioned experiments. Clinical experiments utilized qPCR to detect FDX1 mRNA levels in peripheral venous blood of patients, and analyzed FDX1 expression differences in different APOE genotypes of AD patients. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of FDX1 was constructed based on the GeneMANIA database, immune infiltration analysis was conducted using R language, and transcription factors prediction for FDX1 was performed based on the ENCODE database. RESULTS: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 showed significantly higher expression in peripheral blood and neuron models of AD compared to non-AD individuals, with significantly higher expression in APOE ε4/ε4 genotype than other APOE genotype of AD patients. Knockdown of FDX1 expression reduced the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST in neurons, alleviated ROS accumulation in mitochondria, improved cell viability, and mitigated cuproptosis. Immune infiltration analysis results indicated a high enrichment of peripheral blood γδ-T lymphocytes in AD, and FDX1 was significantly associated with the infiltration of four immune cells and may be regulated by three transcription factors. CONCLUSION: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 is highly expressed in AD and may promote cuproptosis in AD neurons by regulating the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST, thereby participating in the onset and development of AD.

While vision, hearing, olfaction, and vestibular function have each been shown to be related to ADRD, their causal relations to cognitive declines, how they interact with each other remains to be clarified. Currently, there is substantial debate whether sensory/perceptual systems that fail early in disease progression are causal in their contributions to cognitive load and/or social isolation or are simply coincident declines due to aging. At the same time, substantial declines in any of these senses requires compensation, can strain other neural processes and impact activities of daily living, including social engagement, quality of life, and the risk of falls. In this perspective piece, we review literature that illustrates the different relationships between sensory/perceptual systems, cognitive aging and ADRD.

RESULTS: A total of 602 publications were analyzed using various online platforms for bibliometric analysis. Notably, the number of publications began to increase rapidly in 2018, with China and the United States emerging as leaders in this research area. The National Institute on Aging produced the highest number of publications among institutions.

    "AbstractText": "In early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition can induce neuronal hyperactivity, thereby potentially triggering activity-dependent neuronal secretion of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), ensuing tau aggregation and spread. Therefore, cortical excitability is a candidate biomarker for early AD detection. Moreover, lowering neuronal excitability could potentially complement strategies to reduce Aβ and tau buildup. There is, however, a lack of understanding of the relationship between cortical excitability and p-tau increase in vivo. Therefore, in a sample of 658 healthy middle-aged (between the ages of 40 and 65) participants of the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative cohort study, we examined the relation of blood-based tau, phosphorylated at amino acid 181 (p-tau181), reflecting neuronal p-tau secretion; neurofilament light chain (NfL), as a passively released control for p-tau181; and electroencephalography (EEG) markers of cortical excitability. A subsample of 47 participants also completed a controlled brain perturbation approach via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent EEG. Results show that both spontaneous (i.e., resting-state) and perturbation-based TMS-EEG markers, are associated with blood p-tau181, particularly in older individuals. The perturbation-based marker was a significantly more sensitive predictor of p-tau181 concentration than the spontaneous resting state EEG-based marker. The relationships observed are not present for the NfL control. These results show that relationships between p-tau181 and cortical excitability are present in healthy middle-aged subjects and that p-tau181 increases may reflect activity-dependent secretion.",

Neurons generally have one long axon and multiple shorter dendrites, marked by specific microtubule (MT)-associated proteins, e.g., MAP2 for dendrites and TAU for axons, while the scaffolding proteins AnkG and TRIM46 mark the axon-initial-segment. In tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), TAU sorting, and neuronal polarity are disrupted, leading to MT loss. However, modeling and studying MTs in human neuronal cells relevant to the study of AD and TAU-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) is challenging. To study MT dynamics in human neurons, we compared two cell culture systems: SH-SY5Y-derived neurons (SHN) and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iN). Using immunostaining and EB3-tdTomato time-lapse imaging, we found AnkG absent in SHN but present in iN, while TRIM46 was present in both. TAU and MAP2 showed axonal and dendritic enrichment, respectively, similar to mouse primary neurons. Both neuron types exhibited polarized MT structures, with unidirectional MTs in axons and bidirectional MTs in dendrites. Polymerization speeds were similar; however, iNs had more retrograde MT growth events, while SHN showed a higher overall number of growth events. Thus, SHN and iN are both suitable for studying neuronal cell polarity, with SHN being particularly suitable if the focus is not the AIS.",

Causal discovery often faces challenges due to unmeasured confounders that hinder the identification of causal relationships. The proposed approach addresses this issue by developing two peeling algorithms (bottom-up and top-down) to ascertain causal relationships and valid instruments. This approach first reconstructs a super-graph to represent ancestral relationships between variables, using a peeling algorithm based on nodewise GLM regressions that exploit relationships between primary and instrumental variables. Then, it estimates parent-child effects from the ancestral relationships using another peeling algorithm while deconfounding a child's model with information borrowed from its parents' models. The article offers a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, establishing conditions for model identifiability and providing statistical guarantees for accurately discovering parent-child relationships via the peeling algorithms. Furthermore, the article presents numerical experiments showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to state-of-the-art structure learning methods without confounders.

In neurons, imbalances in Zn2+ levels have been implicated as risk factors in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration, highlighting the pivotal role of Zn2+ homeostasis in neuropathologies. In addition, Zn2+ modulates the function of plasma membrane proteins, including ion channels and receptors. Changes in Zn2+ levels, on both sides of the plasma membrane, profoundly impact signaling pathways governing cell development, differentiation, and survival. This review is focused on recent developments of neuronal Zn2+ homeostasis, including the impact of Zn2+ dyshomeostasis in neurological disorders, therapeutic approaches, and the increasingly recognized role of Zn2+ as a neurotransmitter in the brain.",

    "AbstractText": "PURPOSE: The aim is to provide new insights for researchers studying the pathogenesis of diabetic cognitive dysfunction and promoting the wider use of natural products in their treatment. METHOD: First, the Web of Science Core Collection was selected as the data source for a computerized literature search on oxidative stress and diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD). Next, Biblimetrix and VOSviewer performed statistical analysis focusing on publication countries, institutions, authors, research hotspots, and emerging directions in the field. Then, through the analysis of keywords and key articles, the forefront of the field is identified. Finally, we discussed the pathogenesis of DCD, the influence of oxidative stress on DCD and the antioxidant effect of natural products on DCD. RESULT: 293 valid papers were obtained. Bibliometrics showed that oxidative stress, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive decline, insulin resistance and quercetin were the key words of the symbiotic network. CONCLUSION: The antioxidant effects of natural products in improving DCD have been extensively studied in preclinical studies, providing potential for their treatment in DCD, but their evaluation in clinical trials is currently uncommon.",

    "AbstractText": "In this study, an acid-assisted extraction strategy was used to extract a novel polysaccharide (ACP) from Asparagus cochinchinensis, after which this polysaccharide was purified and subjected to extensive characterization. ACP was determined to have an average molecular weight of 15,580 Da in structural characterization studies, and it was found to primarily consist of glucose, galactose, L-fucose, and fructose at an 82.14:12.23:2.61:2.49 ratio. Trace amounts of xylose, arabinose, and rhamnose were also detected in ACP preparations at a 0.48:0.04:0.02 ratio. GC-MS analyses identified eight different sugar linkages within ACP, including Glcp-(1→, →2)-Glcp-(1→, →6)-Glcp-(1→, →4)-Glcp-(1→, →3, 4)-Glcp-(1→, →2,4) -Galp-(1→, →4,6)-Galp-(1→, and →3,4,6)-Galp-(1 → linkages present at 23.70:1.30:3.55:50.77:6.91:1.10:11.50:1.18 molar percent ratios. One-dimensional NMR, two-dimensional NMR, and methylation analyses ultimately revealed that the polysaccharide is mainly composed of →4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → and a small amount→4,6)-α-D-Galp-(1 → and →3,4)-α-D-Glcp-(1 → and so on. Branched chain is mainly composed of α-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → connected to the sugar residues α-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → O-4 position or sugar residues of α-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → O-3 position. ACP treatment in SAMP8 mice was associated with reductions in oxidative stress and brain pathology together with enhanced cognitive function. ACP treated SAMP8 mice also presented with increases in Bacteroidota abundance and reduced Firmicutes, Patescibacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Campilobacterota abundance. Thus, ACP can prevent Alzheimer's disease by modulating the microbe-gut-brain axis.",

    "AbstractText": "Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an enzyme crucial in epigenetic regulation and protein degradation, with implications in various cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. While HDAC6 is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, its involvement in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) remains underexplored. Currently, there are no direct methods available for characterizing HDAC6 in the brains of living subjects. Positron emission tomography (PET) techniques offer a noninvasive approach to visualize HDAC6, potentially enhancing our understanding of its neuropathological roles. In this study, we present the synthesis and PET imaging of [18F]3, an 18F-labeled 5-aroylindole derivative, which exhibits favorable affinity for HDAC6. The synthesis of [18F]3 was achieved through microwave-assisted radiofluorination of a nitro-precursor, followed by hydroxamic acid formation. PET studies using [18F]3 in SCA17 transgenic mice revealed significantly increased radioactivity in the brain compared to wild-type mice, particularly evident in the cerebellum and hippocampus. These findings warrant the potential utility of 18F-labeled 5-aroylindole derivatives as PET radioligands for HDAC6 neuroimaging and advocate for further exploration in structural optimization endeavors.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Hederagenin (HG), derived from ivy seeds, is known to offer protection against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific molecular pathways through which it counters ferroptosis-induced neurotoxicity are not fully elucidated. This investigation seeks to delineate the processes by which HG mitigates neurotoxic effects in HT22 cells subjected to glutamate (Glu)-induced ferroptosis. METHODS: HT22 cell ferroptosis was prompted by Glu exposure. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 and LDH assays, while Fe2+ fluorescence and assays of iron-related proteins served to gauge intracellular Fe2+ concentrations. Evaluations of mitochondrial structure and functionality employed JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy. Assessments of ROS, lipid peroxidation, MDA, 4-HNE, and the GSSG/GSH ratio were conducted to ascertain HG's antioxidative efficacy. The expression of proteins within the PPARα/Nrf2/GPX4 pathway was quantified via western blotting, with molecular docking (MD), and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) used to explore protein interactions. RESULTS: HG diminished the cellular toxicity triggered by Glu in HT22 cells, lowered Fe2+ within cells, and rejuvenated mitochondrial morphology and performance. Concurrently, it modulated proteins critical to Fe2+ metabolism, diminished ROS and lipid peroxidation, and elevated GSH/GSSG ratios. Enhanced PPARα/Nrf2/GPX4 protein levels were corroborated by western blot results. Furthermore, molecular docking revealed favorable binding of HG to the proteins PPARα, Nrf2, and GPX4, with binding energies of -7.751, -7.535, and -7.414 kcal/mol, respectively. MDS confirmed robust interactions between HG and these pivotal targets. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that HG effectively mitigates Glu-induced ferroptosis in HT22 cells by activating the PPARα/Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway. These findings endorse HG's potential as a nutritional adjunct for AD management.",

    "AbstractText": "We have identified FLT1 as a protein that changes during Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereby higher brain protein levels are associated with more amyloid, more tau, and faster longitudinal cognitive decline. Given FLT1's role in angiogenesis and immune activation, we hypothesized that FLT1 is upregulated in response to amyloid pathology, driving a vascular-immune cascade resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We sought to determine (1) if in vivo FLT1 levels (CSF and plasma) associate with biomarkers of AD neuropathology or differ between diagnostic staging in an aged cohort enriched for early disease, and (2) whether FLT1 expression interacts with amyloid on downstream outcomes, such as phosphorylated tau levels and cognitive performance. Additionally, we sought to replicate FLT1 interactions in the brain. The results showed that higher levels of FLT1 in CSF and post-mortem brain tissue related to increased tau, particularly among amyloid positive individuals. These analyses help clarify the potential utility of FLT1 as a biomarker among individuals with evidence of brain amyloidosis.",

This study aimed to investigate the associations of tea consumption, including status, frequency, and type, with cognitive function, considering selection bias. METHODS: We used data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2018(N = 8498). Cognitive function was measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Logistic and linear regression were applied to assess the associations of tea consumption with cognitive impairment and cognitive scores, respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to balance characteristic differences between groups. RESULTS: The characteristics of tea consumption status, frequency and type were well balanced between groups after using PSM and IPTW. Drinking tea was associated with less cognitive impairment (ORadjusted:0.84, ORPSM:0.84, ORIPTW:0.87) and higher cognitive scores (Coefficientadjusted:0.29, CoefficientPSM:0.33, CoefficientIPTW:0.29). Regular tea drinkers may have better cognitive function than those who never or rarely consumed (Ptrend < 0.05 for both methods). Green tea drinkers had lower prevalence of cognitive impairment (ORadjusted:0.71, ORIPTW:0.75) and higher cognitive scores (Coefficientadjusted:0.45, CoefficientIPTW:0.54). Men, uneducated, and those with annual income>10,000 RMB were more likely to benefit from flower tea. Significant interactions of tea consumption with age, education and income were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Tea consumption, especially regular and green tea consumption, was associated with less cognitive impairment and higher cognitive scores, even after PSM and IPTW adjustments. Flower teas may have potential protective effect that is worth further study. Age, education and income have synergistic effects with tea consumption on cognitive function.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The neuropathology of AD appears in the hippocampus. The purpose of this work was to reveal key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hippocampus of AD patients and healthy individuals. Furthermore, we established an in vivo AD-like model to validate and explore the effects of exercise on these risky genes. The datasets GSE36980 and GSE48350 were downloaded from the GEO database and visualized using R packages to obtain DEGs. Subsequently, the potential biological functions of these DEGs were predicted, PPI network interactions were screened for core genes, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed. Additionally, we determined the diagnostic value of core DEGs using ROC curves. Single-cell analysis was used to verify the cell type specificity of hub genes. Finally, we used RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence to validate the expression of core DEGs in model mice and to explore the beneficial mechanisms of exercise. A total of 13 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the development of AD were identified, comprising 11 down-regulated genes and 2 up-regulated genes. PPI network visualization acquired four down-regulated core DEGs with good diagnostic value. The findings from the in vivo study indicated that the mRNA expression of GABRA1, GABRG2, and SVOP decreased, and the astrocyte marker GFAP notably increased in AD mice. Surprisingly, exercise increased hippocampal GABRA1 and GABRG2 expression and decreased GFAP-positive intensity of GABRG1 localization, reducing expression of inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-1β. In addition, exercise improved the spatial exploration ability but had little effect on the preference index in AD mice. Our data highlighted the mechanism by which exercise improves memory performance in AD patients by reducing astrocyte neurotoxicity inducing decreased hippocampal GABA receptor expression.",

The aim of our meta-analysis was to review the available literature to assess the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of the two most common neurological diseases: Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Two medical databases were searched: Web of Science and PubMed in the period from 2009-2023, where a total of 37 publications that met the inclusion criteria were selected for further evaluation. Both patients with AD and with PD showed statistically significantly higher levels of interleukin IL-6 compared to the control group: p-value of 0.0034 for AD (SMD, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.39-1.96) and p-value of 0.0487 for PD (SMD 0.29 95% Cl 0.00-0.59). In AD patients, statistical significance (for random effect) was also observed for IL-1β, where higher values of this cytokine were recorded in patients compared to controls (p-value <0.001). In turn, in patients with PD, apart from IL-6, statistical significance was also observed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p= 0.0431, SMD 0.52 95%Cl 0.02-1.02). Significant heterogeneity was also recorded (Q =85.48; P < 0.01; I2 = 87%). In both study groups, significant differences in common effect were observed for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which could suggest a protective effect of this cytokine in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

    "AbstractText": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death driven by oxidative stress, plays a crucial role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aging diminishes antioxidant systems that maintain iron homeostasis, particularly affecting the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) system, leading to increased ferroptosis and exacerbated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in AD. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor regulating genes involved in antioxidant defense and ferroptosis. In this review, we examine the interconnected roles of Nrf2 signaling, iron metabolism, and ferroptosis in AD, and discuss how regular physical exercise-known to enhance antioxidant capacity-might influence these processes. Despite evidence linking exercise to improved cognitive function in AD and its role in modulating oxidative stress, there is a paucity of research specifically addressing how exercise affects ferroptosis in the AD brain. To address this gap, we utilized bioinformatics techniques to identify potential pathways and mechanisms by which exercise may mitigate ferroptosis in AD through Nrf2 signaling. Analyzing gene expression profiles from the GEO database, we identified differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes in the hippocampus following exercise intervention. Hub genes like SLC2A1, TXN, MEF2C, and KRAS were significantly upregulated, suggesting that exercise may activate a network enhancing antioxidant defenses and regulating iron metabolism via Nrf2. Our findings propose a novel mechanism whereby exercise alleviates abnormal ferroptosis in the AD brain through modulation of Nrf2 signaling. This study highlights the need for further research to validate these findings and explore exercise as a therapeutic strategy for AD by targeting ferroptosis.",

Gastrodin (GAS), a principal bioactive constituent of Gastrodia elata Blume, is neuroprotective in various neurological disorders, including ischemic stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain. In this study, we sought to investigate whether GAS could serve as a protective agent against SAE. Methods: Mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or the murine brain microvascular endothelial cell bEnd.3 was exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequently treated with GAS. We assessed neurological deficits, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, neuroinflammation, and the state of ferroptosis to evaluate the regulation of GAS on SAE. Mechanistically, we utilized glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) knockout mice to delineate the crucial role of GPX4 and examined the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway to uncover the upstream signaling of GPX4. Results: GAS mitigated neurological deficits in SAE mice and reduced BBB disruption and neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro . Functionally, the neuroprotective effects of GAS were realized through the inhibition of ferroptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPX4 played a pivotal role in this process. Lastly, we found that the COX-2/PGE2 pathway was activated following GAS treatment in SAE mice, thereby increasing the expression level of GPX4. Conclusions: Our study elucidated that GAS offers protection against SAE by suppressing ferroptosis through the activation of the COX-2/PGE2/GPX4 axis.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Age-related hippocampal atrophy is associated with memory loss in older adults, and certain hippocampal subfields are more vulnerable to age-related atrophy than others. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be an important protective factor for preserving hippocampal volume, but little is known about how CRF relates to the volume of specific hippocampal subfields, and whether associations between CRF and hippocampal subfield volumes are related to episodic memory performance. To address these gaps, the current study evaluates the associations among baseline CRF, hippocampal subfield volumes, and episodic memory performance in cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) (NCT02875301). METHODS: Participants (N = 601, ages 65-80, 72% female) completed assessments including a graded exercise test measuring peak oxygen comsumption (VO2peak) to assess CRF, cognitive testing, and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the hippocampus processed with Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS). Separate linear regression models examined whether CRF was associated with hippocampal subfield volumes and whether those assocations were moderated by age or sex. Mediation models examined whether hippocampal volumes statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory performance. Covariates included age, sex, years of education, body mass index, estimated intracranial volume, and study site. RESULTS: Higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total left (B = 5.82, p = 0.039) and total right (B = 7.64, p = 0.006) hippocampal volume, as well as greater left CA2 (B = 0.14, p = 0.022) and dentate gyrus (DG; B = 2.34, p = 0.031) volume, and greater right CA1 (B = 3.99, p = 0.011), CA2 (B = 0.15, p = 0.002), and subiculum (B = 1.56, p = 0.004) volume. Sex significantly moderated left DG volume (B = -4.26, p = 0.017), such that the association was positive and significant only for males. Total left hippocampal volume [indirect effect = 0.002, 95% CI (0.0002, 0.00), p = 0.027] and right subiculum volume [indirect effect = 0.002, 95% CI (0.0007, 0.01), p = 0.006] statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory performance. DISCUSSION: While higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total hippocampal volume, CRF was not associated with all underlying subfield volumes. Our results further demonstrate the relevance of the associations between CRF and hippocampal volume for episodic memory performance. Finally, our results suggest that the regionally-specific effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease on hippocampal subfields could be mitigated by maintaining higher CRF in older adulthood.",

More research is needed to determine the relationship between age and the pathologic products associated with AD. Meanwhile, the construction of an early diagnostic model of AD, which is mainly characterized by pathological products, is very important for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. METHOD: We collected clinical study data from September 2005 to August 2024 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Using correlation analysis method like cor function, we analyzed the pathology products (t-Tau, p-Tau, and Aβ proteins), age, gender, and Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the ADNI data. Next, we investigated the relationship between pathologic products and age in the AD and non-AD groups using linear regression. Ultimately, we used these features to build a diagnostic model for AD. RESULTS: A total of 1,255 individuals were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 73.27 [7.26] years; 691male [55.1%]; 564 female [44.9%]). The results of the correlation analysis showed that the correlations between pathologic products and age were, in descending order, Tau (Corr=0.75), p-Tau (Corr=0.71), and Aβ (Corr=0.54). In the AD group, t-Tau protein showed a tendency to decrease with age, but it was not statistically significant. p-Tau protein levels similarly decreased with age and its decrease was statistically significant. In contrast to Tau protein, in the AD group, Aβ levels increased progressively with age. In the non-AD group, the trend of pathologic product levels with age was consistently opposite to that of the AD group. We finally screened the optimal AD diagnostic model (AUC=0.959) based on the results of correlation analysis and by using the Xgboost algorithm and SVM algorithm. CONCLUSION: In a novel finding, we observed that Tau protein and Aβ had opposite trends with age in both the AD and non-AD groups.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was employed to detect alterations in iron content within the olfactory bulb of the mice, while levels of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant indexes were assessed using biochemical kits. Additionally, western blotting and qPCR techniques were utilized to analyze transcriptional and expression changes in proteins and genes related to iron metabolism. Furthermore, microstructural modifications as well as mitochondrial observations were conducted through paraffin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULT: A significant and progressive increase in iron accumulation in the olfactory bulb, starting from week 8 and peaking at week 16. This accumulation coincided with a decline in olfactory function observed at week 12. Key markers of oxidative stress, such as 4-HNE and MDA, were elevated in specific layers, and antioxidant defenses were reduced. Mitochondrial damage became evident from week 8, with caspase-3 activation indicating increased apoptosis, particularly in the granular layer. This study is to demonstrate the link between chronic iron overload and progressive olfactory dysfunction in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. It provides evidence that iron-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in the olfactory bulb contribute to early sensory deficits, suggesting that the olfactory bulb's selective vulnerability can serve as an early biomarker for neurodegenerative conditions. CONCLUSION: Chronic iron overload leads to progressive oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in the olfactory bulb, causing sensory deficits. Targeting iron accumulation and oxidative damage may offer new strategies for early intervention in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the importance of addressing iron dysregulation.",

    "AbstractText": "Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is crucial for enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers (neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated tau181) and retinal biomarkers (retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer), individually and in combination, in differentiating moderate cognitive impairment and dementia from mild cognitive impairment and no cognitive impairment. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 509 participants, aged 50 and older, recruited from a memory clinic. The participants were categorized as normal (n = 100), mild cognitive impairment (n = 144), moderate cognitive impairment (n = 90) or dementia (n = 175) based on detailed clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing and MRI scans. The thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (P < 0.001) and retinal nerve fibre layer (P = 0.030) decreased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia. The thickest layers were observed in individuals with no cognitive impairment (mean ± standard deviation: ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 76 ± 11 µm, retinal nerve fibre layer: 92 ± 10 µm), while the thinnest layers were found in individuals with dementia (ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 72 ± 14 µm, retinal nerve fibre layer: 89 ± 12 µm). Plasma biomarker levels increased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia (P < 0.001). Levels were lowest in individuals with no cognitive impairment [median (interquartile range): neurofilament light chain: 15 (9) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 1.85 (1.00) pg/mL] and highest in those with dementia [neurofilament light chain: 34 (27) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 3.24 (2.81) pg/mL]. After adjusting for retinal scan signal strength, neurofilament light chain showed a stronger negative association with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness [standardized beta estimate (β) = -0.184] and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (β = -0.139) compared to phosphorylated tau181, which exhibited weaker associations with ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (β = -0.091) and retinal nerve fibre layer (β = -0.059). While retinal parameters provided modest discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.60), plasma biomarkers demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.76). Notably, neurofilament light chain had a stronger association with retinal thinning than phosphorylated tau181 and offered superior diagnostic value for identifying moderate cognitive decline. These findings underscore the potential of plasma biomarkers, particularly neurofilament light chain, for the early detection of dementia.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Clearance of beta-amyloid and tau aggregates is size dependent and altered by an inflammatory challenge.",
    "AbstractText": "Extracellular beta-amyloid aggregation and inflammation are in a complex and not fully understood interplay during hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our group has previously shown that an immune challenge with tumour necrosis factor alpha can alter extracellular beta-sheet containing aggregates in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons carrying familial Alzheimer's disease-related presenilin 1 mutations. Here, using single-molecule detection and super-resolution imaging techniques, we quantified and characterized the intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid and AT8-positive tau aggregates. Our results indicate a pre-existing Alzheimer's disease-like pathology caused by the presenilin 1 mutation, with increased beta-amyloid aggregates in both the cell lysate and conditioned media compared to isogenic controls and also increased intracellular tau aggregates. The main effect of tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment on presenilin 1 neurons was the formation of larger intracellular beta-amyloid aggregates. In contrast, isogenic controls showed more significant changes with tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment with an increase in beta-amyloid aggregates in the media but not intracellularly and an increase in tau aggregates in both the media and cell lysate, suggesting a chronic inflammation-driven mechanism for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Remarkably, we also found significant morphological differences between intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid and tau aggregates in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons, suggesting these neurons can only clear aggregates when small, and that larger aggregates stay inside the neurons. While majority of the beta-amyloid aggregates were cleared into the media, a greater portion of the tau aggregates remained intracellular. This size-dependent aggregate clearance was also shown to be conserved in vivo, using soaked and homogenized mouse and human post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain samples. As such, our results are proposing a previously unknown, size-dependent aggregate clearance mechanism, which can possibly explain the intracellular aggregation of tau and extracellular aggregation of beta-amyloid.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Site-level factors affecting nursing home implementation of a personalized music intervention: Qualitative analyses from Music & Memory: A Pragmatic Trial for Nursing Home Residents with Alzheimer's Disease (METRIcAL).",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) are preferred alternatives to using antipsychotic medications to manage disruptive behaviors in nursing home (NH) residents living with dementia. However, the implementation of these interventions is often complex in the NH environment. In this qualitative analysis of data from an embedded pragmatic clinical trial (ePCT) of a personalized music intervention, we describe NH-level implementation barriers and facilitators. METHODS: In a 54-facility trial, we randomized 27 NHs from four US corporations to the personalized music intervention. In this qualitative analysis, we analyzed barriers and facilitators at 9 of the 27 intervention NHs, using (1) routinely collected data collector observations and (2) semi-structured interviews with NH staff. We iteratively developed codes to best describe these data and generated themes. RESULTS: We found five qualitative themes related to the variation of intervention implementation across NHs: (1) turnover and institutional changes interfered with implementation; (2) consistent with pragmatic implementation, delivery strategies varied across NHs; (3) family members influenced residents' participation; (4) non-clinical program champions needed clinical buy-in, which was challenging and required demonstrating the intervention's clinical benefits; and (5) technological barriers among staff and residents impeded implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative results from nine facilities participating in a NH ePCT of personalized music intervention highlight the importance of identifying an intervention's key components to ensure fidelity, while allowing the flexibility necessary for pragmatic implementation. Engaging family caregivers may improve the implementation of NPIs in the NH setting. Results may be helpful to other researchers implementing NPIs to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms for people living with dementia in NHs. HIGHLIGHTS: This was a real-world trial of a personalized music for nursing home (NH) residents with dementia.Pragmatic adaptations to intervention delivery may have compromised fidelity.Family caregivers are important to the success of behavioral interventions in NHs.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, often showing neuropathological indicators by age 40. Physical function and activities of daily living (ADLs) are understudied areas of function that may inform dementia risk. We investigated associations among age, physical function (gait/balance, grip strength, and lower extremity strength), ADLs, and dementia risk symptoms in adults with DS. We hypothesized that compromised physical function and lower independence with ADLs would be associated with an informant/caregiver-reported measure of dementia risk symptoms. METHODS: A secondary analysis for this cross-sectional study was completed using data from two academic research centers with 43 adults with DS (age 30 ± 12 years). We examined the association of dementia risk symptoms, captured through the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID), with physical function (timed up and go [TUG], sit-to-stand [STS], grip strength) and ADLs (Waisman Activities of Daily Living Scale). A linear regression model for the continuous dementia risk measure in the DSQIID used a log transformation of (1 + log(Y + 1)) to account for a high zero count. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess differences in the physical function measures, DSQIID questionnaire, and Waisman ADL by dividing mean age categories. RESULTS: Higher DSQIID scores were associated with lower independence with ADLs (β = -0.103, p = 0.008), slower gait times (TUG; β = 0.112, p = 0.034), and impaired lower extremity strength (STS; β = 0.112, p = 0.017) and grip strength (β = -0.039, p = 0.034). DSQIID scores differed significantly between the ≥30 and <30 age groups. Participants ≥30 years of age scored 5 points higher on the DSQIID than participants <30, suggesting that age was associated with greater dementia risk. DISCUSSION: Greater dementia risk symptoms were associated with age, lower physical function scores, and independence with ADLs, suggesting that declines in physical function and ADLs may be early indicators of subsequent dementia risk in adults with DS. HIGHLIGHTS: We explored the association of physical function and activities of daily living (ADLs) in aging adults with DS and their relationship with informant/caregiver report of dementia risk symptoms.Our findings demonstrated a significant relationship between a higher number of dementia risk symptoms observed and lower independence with ADLs, and impaired gait/balance, grip strength, and lower extremity strength.Further research with larger longitudinal studies is necessary to investigate any causative relationships among physical function, ADL function, and dementia risk symptoms.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Impacts of informant replacement in two industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, participants must enroll with a study partner informant who completes validated study instruments. We hypothesized that mid-trial informant replacement impacts study data in industry-sponsored trials. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of two industry-sponsored AD clinical trials testing semagacestat in mild-to-moderate AD dementia. We assessed the relationships between informant replacement and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scores. Using generalized estimating equations, we assessed bias and variability using mean (bias) and mean absolute (variance) change in ADCS-ADL between successive visits as outcomes. Both models adjusted for a priori-specified potential confounding variables including participant sex, age, informant type, trial, time, previous ADCS-ADL score, and region. To analyze the impact on end-of-study change-from-baseline results, we used an analysis of covariance model to estimate the association between replacement and end-of-study change-from-baseline in ADCS-ADL, in which we adjusted for participant sex, age, informant type, trial, baseline measurement, and region. We conducted an F-test to compare the variances of this change. RESULTS: Among N = 2637 randomized participants, 69 participants (2.6%) experienced 78 occurrences of replacement. For visits standardized to be 3 months apart, the difference in mean between-visit change in ADCS-ADL was approximately -1.61 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.79, 0.57; P = 0.147), comparing participants who experienced replacement to similar participants who had stable informants. The difference in the mean between-visit absolute change was approximately 2.02 points (95% CI: 0.34, 3.70; P = 0.019). We did not estimate a statistically significant difference in end-of-study change-from-baseline (Est. = -0.70 points; 95% CI: -5.88, 4.48; P = 0.790) or a significant ratio of variances (Est. = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.67, 2.28; P = 0.600) for participants with replacement compared to those with stable informants.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The aggregation and spread of hyperphosphorylated, pathological tau in the human brain is hypothesized to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as other neurogenerative tauopathies. O-GlcNAcylation, an important post-translational modification of tau and many other proteins, is significantly decreased in brain tissue of AD patients relative to healthy controls. Increased tau O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to reduce tau pathology in mouse in vivo tauopathy models. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from tau thereby driving interest in OGA inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to reduce tau pathology and slow the progression of AD. METHODS: A multidisciplinary approach was used to identify ceperognastat (LY3372689) as a potent OGA inhibitor, including an extensive discovery effort with synthetic chemistry, structure-based drug design, and in vivo OGA enzyme occupancy studies. Preclinical studies assessed the target engagement, inhibition of OGA enzyme activity, OGA enzyme occupancy, and changes in tau O-GlcNAc. Four clinical Phase 1 studies of ceperognastat in healthy participants were performed to assess clinical safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and enzyme occupancy. RESULTS: Ceperognastat is a potent, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant, low-dose inhibitor of OGA, which can achieve > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in animal and human brain. Overall, ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile in Phase 1 clinical studies with no serious adverse events reported following single and multiple dosing. The PK, enzyme occupancy, and safety profile supported Phase 2 development of ceperognastat. DISCUSSION: Ceperognastat is an orally available, highly potent, CNS-penetrant OGA inhibitor that achieved high (> 80%) OGA enzyme occupancy and increased brain O-GlcNAc-tau preclinically. Ceperognastat demonstrated > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in Phase 1 trials. These occupancy data informed the dose selection for the Phase 2 clinical program. HIGHLIGHTS: Ceperognastat is a highly potent, CNS-penetrant OGA inhibitor.Ceperognastat is both orally available and CNS-penetrant even when given at low doses.Ceperognastat can achieve > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in the animal and human brain.Ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile in Phase 1 clinical studies.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have examined the predictive accuracy of plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers in clinical cohorts. However, their accuracy for predicting amyloid-positive patients in community-based cohorts is unclear. This study aimed to determine the predictive accuracy of Aβ precursor protein 669-711/Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40/1-42 and their composite biomarkers for brain amyloid deposition or the clinical progression in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted from August 2015 to September 2019. Subsequently, the participants underwent follow-up cognitive assessments up to 8 years after the start of the study. Blood samples were collected from older adults aged ≥ 65 years with MCI at baseline. Plasma Aβ biomarkers were analyzed using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. The accuracy of plasma biomarkers for brain amyloid status was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Relationships between comorbidities and plasma Aβ markers were examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Associations of plasma biomarkers with clinical conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia were evaluated using Kaplan‒Meier curves. RESULTS: The participants included 107 patients (57 [53.3%] females, median age: 76.0 [72.0-80.0] years). Plasma biomarkers correlated with cortical amyloid uptake (ρ = 0.667-0.754). The composite biomarker had the best area under the curve (0.943, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.901 to 0.985) for predicting amyloid positivity. Apolipoprotein ε4 status showed significant correlations with increased plasma amyloid biomarker levels. Participants with high composite biomarker levels at baseline had a greater risk of conversion to AD dementia (hazard ratio 10.74, 95% CI: 3.51 to 32.84, P < 0.001). The higher composite biomarker was associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline (ρ = -0.575, P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Plasma Aβ composite biomarker may serve as a surrogate measure for amyloid deposition and a predictor of disease progression in a community-based cohort. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers correlated with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B uptake, mainly in the frontal/parietotemporal cortices and posterior cingulate gyrus.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict amyloid positron emission tomography positivity with a high area under the curve of 0.943 in a community-based mild cognitive impairment cohort.The higher amyloid composite biomarker at baseline was significantly associated with worsening Mini-Mental State Examination score and a high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia over 8 years.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict clinical progression to AD dementia with a high area under the curve of 0.860.Apolipoprotein E ε4 status influenced the plasma Aβ biomarker levels.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Without disease-modifying interventions, Medicare and Medicaid spending on Alzheimer's disease (AD) management is expected to reach 637 billion USD annually by 2050. The recent advent of promising AD therapies after decades of a near-total failure rate in clinical trials suggests that more disease-modifying therapies are on the horizon. In this review, we assess the late-stage pipeline of disease-modifying candidates for AD and offer a novel classification of intervention candidates by treatment paradigms-groups of candidates that share an underlying biological mechanism of action and general disease target. METHODS: We extracted data from the National Library of Medicine clinical trials database regarding Phase 2 and 3 trials of disease-modifying AD therapies. We categorized trials into eight unique treatment paradigms, which we defined by combinations of therapy (biologic, small molecule, cell and gene therapy, other) and target (amyloid, tau, other). We analyzed primary endpoints, eligibility criteria including clinical ratings of cognition, trial phase and length, and funding sources. RESULTS: We identified 123 unique disease-modifying intervention candidates in 175 late-stage clinical trials. Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% and 54% of trials, respectively. Eligibility criteria favored patients between the ages of 60 and 80 years with mild cognitive impairment. Including multi-phase trials, 81% of studies were engaged in Phase 2 and 27% in Phase 3. Notably, within the Biologic-Amyloid paradigm, 64% of trials were engaged in Phase 3. DISCUSSION: Current studies of disease-modifying therapies for AD comprise a diverse set of approaches to treating the disease. However, effort is largely concentrated in a few treatment paradigms and a narrow patient population, causing varying rates of progress among treatment paradigms in the late-stage clinical trial pipeline. Strategies may be warranted to accelerate successes in the most promising therapeutical paradigms and nurture growth within nascent areas lacking resources but not potential. HIGHLIGHTS: An analysis of Alzheimer's disease trial treatment paradigms was conducted.From April 2021 to March 2023, 175 trials of 123 unique candidates were reviewed.Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% and 54% of trials, respectively.Eligibility criteria favored ages 60 through 80 with mild cognitive impairment.",

METHODS: HRQoL was characterized overall, by sex and subtype in PPA (n = 118) using the Health Utilities Index-2/3 (HUI2/3). Multiple linear regression assessed associations between HRQoL and language severity. RESULTS: Multi-attribute HUI2/3 summary scores indicated moderate to severe impairment. Scores did not differ by sex and were more severe for semantic than non-semantic PPA. Language severity scores showed significant associations with HUI multi-attribute scores and select single-attribute measures (hearing, sensation, cognition, and speech) with less language impairment associated with better functional capacity related to HRQoL. DISCUSSION: This study identified poor HRQoL in a relatively large PPA cohort. HRQoL measures aid in determining patient perspective, policy decision making, and resource allocation. Results may be used to advocate for PPA support.

Their work is stressful, but until recently, no measures were available to assess stress in this workforce. Using the new Long-Term Care Cope (LTC COPE) scale, this study evaluates the relationship of coping with staff demographic characteristics and outcomes; the findings can be used to develop and evaluate interventions to improve staff well-being. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional online questionnaire completed by professional caregivers working in a purposive selection of 10 NHs and three AL communities in California, New York, and North Carolina. The sample included 391 professional caregivers and had a representative distribution by age; it was 87% female; 42% non-Hispanic/Latinx (NHL) Black, 25% NHL White, 20% Hispanic/Latinx, and 7% NHL Asian. Worker job satisfaction, mental health, and health-related quality of life were examined in relation to caregiver demographics and the following approaches to coping as measured by the LTC COPE: avoidance, adaptive psychological strategies, active engagement, maladaptive psychological strategies, minimizing emotional impact, and substance use. Statistical comparisons used non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Little difference in coping strategies was noted by sex and education; older caregivers used adaptive psychological strategies more than younger caregivers; and traditionally minoritized adults (NHL Black, NHL Asian, and Hispanic/Latinx), compared to NHL White adults, more often used adaptive and less often used maladaptive psychological coping strategies. The use of maladaptive and avoidance strategies was strongly associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout. DISCUSSION: Professional caregivers report using a wide variety of coping strategies, with multiple strategies being the norm, and both adaptive/engaged and maladaptive/disengaged approaches are common. Certain coping approaches are strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and burnout; attention to training and support of adaptive and positive coping may augment other efforts to improve job satisfaction and performance. The LTC COPE scale has the potential to guide and evaluate practices to improve workers' well-being.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Choline alfoscerate, a cholinergic precursor, is widely used in Korea for dementia-related symptoms and is covered by national health insurance (NHI). This study investigates the utilization trends and factors influencing choline alfoscerate prescription in newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using real-world data. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) for patients aged 60 years and older who were newly diagnosed with AD between 2012 and 2019. Patients with prescriptions for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) or memantine within 60 days of diagnosis were included. Choline alfoscerate utilization was defined as prescriptions within 60 days of initial diagnosis. Factors influencing its use were identified through multiple logistic regression analyses, and trends over time were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage Trend test. RESULTS: Among the 330,326 study participants, 99,845 (33.08%) were prescribed choline alfoscerate, with usage increasing from 15.96% in 2012 to 47.65% in 2019. Factors positively associated with its use included male sex, MedAid insurance, and osteoarthritis. Conversely, usage decreased with comorbidities such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, and depression. CONCLUSION: Choline alfoscerate usage in Korea has significantly increased, partly due to its national insurance coverage and the absence of disease-modifying therapies for AD. Given the uncertain efficacy and potential risks of choline alfoscerate, continuous monitoring and rigorous evaluation of its long-term benefits and safety are essential. Further research is necessary to establish definitive evidence for its effectiveness and guide its therapeutic use in AD management. HIGHLIGHTS: Choline alfoscerate usage among newly diagnosed AD patients in Korea increased from 15.96% in 2012 to 47.65% in 2019.Male sex (OR = 1.05) and MedAid insurance coverage (OR = 1.07) were associated with higher odds of choline alfoscerate usage.Usage was more likely in patients with osteoarthritis (OR = 1.05) and less likely among those with hypertension (OR = 0.96), stroke/TIA (OR = 0.80), chronic kidney disease (OR = 0.80), and depression (OR = 0.93).Patients in rural areas had higher odds of using choline alfoscerate (OR = 1.28) compared to those in metropolitan areas (OR = 1.00).Despite limited evidence of efficacy, the extensive use of choline alfoscerate highlights the need for continuous monitoring and rigorous evaluation to ensure its safety and therapeutic value in AD management.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is partially characterized by the progressive accumulation of aggregated tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Although the association between accumulated tau, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline is critical for disease understanding and clinical trial design, we still lack robust tools to predict individualized trajectories of tau accumulation. Our objective was to assess whether brain imaging biomarkers of flortaucipir-positron emission tomography (PET), in combination with clinical and genomic measures, could predict future pathological tau accumulation. METHODS: We quantified the disease profile of participants (N = 276) using a comprehensive set of descriptors, including clinical/demographic (age, diagnosis, amyloid status, sex, race, ethnicity), genetic (apolipoprotein E [APOE]-ε4), and flortaucipir-PET imaging measures (regional flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr] and comprehensive radiomic texture features extracted from Automated Anatomical Labeling template regions). We trained an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm in a 2:1 split train-test configuration to derive a prognostic index that (i) stratifies individualized brain regions including global (AD-signature region) and lobar regions (frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal) into stable/slow- and fast-progressors based on future tau accumulation, and (ii) forecasts individualized regional annualized-rate-of-change in flortaucipir-PET SUVr. Further, we developed an adaptive model incorporating flortaucipir-PET measurements from the baseline and intermediate timepoints to predict annualized-rate-of-change. RESULTS: In binary classification for predicting stable/slow- versus fast-progressors, the area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve was 0.86 in the AD-signature region and 0.83, 0.82, 0.84, and 0.83 in frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions, respectively. The trained models successfully predicted annualized-rate-of-change of flortaucipir-PET regional flortaucipir SUVr in AD-signature and lobar regions (Pearson-correlation [R]: AD-signature = 0.73; frontal = 0.73; occipital = 0.71; parietal = 0.70; temporal = 0.69). The models' performance in predicting annualized-rate-of-change slightly increased when imaging features from intermediate timepoints were used in the adaptive setting (R: AD-signature = 0.79; frontal = 0.87; occipital = 0.83; parietal = 0.74; temporal = 0.82). DISCUSSION: Taken together, our results propose a robust approach to predict future tau accumulation that may improve the ability to enroll, stratify, and gauge efficacy in clinical trial participants.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Up to 20% of older adults in the United States have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and about one-third of people with MCI are predicted to transition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 5 years. Standard cognitive assessments are long and require a trained technician to administer. We developed the first computerized adaptive test (CAT) based on multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) to more precisely, rapidly, and repeatedly assesses cognitive abilities across the adult lifespan. We present results for a prototype CAT (pCAT-COG) for assessment of global cognitive function. METHODS: We sampled items across five cognitive domains central to neuropsychological testing (episodic memory [EM], semantic memory/language [SM], working memory [WM], executive function/flexible thinking, and processing speed [PS]). The item bank consists of 54 items, with 9 items of varying difficulty drawn from six different cognitive tasks. Each of the 54 items has 3 response trials, yielding an ordinal score (0-3 trials correct). We also include three long-term memory items not designed for adaptive administration, for a total bank of 57 items. Calibration data were collected in-person and online, calibrated using a bifactor MIRT model, and pCAT-COG scores validated against a technician-administered neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: The bifactor MIRT model improved fit over a unidimensional IRT model (p < 0.0001). The global pCAT-COG scores were inversely correlated with age (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001). Simulated adaptive administration of 11 items maintained a correlation of r = 0.94 with the total item bank scores. Significant differences between mild and no cognitive impairment (NCI) were found (effect size of 1.08 SD units). The pCAT-COG correlated with clinician-based global measure (r = 0.64). DISCUSSION: MIRT-based CAT is feasible and valid for the assessment of global cognitive impairment, laying the foundation for the development of a full CAT-COG that will draw from a much larger item bank with both global and domain specific measures of cognitive impairment. HIGHLIGHTS: As Americans age, numbers at risk for developing cognitive impairment are increasing.Aging-related declines in cognition begins decades prior to the onset of obvious cognitive impairment.Traditional assessment is burdensome and requires trained clinicians.We developed an adaptive testing framework using multidimensional item response theory.It is comparable to lengthier in-person assessments that require trained psychometrists.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The HOPE4MCI study: AGB101 treatment slows progression of entorhinal cortex atrophy in APOE ε4 non-carriers with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal hyperactivity is a hallmark of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) that predicts progression in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). AGB101 is an extended-release formulation of levetiracetam in the dose range previously demonstrated to normalize hippocampal activity and improve cognitive performance in aMCI. The HOPE4MCI study was a 78-week trial to assess the progression of MCI due to AD. As reported in Mohs et al., the decline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score (CDR-SB) was reduced by 40% in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 non-carriers over the 78-week duration of the study with a negligible effect in carriers. Here we report an exploratory analysis of the effects of AGB101 on neuroimaging and biomarker measures in the 44 APOE ε4 non-carriers who completed the 78-week protocol. METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at baseline and after 78 weeks were analyzed using the Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields software providing volume measures of key structures of the medial temporal lobe relevant to AD progression. Blood samples collected at 78 weeks in the study were analyzed for plasma biomarkers. RESULTS: Treatment with AGB101 significantly reduced atrophy of the left entorhinal cortex (ERC) compared to placebo. This reduction in atrophy was correlated with less decline in the CDR-SB score over 78 weeks and with lower neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration. DISCUSSION: The HOPE4MCI study showed that APOE ε4 non-carriers treated with AGB101 demonstrated a substantially more favorable treatment effect compared to carriers. Here we report that treatment with AGB101 in non-carriers of APOE ε4 significantly reduced atrophy of the left ERC over 78 weeks. That reduction in atrophy was closely coupled with the change in CDR-SB and with plasma NfL indicative of neurodegeneration in the brain. These exploratory analyses are consistent with a reduction in neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 non-carriers treated with AGB101 before a clinical diagnosis of dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: AGB101 slows entorhinal cortex (ERC) atrophy in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 non-carriers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated with less Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes decline.Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated with lower neurofilament light chain.AGB101 treatment reduces neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 non-carriers with MCI due to AD.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Relationship between physical activity and biomarkers of pathology and neuroinflammation in preclinical autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) has been linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. However, less is known about its effects in the AD preclinical stage. We aimed to investigate whether greater PA was associated with lower plasma biomarkers of AD pathology, neural injury, reactive astrocytes, and better cognition in individuals with autosomal-dominant AD due to the presenilin-1 E280A mutation who are virtually guaranteed to develop dementia. METHODS: Twenty-eight cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers (ages x̄ = 29.28) wore a FitBit Charge-4 for 14 days. We calculated their average steps to measure locomotion, and Training Impulse (TRIMP) to quantify the intensity and duration of PAs using heart rate. Plasma amyloid beta 42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 181, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured. Cognition was assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word list learning and delayed recall, Trail Making Test Part A, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-version IV Digit Span Backward. We conducted multiple linear regressions controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and education. RESULTS: There were no associations among steps or TRIMP with plasma biomarkers or cognition. Greater TRIMP was related to higher GFAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: PA was not associated with cognition or plasma biomarkers. However, greater intensity and duration of PAs were related to higher GFAP. Participants engaged very little in moderate to vigorous PA. Therefore, light PA may not exert a significant protective effect in preclinical AD. Future work with larger samples and longitudinal data is needed to elucidate further the potential impact of PA on AD progression in the preclinical stages. HIGHLIGHTS: Locomotion (average steps) was not associated with plasma biomarkers or cognition.Greater training load (training impulse) was related to higher glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in mutation carriers.Light physical activity may not suffice to exert a protective effect on Alzheimer's disease.",

Recent clinical trial readouts implicate a variety of non-amyloid/non-tau (NANT) approaches that show promise in slowing cognitive decline for people with AD. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) meeting held on December 13-14, 2022, reviewed the current state of NANT targets on underlying AD pathophysiology and their contribution to cognitive decline, the current data on a diverse range of NANT biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and the integration of NANT concepts in clinical trial designs. Participants also discussed the current definition of therapies that target underlying AD pathophysiology, what endpoints best define what is considered a meaningful change beyond the current approved definition for clinical efficacy, and how the recent NANT findings should inform the development of future guidelines for AD classification and personalized treatment strategies. HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from industry, academia, and government to review the current state of non-beta amyloid and non-tau (NANT) targets on underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology.The totality of scientific and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that emerging NANT targets play a role in cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD.

Although recent FDA-approved amyloid plaque-lowering monoclonal antibody therapies have shifted the trajectory of AD, additional treatment options will be key to further slowing clinical decline or stopping disease progression. Thus, new and emerging therapies for AD have created an evolving therapeutic landscape. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) Spring meeting held on May 23-34, 2023, brought together a broad array of scientific leaders from the AARR membership, academia, industry, and government and regulatory agencies to discuss the future of clinical trials in an era of regulator-approved amyloid-targeting therapies. Participants discussed lessons learned from other neurological diseases where disease-modifying treatments were first approved and key considerations for future clinical trials, for example, trial population real-world representativeness, duration, biomarker screening, efficacy endpoints, combination therapy, as well as overall trial design and the ethical and equity concerns that clinicians, patients, and their families face when considering clinical trial participation.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The Información de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer para Latinos (IDEAL) Study is a randomized clinical trial investigating the psychosocial, behavioral, and cognitive impacts of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype disclosure for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) among Latinos. METHODS: We used address-based sampling to recruit English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos aged 40-64 living in northern Manhattan for a community-based Baseline Survey about their knowledge and opinions about AD. Participants eligible for the clinical trial were invited to complete an Introductory Session, including AD and genetics education and informed consent, before undergoing genotyping for APOE. Participants were then randomized to learn their risk of AD by age 85 (range: 21%-55%) based on either Latino ethnicity and family history alone, or the same factors and their APOE genotype. Risk information is provided in a semi-structured genetic counseling session. Psychological impacts, health-related behavioral changes, and cognitive performance are evaluated 6 weeks, 9 months, and 15 months later via surveys and qualitative interviews. To promote cultural competence, study materials were developed by a multidisciplinary team including bilingual and bicultural staff, Latinx content experts, and genetic counselors. RESULTS: We sent invitations to 91,433 households; 5542 (6.1%) responded, 2120 completed the Baseline Survey (78.5% online; 21.5% via computer-assisted telephone interview), and 2087 were deemed eligible, yielding a response rate of 2.3%. Many participants expressed appreciation for the opportunity to contribute to AD research. We randomized 374 participants for the clinical trial. DISCUSSION: We describe the study design, recruitment and retention strategies, and interventions employed in the IDEAL Study. Our design provides a framework for future studies using rigorous mixed methods.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To report the development and performance of 2 distinct deep learning models trained exclusively on retinal color fundus photographs to classify Alzheimer disease (AD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two independent datasets (UK Biobank and our tertiary academic institution) of good-quality retinal photographs derived from patients with AD and controls were used to build 2 deep learning models, between April 1, 2021, and January 30, 2024. ADVAS is a U-Net-based architecture that uses retinal vessel segmentation. ADRET is a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers style self-supervised learning convolutional neural network pretrained on a large data set of retinal color photographs from UK Biobank. The models' performance to distinguish AD from non-AD was determined using mean accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiving operating curves. The generated attention heatmaps were analyzed for distinctive features. RESULTS: The self-supervised ADRET model had superior accuracy when compared with ADVAS, in both UK Biobank (98.27% vs 77.20%; P<.001) and our institutional testing data sets (98.90% vs 94.17%; P=.04). No major differences were noted between the original and binary vessel segmentation and between both eyes vs single-eye models. Attention heatmaps obtained from patients with AD highlighted regions surrounding small vascular branches as areas of highest relevance to the model decision making. CONCLUSION: A bidirectional encoder representations from transformers style self-supervised convolutional neural network pretrained on a large data set of retinal color photographs alone can screen symptomatic AD with high accuracy, better than U-Net-pretrained models. To be translated in clinical practice, this methodology requires further validation in larger and diverse populations and integrated techniques to harmonize fundus photographs and attenuate the imaging-associated noise.",

The objective of this study is to identify the association between ACP codes and healthcare utilization in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: This is a multicenter cohort study using real-world electronic health data. Using the TriNetX database, we collected electronic health data from 92 institutions in the United States. We included patients aged 65 and older who had been diagnosed with one of four neurological diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patients with congestive heart failure were included as a reference. From the 64,683,009 total patients in the database, 877,138 had Alzheimer's disease, 544,610 had Parkinson's disease, 208,341 had multiple sclerosis, 9,944 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 1,500,186 had congestive heart failure. For each disease, we compared hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits over a two-year period between patients with and without ACP codes documented. Then, in patients with ACP, we investigated the rates of hospitalizations and ED visits over the two years before ACP and two years after ACP to understand the impact of ACP on the healthcare utilization trend. All patients had records for at least two years after index. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The rate of ACP code documentation ranged from 1.8% of multiple sclerosis patients to 3.6% of Alzheimer's disease patients. After matching for demographic and health variables, usage of ACP codes was associated with significantly fewer hospitalizations for Alzheimer's disease patients. Across all diseases, there was a 20% to 30% decrease in ED visits, which was significant. Furthermore, there was a significant change in the trend of hospitalizations and ED visits for patients after ACP documentation. Patients went from increasing utilization before ACP documentation to decreasing utilization after documentation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ACP billing codes are used infrequently in neurological disease, which may indicate that reimbursement alone is not sufficient to drive code usage. Usage of ACP billing codes was associated with decreased healthcare utilization, particularly in terms of ED visits. Beyond the primary objective of providing goal-concordant care, ACP may impact the economic burden of chronic neurodegenerative disease, which has high costs of care in our aging society. There may be particular benefits with Alzheimer's disease, which had an impact on both hospitalizations and ED visits and is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Future work is needed to better understand the best implementation strategy for ACP in a multifaceted approach that emphasizes patient care preferences for their illness.",

VaD is characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss that may progress due to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) a hallmark of AD. CAA triggers the progression of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes with the subsequent the development of VaD and mixed dementia. Early diagnosis of patients with appropriate use of anti-inflammatory can prevent CAA-related inflammation and VaD development. Currently, there are no effective drugs in the management of VaD. Of note, cholesterol-lowering agent statins which are commonly used in patients with vascular diseases and dyslipidemia may affect the progression of VaD. Many previous studies highlighted the potential therapeutic efficacy of statins in treating VaD. Though, the underlying mechanisms of statins in prevention and treatment of VaD are not fully clarified. Consequently, this review aims to discuss the mechanistic role of statins in the management of VaD, and how statins may adversely affect the cognitive function in VaD patients.",

METHOD: We searched five databases from inception to July 2023 for peer-reviewed publications reporting suicidal ideation, suicide attempt or death by suicide for at least two dementia subtypes. Meta-analyses compared suicidality between subtypes of dementia with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). RESULTS: From 4983 studies identified, 12 met inclusion criteria. Pooling data, people with Vascular Dementia were significantly more likely to experience suicidal ideation (OR= 2.02 [95 % CI= 1.06;3.8]) and attempt suicide (OR=1.94 [95 % CI= 1.28;2.94]) than people with AD, but not die by suicide (OR= 1.05 [95 % CI= 0.69;1.59]).

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether later-life changes in subjective cognition and behavior - potential markers of Alzheimer disease - could be observed in cognitively unimpaired older persons with a history of suspected mild traumatic brain injury (smTBI) earlier in life and whether changes in cognition and behavior mediated the link between smTBI and daily function. METHODS: Data for 1392 participants from the Canadian Platform for Research Online to Investigate Health, Quality of Life, Cognition, Behaviour, Function, and Caregiving in Aging were analyzed. A validated self-reported brain injury screening questionnaire was used to determine the history of smTBI. Outcomes were measured using the Everyday Cognition scale (for subjective cognitive decline [SCD]), Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI) Checklist, and Standard Assessment of Global Everyday Activities (for function). Inverse probability of treatment weighted logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to model smTBI (exposure) associations with SCD and MBI statuses, and Everyday Cognition-II and MBI Checklist total scores, respectively. Mediation analyses were conducted using bootstrapping. RESULTS: History of smTBI was linked to higher odds of SCD (odds ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence interval: [1.14-1.84]) or MBI (odds ratio = 1.75, 95% confidence interval: [1.54-1.98]), as well as 24% (95% confidence interval: [18%-31%]) higher Everyday Cognition-II and 52% (95% confidence interval: [41%-63%]) higher MBI Checklist total scores. Finally, SCD and MBI mediated approximately 45% and 56%, respectively, of the association between smTBI history and poorer function, as indicated by higher Standard Assessment of Global Everyday Activities total scores. CONCLUSIONS: smTBI at any point in the life course is linked to poorer cognition and behavior even in community-dwelling older persons without MCI or dementia. Older persons with smTBI may benefit from early dementia risk assessment using tools that measure changes in cognition and behavior. Interventions for declining cognition and behavior may also be beneficial in this population to address functional impairment.",

This study maps the 10/66 algorithm for dementia classification, widely used and validated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), to the U.S. Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), the dementia sub-study of the Health and Retirement Study, and assesses its performance in ADAMS. We identified the subset of 10/66 algorithm items comparably measured in ADAMS, then used these items to re-train the 10/66 algorithm against the ADAMS clinical dementia diagnosis, employing k-fold cross-validation to assess performance. We compared the modified 10/66 algorithm to four other dementia classification algorithms previously validated in ADAMS, both for overall dementia estimation as well as for estimating education gradients. The modified 10/66 algorithm had higher sensitivity (87%) and specificity (93%) than the comparison algorithms. All of the algorithms over-estimated the education gradient in dementia, although the modest ADAMS sample size precludes precise comparisons of education gradient accuracy. Overall, we found that the modified 10/66 algorithm performs well in classifying dementia status in the U.S. Our results support the validity of risk factor comparisons between U.S. and 10/66 LMIC dementia datasets.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Nepal, like other low- and middle-income countries, is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older adults and the rate of aging in the population. This has increased the number of older adults with age-associated chronic illnesses, which in turn will escalate the demand for specialized healthcare and long-term care in Nepal. However, very little is known regarding the current healthcare system and health policies for older adults in Nepal. In this paper, we aimed to advance this understanding. METHODS: We reviewed the existing literature on the health, healthcare system, and policies related to older adults in Nepal. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that older adults have a high prevalence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and chronic kidney diseases, and the number of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is on the rise. Additionally, there is a decline in historical family caregiving for several reasons such as international migration of offspring, and the country currently lacks a skilled geriatric workforce and formal long-term care support and services (LTSS). Together, this has created a challenge in adequately meeting the health and care needs of the older population. Findings also indicated that several geriatric health policies exist in the country, which ensure primarily free healthcare services for older adults. However, economic constraints limit the financial resources to implement these policies, build appropriate care facilities, and improve access and utilization. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the government must develop sustainable financing to adequately provide quality healthcare and LTSS for older adults as the population ages.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Previous research has suggested a link between the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and metabolic disorder; however, the findings have been inconsistent. To date, the majority of metabolomics studies have focused on AD, resulting in a relative paucity of research on early-stage conditions such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underexplored. In this study, we employed a comprehensive platform for the early screening of individuals with MCI using high-throughput targeted metabolomics. METHOD: We included 171 participants including 124 individuals with MCI and 47 healthy subjects. Univariate statistical analysis was conducted using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with p-values corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The screening criteria were set at FDR < 0.05 and fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 0.67. Multivariate analysis was performed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), where differential metabolites were identified based on variable influence on projection (VIP) scores (VIP > 1 and FDR < 0.05). Random forest analysis was used to further evaluate the ability of the metabolic data to distinguish effectively between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 14 differential metabolites were identified, leading to the discovery of a biomarker panel consisting of three plasma metabolites including uric acid, pyruvic acid and isolithocholic acid that effectively distinguished MCI patients from healthy subjects. DISCUSSION: These findings have provided a comprehensive metabolic profile, offering valuable insights into the early prediction and understanding of the pathogenic processes underlying MCI. This study holds the potential for advancing early detection and intervention strategies for MCI.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Modifying reaction time tasks parameters in the automated IntelliCage identifies heightened impulsivity and impaired attention in the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The 3xTg-AD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important tool to investigate the relationship between development of pathological amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Traditional behavioral tasks assessing aspects of learning and memory, such as mazes requiring spatial navigation, unfortunately suffer from several shortcomings, including the stress of human handling and not probing species-typical behavior. The automated IntelliCage system was developed to circumvent such issues by testing mice in a social environment while measuring multiple aspects of cognition. Water consumption can serve as a primary motivator for task engagement. Once animals adapt to the cage and can access water, mice can be subjected to operant tasks. Each of the four corners of a cage contains doors to manipulate access to water, visual LED cues, and a valve allowing administration of an air puff. Previously, we detected significant impairments in 3xTg-AD mice in the IntelliCage, however a high failure rate and genotypical differences in water motivation were observed. METHODS: Here, we implemented an IntelliCage paradigm where mice underwent progressively more difficult reaction time tasks to assess attention and impulsivity, behaviors mediated by the prefrontal cortex. Mice were placed in the IntelliCage at 11.5 months of age, which corresponds with the presence of widespread pathology. RESULTS: As the difficulty of the reaction time tasks increased, 3xTg-AD mice exhibited lower percent Correct Responses than NonTg. When implementing varying pre-cue durations, where animals are required to wait between the initiation of the trial and the LED turning on (which then requires a nose-poke to access water), 3xTg-AD mice prematurely nose-poked on trials requiring a longer delay before a second nose poke would allow water access, demonstrating heightened impulsivity. The presence of soluble and insoluble fractions of cortical Aβ40 and 42, and phosphorylated tau epitopes threonine 181 and serine 396 confirmed the presence of neuropathological hallmarks in 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSION: Together, this study describes a novel protocol that overcomes motivational differences and detects attention and impulsivity deficits in 3xTg-AD mice utilizing the IntelliCage.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Apolipoprotein E dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: a study on miRNA regulation, glial markers, and amyloid pathology.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis, predominantly expressed in astrocytes and to a lesser extent in microglia within the central nervous system (CNS). While the APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), its precise role in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Apoe-knockout (Apoe-ko) mice, mice expressing human APOE4, and human APOE4 carriers exhibit similar deficits in lipid metabolism, cognitive and behavioral functions, and neurodegeneration. The retina, as part of the CNS, has been studied to investigate the underlying mechanisms of AD, including neuroinflammation, amyloid aggregation, and neurodegeneration. This study explores ApoE's role in AD by analyzing brain and eye samples from Apoe-ko mice, focusing on identifying potential retinal biomarkers associated with ApoE dysfunction. METHODS: We compared female Apoe-ko mice on a regular diet to age-matched C57BL/6J controls at 3 and 9 months. Our investigations included microRNAs (miRNAs), their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and selected protein markers, including astroglial (Gfap), microglial/macrophage (Iba1 and Trem2) markers, and amyloid precursor protein (APP)/amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides implicated in AD pathogenesis. We also examined female Apoe-ko mice on a high-fat diet versus a regular diet at 9 months for differential miRNA and mRNA expressions. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that miRNA levels were generally lower in 3-month-old Apoe-ko mice but increased in 9-month-old mice across five distinct brain regions, as well as in eye tissue and tear fluid. A high-fat diet further enhanced miRNA dysregulation in brain and eye tissues, but not in tear fluid. Target mRNAs were generally higher in the neocortex-hippocampus and eye tissue of 3-month-old Apoe-ko mice but decreased with age, except for glial cell mRNAs like Gfap and Aif1. Protein analysis revealed elevated Gfap expression, and increased APP/Aβ peptide accumulation in the neocortex-hippocampus, including brain endothelial cells at the meninges, as well as in the retina of 9-month-old Apoe-ko mice. These findings highlight ApoE's pivotal role in AD, demonstrating its impact on inflammatory and amyloidogenic/angiogenic miRNA expression, glial homeostasis, and APP/Aβ peptide clearance. The observed upregulation of proinflammatory miR-146a and anti-amyloidogenic/angiogenic miR-15a in 9-month-old Apoe-ko mice suggests their potential as tear-based biomarkers for ApoE dysfunction.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Hippocampal SIRT1 signaling mediates the ameliorative effect of treadmill exercise on anxiety- and depression-like behavior in APP/PS1 mice.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Anxiety and depression-like symptoms occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling mediates anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Exercise training improves anxiety and depression-like behavior in various disease models, such as the rat chronic restraint stress model, rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder, and rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate whether exercise ameliorates anxiety- and depression like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice and explore the potential mechanisms. METHODS: After eight weeks of exercise intervention, we assessed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. We then measured the levels of SIRT1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and mitochondrial biogenesis (CO2, ATP6, and mitochondrial content) using immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR, and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we investigated the effects of pharmacological activation of SIRT1 on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, the SIRT1/PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM signaling axis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. RESULTS: We first observed that treadmill exercise improved anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in six-month-old APP/PS1 mice and increased SIRT1 levels in the hippocampus. Pharmacological activation of hippocampal SIRT1 function also reduced anxiety and depression-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice. Meanwhile, both treadmill exercise and pharmacological activation of hippocampal SIRT1 increased the levels of PGC1α, NRF1, TFAM, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis (CO2, ATP6, or mitochondrial content) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal that treadmill exercise reduces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in six-month-old APP/PS1 mice by enhancing the SIRT1-dependent PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM axis, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in the hippocampus.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Arts therapies, encompassing art therapy, music therapy, drama therapy, and dance movement therapy with the broader practice of expressive arts therapies, have demonstrated positive outcomes in the treatment of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders (NNDs). Integrating arts therapies into telehealth has become increasingly important to improve accessibility for people with mobility impairments or those living in remote areas. This study aims to map the existing body of literature to provide an in-depth overview of telehealth in arts therapies for individuals with NNDs. METHODOLOGY: This scoping review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Six databases were systematically searched, with 2,888 articles screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria focused on primary research peer-reviewed articles in English that addressed telehealth arts therapies for NNDs. RESULTS: Seventeen telehealth studies published between 2009 and March 2024 were included, with a notable increase in publications after 2020. The studies covered various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Rett syndrome, and neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and mild cognitive impairment. Music therapy was the most widely studied modality. Interventions ranged from therapeutic singing and songwriting to virtual reality experiences. Different platforms and specialized virtual environments were used alongside pre-recorded sessions. Positive benefits included psychological enrichment, social connectivity, cognitive improvements, and brain changes, although some studies reported mixed or no significant effects in certain areas. CONCLUSION: Telehealth in arts therapies significantly benefits individuals with NNDs, improving accessibility and providing psychological, emotional, social, and cognitive benefits. The positive benefits observed highlight the potential of these interventions to improve overall well-being and daily functioning. Future research may focus on high-quality qualitative studies and neuroimaging assessments to further validate the impact of telehealth arts therapies.",

As the origins of those proteinopathies have been biochemically traced and genetically mapped, genetically engineered animal models carrying the specific mutations or variants are widely used for investigating the etiology of these diseases, as well as for testing potential therapeutics. This article focuses on the mouse models of Alzheimer disease and closely related frontotemporal dementia, particularly the ones that have provided most valuable knowledge, or are in a trajectory of doing so. More importantly, some of the major findings from these models are summarized, based on the recent single-cell transcriptomics, multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics studies.

    "AbstractText": "This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limitations of Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). NT-3, a critical neurotrophic factor, plays essential roles in hippocampal neuron growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity, making it a promising candidate for AD treatment. However, its clinical application is hindered by its inability to cross the BBB. To address this, we utilized genetic engineering techniques to fuse the TAT transmembrane peptide with NT-3, producing a recombinant NT-3 (T-NT-3) with enhanced membrane-penetrating capability. Protein characterization confirmed that T-NT-3 possesses good stability and the ability to cross the BBB. In vitro experiments demonstrated that T-NT-3 inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses in neural cells by activating TrkC receptors and suppressing M1 microglial activation. In vivo, T-NT-3 improved cognitive and memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice and reduced AD-associated pathological changes. These findings highlight the mechanisms by which T-NT-3 alleviates hippocampal neurotoxicity, providing a foundation for its future application as a recombinant protein therapy for AD.",

    "AbstractText": "β-Amyloid (Aβ) protein deposition, oxidative stress, and metal ion imbalance are established pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the imperative to efficiently reduce Aβ aggregates formation, alleviate oxidative stress, and chelate metal ions. Existing research indicates the necessity of developing multifunctional nanomaterials to facilitate multi-target therapy. In this work, we designed and prepared multifunctional selenium-doped carbonized polymer dots (SeCDs), and examined the multifunctionality at inhibiting Aβ, cleaning reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulating copper ions. SeCDs exhibit efficient clearance of active hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals. In addition, SeCDs can chelate Cu ions, therefore reducing the cytotoxicity linked to the Aβ-Cu complex. More importantly, SeCDs can effectively reduce the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. This study demonstrates the potential of carbon dots as a multifunctional β-sheet disruptor, while multifunctional SeCDs offer promising avenues for further research in the multi-target treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, this strategy provides a new perspective on the development of zero-dimensional carbon materials in Alzheimer's therapy.",

    "AbstractText": "Co-morbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (amyloid-beta and tau) is commonly observed in Lewy body dementia (LBD), and this may affect clinical outcomes. A systematic review of the effect of AD co-pathology on longitudinal clinical outcomes in LBD was conducted. A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (October 2024) yielded n = 3558 records that were screened by two independent reviewers. Included studies (n = 31) assessed AD co-pathology in LBD by neuropathologic examination (n = 10), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (n = 7), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 8) or plasma biomarkers (n = 6); and reported longitudinal clinical outcomes including cognitive and functional decline, mortality, or treatment response. Most neuropathology, PET and plasma studies reviewed demonstrated poorer prognosis in LBD + compared to LBD-, but discrepant findings were seen among CSF studies. No included study reported better outcomes in LBD+. The risk of bias was assessed with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. All studies rated as low risk of bias (n = 12) reported that the presence of AD co-pathology in LBD (LBD+) was associated with accelerated cognitive decline (n = 7/7), accelerated functional decline (n = 3/3), greater mortality (n = 2/2) and poorer response to treatment (n = 1/1). Among these studies, LBD+ was associated with an additional decline of -0.53 to -2.9 MMSE points/year compared to LBD-, while one study reported an adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in LBD + as 3.70. We conclude that AD co-pathology is associated with worse clinical outcomes in LBD whether assessed by greater cognitive decline, increased mortality or greater decline on functional assessment scales.",

    "AbstractText": "In developed countries age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma are the most common diseases of old age that cause irreversible blindness. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia among older adults, is often associated with AMD and glaucoma. Features of AD include extracellular accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and intracellular deposits of hyperphosphorylated forms of tau-protein. In addition, neuroinflammation and impaired iron metabolism in the brain are involved in the pathogenesis of AD, which ultimately leads to progressive neuronal death and dementia. It was found that the retina of patients with AMD also accumulates Aβ and iron, as well as Aβ and p-tau in retinal ganglion cells affected by glaucoma, and concomitant inflammation aggravates the pathological process. Patients with AD experience a marked decline in visual function which is thought to develop before the decline in cognitive function. Some are caused by degeneration of the visual cortex, others by retinal ganglion cell loss or retinal degeneration associated with AMD.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Over the past few decades, there has been a sudden rise in the incidence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in Western countries. However, current treatments often show limited efficacy in certain patients and are associated with adverse effects, which highlights the need for safer and more effective therapeutic approaches. Environmental factors, particularly dietary habits, have been observed to play a substantial role in the development of MS. In this study, we are the first to investigate the potential protective effect of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) in MS. ABA, which is abundant in fruits such as figs, apricots and bilberries, is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in conditions like depression and Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In this study, we investigated whether ABA supplementation enhances remyelination in both ex vivo and in vivo mouse models. RESULTS: Our results indicated that ABA enhanced remyelination and that this enhanced remyelination is associated with increased lipid droplet load, reduced levels of degraded myelin, and a higher abundance of F4/80+ cells in the demyelinated brain of mice treated with ABA. In in vitro models, we further demonstrated that ABA treatment elevates lipid droplet formation by enhancing the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Additionally, in a mouse model of microglial activation, we showed that ABA-treated mice maintain a less inflammatory microglial phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a crucial role for macrophages and microglia in enabling ABA to enhance the remyelination process. Furthermore, ABA's ability to improve remyelination together with its ability to reduce microglial activation, make ABA a promising candidate for modulating macrophage phenotype and reducing neuroinflammation in MS.",

    "AbstractText": "Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) are indispensable core techniques in cardiac surgery. Numerous studies have shown that cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest are associated with the occurrence of neuroinflammation, accompanied by the activation of microglia. Microglia, as macrophages in the central nervous system, play an irreplaceable role in neuroinflammation. Current research on neuroinflammation induced by microglia activation mainly focuses on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain, acquired brain injury, and others. However, there is relatively limited research on microglia and neuroinflammation under conditions of cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The close relationship between cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and cardiac surgery underscores the importance of identifying targets for intervening in neuroinflammation through microglia. This could greatly benefit cardiac surgery patients during cardiopulmonary bypass and the perioperative period, significantly improving patient prognosis. This review article provides the first comprehensive discussion on the signaling pathways associated with neuroinflammation triggered by microglia activation, the impact of cardiopulmonary bypass on microglia, as well as the current status and advancements in cardiopulmonary bypass animal models. It provides new insights and methods for the treatment of neuroinflammation related to cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, holding significant importance for clinical treatment by cardiac surgeons, management strategies by cardiopulmonary bypass physicians, and the development of neurologically related medications.",

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify PopPK models for evaluation. The evaluation process involved analyzing 390 serum concentration samples obtained from 361 Chinese adult inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Model predictability was evaluated by prediction-based and simulation-based diagnostics. Based on validation results, a modified PopPK model was constructed to characterize amisulpride pharmacokinetic in our patients. Monte Carlo simulation was employed to investigate non-adherence scenarios and the impact of subsequently administered remedial regimens. RESULTS: In the five assessed published models, four included trough concentrations from schizophrenia patients, and one combined single-dose data from healthy older adults and trough concentrations from older adults with Alzheimer's disease. The PE for population and individual predictions ranged from -92.89% to 27.02% and -24.82% to 4.04%, respectively. In the simulation-based diagnostics, the NPDE results indicated noticeable bias in all models. Therefore, a modified one-compartment model, with estimated creatinine clearance(eCLcr) as covariates on the apparent clearance (CL/F) of amisulpride, was developed. For delays in medication dosing, if the delay is within 12 hours, take half the missed dose right away, then resume the normal schedule; if the delay is up to 24 hours, just continue with the regular dosing schedule. CONCLUSION: Existing published models lack the necessary reliability for cross-center application. Future prospective studies are required to assess our model before integrating it into clinical practice. Model-based simulations provided a rational approach to propose remedial strategies for delayed or missed doses.",

However, the precise roles and mechanism of CIRP in the functional changes in astrocytes during the development of AD are still unknown. This study aimed to assess gene expression alterations in astrocytes after they overexpress CIRP (oe-CIRP) and to explore the relationship between abnormal CIRP expression and AD. METHODS: We created astrocyte cell lines with a CIRP or control vector expression using three human glioma cell lines U87, U251 and H4, and analyzed the mRNA expression profiles of 3 pairs of cells via microarray. Bioinformatics identified differentially expressed mRNAs between CIRP-overexpressing (ov-CIRP) and control groups, validated by q-PCR and Western blotting (WB). Finally, the effect of CIRP overexpression in astrocytes on neurons was observed in a coculture system. RESULTS: We identified 119 mRNAs with obvious fold changes between the ov-CIRP and control groups for all 3 pairs of human glioma cell lines. The biological functional analysis indicated that urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a gene whose expression significantly decreased after CIRP overexpression, was closely associated with AD. WB and q-PCR confirmed that CIRP overexpression significantly inhibited uPA at both mRNA and protein levels in U87, U251 and H4 cells. Moreover, compared with those cocultured with control astrocytes, SH-SY5Y cells cocultured with CIRP-overexpressing astrocytes exhibited a significant increase in the expression of amyloid-β (Aβ)1-42 and the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau). CONCLUSION: CIRP overexpression in astrocytes inhibits uPA expression, promoting Aβ1-42 production and tau phosphorylation in neurons, thereby increasing AD risk. These results suggest that the overexpression of CIRP in astrocytes contributes to the development of AD.",

Measuring concomitant pathology in vivo can improve clinical and research diagnoses and prediction of cognitive trajectories. Tau PET imaging may serve a dual role in Lewy body disease by measuring cortical tau aggregation as well as assessing dopaminergic loss attributed to binding to neuromelanin within substantia nigra. We sought to characterize 18F-PI-2620, a next generation PET tracer, in individuals with Lewy body disease. We recruited 141 participants for 18F-PI-2620 PET scans from the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Stanford Aging and Memory Study, most of whom also had β-amyloid status available (139/141) from PET or cerebrospinal fluid. We compared 18F-PI-2620 uptake within entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, precuneus and lingual gyrus, as well as substantia nigra, across participants with Lewy body disease [Parkinson's disease (n = 29), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 14)] and Alzheimer's disease (n = 28), in addition to cognitively unimpaired healthy older adults (n = 70). Mean bilateral signal was extracted from cortical regions of interest in 18F-PI-2620 standard uptake value ratio (inferior cerebellar grey reference) images normalized to template space. A subset of participants received cognitive testing and/or the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III motor exam (off medication). 18F-PI-2620 uptake was low overall in Lewy body disease and correlated with β-amyloid PET in temporal lobe regions and precuneus. Moreover, inferior temporal 18F-PI-2620 uptake was significantly elevated in β-amyloid positive relative to β-amyloid negative participants with Lewy body disease. Temporal lobe 18F-PI-2620 signal was not associated with memory in Lewy body disease, but uptake within precuneus and lingual gyrus was associated with worse executive function and attention/working memory performance. Finally, substantia nigra 18F-PI-2620 signal was significantly reduced in participants with Parkinson's disease, and lower substantia nigra signal was associated with greater motor impairment. These findings suggest that although levels are lower than in Alzheimer's disease, small elevations in cortical tau are associated with cognitive function in Lewy body disease relevant domains, and that reduced 18F-PI-2620 binding in substantia nigra may represent loss of dopaminergic neurons. Cortical tau and neuromelanin binding within substantia nigra represent two unique signals in the same PET image that may be informative in the context of cognitive and motor deficits, respectively, in Lewy body disease.",

    "AbstractText": "The preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease represents a crucial time window for therapeutic intervention but requires the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers that are sensitive to the effects of disease-modifying drugs. Amyloid peptide and tau proteins, the main histological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, have been widely used as biomarkers of anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs. However, these biomarkers do not fully capture the multiple biological pathways of the brain. Indeed, robust amyloid-target engagement by anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies has recently translated into modest cognitive and clinical benefits in Alzheimer's disease patients, albeit with potentially life-threatening side effects. Moreover, targeting the tau pathway has yet to result in any positive clinical outcomes. Findings from computational neuroscience have demonstrated that brain regions do not work in isolation but are interconnected within complex network structures. Brain connectivity studies suggest that misfolded proteins can spread through these connections, leading to the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease is a pathology of network disconnectivity. Based on these assumptions, here we discuss how incorporating brain connectivity outcomes could better capture global brain functionality and, in conjunction with traditional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, could facilitate the clinical development of new disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs.",

The efficacy of palliative sedation needs to be monitored to ensure patient comfort. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy using discomfort levels combined with sedation/agitation levels. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, adult patients with advanced malignancies were recruited from hospice units, palliative care units, and hospital wards in five European countries. Health care professionals used proxy observations of discomfort levels (Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type, range 0-27) and sedation/agitation levels (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale modified for palliative care inpatients), range - 5 to + 4) to evaluate the efficacy of palliative sedation. RESULTS: In 78 participants, discomfort levels were monitored during palliative sedation. The mean discomfort score before start was 9.4 points (95% CI 8.3-10.5), which showed a significant decrease of 6.0 points (95% CI 4.8-7.1) after start of sedation for the total sedation period. In the multivariable analysis, no significant factors influencing baseline discomfort levels were identified. The discomfort and depth of sedation scores were found to be positively correlated, with an r of 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.82). The internal consistency of the discomfort scale was good (0.83), but the \"Noisy breathing\" item was less informative of the total discomfort score. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of palliative sedation can be evaluated by measuring discomfort levels combined with sedation/agitation levels. The measurement of discomfort levels might provide a more specific and detailed evaluation of adequate sedation.

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a diverse neurodegenerative disease, is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80 % of all cases. The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, and there is no cure at this time. Recent developments in transcriptome-wide profiling have led to the identification of a number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among these, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)-long transcripts that don't seem to be able to code for proteins-have drawn attention because they function as regulatory agents in a variety of biological processes. Recent research suggests that lncRNAs play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by modulating tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid production, synaptic impairment, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, though their precise effects on the disorder are unknown. The biology and modes of action of the best-characterized lncRNAs in AD will be outlined here, with an emphasis on their possible involvement in the pathophysiology of the disease. As lncRNAs may offer prospective prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD, a greater comprehension of the molecular processes and the intricate network of interactions in which they are implicated could pave the way for future research.",

    "AbstractText": "The formation of the pyroglutamate variant of amyloid beta (pGlu-Aβ), which is extremely hydrophobic, rapidly aggregating, and highly neurotoxic, is mediated by the action of secretory glutaminyl cyclase (sQC). The pGlu-Aβ often acts as a seed for the aggregation of the full length Aβ and contributes to the overall load of Aβ plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, inhibiting sQC is a potential approach to limit the formation of pGlu-Aβ and to modify the progression of AD. This study presents two novel molecules containing benzimidazole-6-carboxamide, namely LSB-09 and LSB-24, as promising sQC inhibitors. These inhibitors demonstrated moderate toxicity in human neuroblastoma cell lines and possessed IC50 values in the micromolar range (40 and 4 μM for LSB-09 and LSB-24, respectively). Additionally, the X-ray crystal structure of the sQC-LSB-09 complex revealed a unique binding mode, and a systematic computational investigation elucidated the binding mode for LSB-24. The binding mode of these two benzimidazole-6-carboxamide inhibitors offers a potential platform for designing attractive lead candidates against sQC.",

    "AbstractText": "Structural brain changes underlie cognitive changes and interindividual variability in cognition in older age. By using structural MRI data-driven clustering, we aimed to identify subgroups of cognitively unimpaired older adults based on brain change patterns and assess how changes in cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume relate to cognitive change. We tested (1) which brain structural changes predict cognitive change (2) whether these are associated with core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and (3) the degree of overlap between clusters derived from different structural modalities in 1899 cognitively healthy older adults followed up to 16 years. We identified four groups for each brain feature, based on the degree of a main longitudinal component of decline. The minimal overlap between features suggested that each contributed uniquely and independently to structural brain changes in aging. Cognitive change and baseline cognition were associated with cortical area change, whereas higher baseline levels of phosphorylated tau and amyloid-β related to changes in subcortical volume. These results may contribute to a better understanding of different aging trajectories.",

This diagnostic disclosure sets the stage for subsequent care. Diagnostic disclosure for individuals with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementias (ADRD) is particularly nuanced and requires a conscientious approach. Clinicians must assess patients' understanding and appreciation of symptoms, goals for the evaluation, and desire for information. Because AD/ADRD can impact patients' perceptions of their symptoms, it is recommended to include an informant or care partner for this assessment and for future care. Here, we provide guidance for addressing the complexities of AD/ADRD diagnostic disclosure to build clinicians' confidence in communicating diagnostic findings and a plan of care. HIGHLIGHTS: Diagnostic disclosure is a key part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment. The disclosure process begins at the moment a cognitive evaluation is initiated. Care partners must be included in the cognitive evaluation and diagnostic disclosure. Clinicians should use patient-centered communication for evaluation and disclosure.",

Previous studies focused on microglial amyloid-β (Aβ) phagocytosis with less attention on the impact of TREM2R47H mutation on blood monocytes. METHODS: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models were used to assess the contribution of blood monocytes carrying TREM2R47H mutation to AD. RESULTS: Aβ phagocytosis was compromised in mouse monocytes carrying the TREM2R47H mutation. Transplantation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) carrying TREM2R47H mutation increased cerebral Aβ burden and aggravated AD-type pathologies. Moreover, the replacement of TREM2R47H-BMCs restored monocytic Aβ phagocytosis, lowered Aβ levels in the blood and brain, and improved cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Our study reveals that blood monocytes carrying the TREM2R47H mutation substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, and correcting the TREM2R47H mutation in BMCs would be a potential therapeutic approach for those carrying this mutation.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (tauopathy) is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, a metabolic shift due to the Warburg effect results in increased lactate production. Lactate can induce a post-translational modification (PTM) on proteins that conjugates lactyl groups to lysine (K) residues, which is known as lactylation. METHODS: We analyzed lactylation of tau in control and AD brain tissue and conducted cell-based assays. In addition, we used in vitro assays to determine whether p300 catalyzed tau lactylation. RESULTS: Quantitative proteomics detected that tau lactylation was elevated in AD brains, with K residue at position 331 (K331) being a prominent site. Lactate induced tau lactylation, which increased tau phosphorylation and cleavage and reduced ubiquitination. Inhibition of lactate production lowered tau lactylation; p300 catalyzed tau lactylation. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that tau lactylation links metabolic dysregulation with tauopathy and could serve as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target. HIGHLIGHTS: Elevated tau lactylation, particularly at K331, is evident in in human AD brain samples. Lactate induces tau lactylation, enhancing phosphorylation and cleavage while inhibiting ubiquitination.

Small EVs, also called exosomes, are lipid-bound particles (≈30-150 nm) that play a role in healthy and pathophysiological interactions, including intercellular communication, by transporting bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Their ability to cross biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier, makes them ideal candidates for targeted therapeutic interventions. In the context of chronic diseases, exosomes can be engineered to deliver active agents, including small molecules and siRNAs to specific target cells, providing a novel approach to precision medicine. Moreover, exosomes show great promise as repositories for diagnostic biomarkers. Their cargo can reflect the physiological and pathological status of the parent cells, making them valuable indicators of disease progression and response to treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of exosomes in four chronic diseases: cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and orthopedic disease, which significantly impact global public health due to their high prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, the potential of exosomes as valuable tools for theranostics and disease management is highlighted. Finally, the challenges associated with exosomes and their demonstrated potential for advancing future nanomedicine applications are discussed.",

In this study, we examined the quality of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) that beneficiaries entered after hospital discharge under different payment models. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries who were discharged from hospitals and admitted to SNFs between 2013 and 2018. KEY MEASURES: The exposure variable was a payment indicator, including ACO, MA, or non-ACO traditional Medicare (TM) fee-for-service. The dependent variable was high overall quality SNF, defined as with at least 4-star rating in the CMS Nursing Home Care Compare. ANALYTIC PLAN: We examined the payer distribution by dementia diagnosis using ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) fixed effects and adjusted for age, gender, and race. We also estimated the probabilities of entering high-quality SNF as a function of payer status and dementia diagnosis each year using hospital and ZCTA fixed effects and accounting for beneficiary-level covariates. RESULTS: Among SNF admissions from 2013 to 2018, the share of ACO-attributed beneficiaries increased from 7.6% to 20.2%, MA enrollees increased from 25.2% to 32.8%, and non-ACO-attributed TM enrollees decreased from 67.2% to 47.3%. Consistently, ACO-attributed beneficiaries were the most likely, while MA enrollees were the least likely to enter high-quality SNFs, regardless of dementia diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight significant differences in access to high-quality SNFs across Medicare payment models, with ACO-attributed beneficiaries consistently experiencing better access than their MA or traditional Medicare counterparts, regardless of dementia diagnosis. These results underscore the need for further investigation into how payment models influence care quality and access, particularly for vulnerable populations.",

The Neurotrack Cognitive Battery (NCB) offers an appealing, web-based application that may be sensitive to early cognitive changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. The NCB contains measures that were conceptually derived from animal lesion studies. The current study sought to investigate the construct and diagnostic validity of the NCB among those with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Participants (n = 47) with and without MCI were administered the NCB and traditional cognitive tests. Three of six NCB measures assessing domains of memory, processing speed, and executive functioning demonstrated moderate to strong associations with well-established cognitive performance tests. In classifying those with and without MCI, sensitivities of these three NCB measures ranged from 0.47 to 0.74, and specificities ranged from 0.78 to 1.00. For traditional cognitive measures, sensitivities ranged from 0.74 to 0.84, and specificities ranged from 0.74 to 0.94. Overall, web-based cognitive test measures pertaining to cognitive domains of memory, processing speed, and executive functioning may serve as highly portable screening tools for detecting the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

FDG-PET elucidates glucose metabolic reductions due to altered neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex, allowing detection and identification of neurodegenerative processes. This study aims to investigate cerebral glucose metabolism in cognitively impaired elderly patients with BD using FDG-PET imaging, to elucidate potential underlying mechanisms and improve diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of FDG-PET scans from 32 cognitively impaired elderly patients with BD (mean age 70.4 years). These were compared with scans from 35 non-degenerative controls (NDC) and patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 27), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 26), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 18). Voxel-wise statistical analysis was performed using SPM software, adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS: No significant cortical hypometabolism was found in patients with BD compared to NDC. In contrast, typical patterns of hypometabolism were observed in the AD, FTD, and DLB groups. The findings suggest that late-life cognitive impairment in patients with BD is not due to a single common neurodegenerative process. CONCLUSION: The absence of abnormal cortical metabolism in cognitively impaired elderly patients with BD suggests that cognitive impairment in this population may not be driven by a common neurodegenerative pathway.

The aim of this study is to examine the additional value of MRI-based brain volumetry in separating patients with DLB (AD+/-) from patients with AD and controls. METHODS: We included 1518 participants from four cohorts (ADC, ADNI, PDBP and PredictND); 147 were patients with DLB (n = 76, DLB/AD+; n = 71, DLB/AD-), 668 patients with AD dementia, and 703 controls. We used an automatic segmentation tool to compute volumes of 70 brain regions, for which age, sex, and head size-dependent z-scores were calculated. We compared individual regions between the diagnostic groups and evaluated whether combining multiple regions improves differentiation. To assess the diagnostic performance, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity. RESULTS: The classifier using the combination of 70 volumetric brain regions correctly classified 60% of patients with DLB and 70% of patients with AD dementia. For DLB vs. AD, the classifier produced an AUC of 0.80 (0.77-0.83), which outperformed the best individual region, hippocampus (AUC: 0.73 [0.69-0.76], p < 0.01). For the comparison of DLB/AD+ vs. AD, the classifier increased the AUC to 0.74 (0.68-0.80), which was 0.70 (0.64-0.76) for the hippocampus, p = 0.25. CONCLUSION: Using a combination of volumetric brain regions improved the classification accuracy, and thus the discrimination, of patients with DLB with and without concomitant AD pathology and AD.

The hippocampus and cortex regions of SAMP8 harvested after the test showed lower amyloid ß (Aß) accumulation in the Tyr-Pro group than those in the control and amino acid groups. Consistent with the lower level of Aß, decreased expression of ß-secretase (BACE1) and markedly increased expression (4-times higher) of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) were obtained compared to those in the control group.

Use of oral anticoagulant (OAC) medications offers a lower risk of dementia, but it is unclear whether differences exist between types of OAC agents. OBJECTIVE: This was a secondary analysis to explore whether the progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment to dementia differs between adults with AF on warfarin versus non-vitamin K inhibitor medications (NOACs) using data extracted from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center clinical case series. METHODS: Subjects with AF on OACs, having normal cognition and no stroke at baseline, and at least 1 follow-up visit were included. OAC usage was calculated based on follow-up time and reported previous OAC use. Continuation ratio models (with subject-specific random intercepts) were used to examine the association between OAC type and cognitive diagnosis controlling for cognitive diagnosis from previous visit. RESULTS: Among 1475 eligible participants, 478 reported taking warfarin (n = 396) or NOACs (n = 82) at baseline (mean age of 79 years, 51% females, 84% non-Hispanic White).

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), primary age-related tauopathy (PART), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) all feature hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau)-immunoreactive neurofibrillary degeneration, but differ in neuroanatomical distribution and progression of neurofibrillary degeneration and amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. METHODS: We used Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling to compare the expression of 70 proteins in neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing and non-NFT-bearing neurons in hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA4 subregions and entorhinal cortex of cases with autopsy-confirmed AD (n = 8), PART (n = 7), and CTE (n = 5). RESULTS: There were numerous subregion-specific differences related to Aβ processing, autophagy/proteostasis, inflammation, gliosis, oxidative stress, neuronal/synaptic integrity, and p-tau epitopes among these different disorders. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that there are subregion-specific proteomic differences among the neurons of these disorders, which appear to be influenced to a large degree by the presence of hippocampal Aβ. These proteomic differences may play a role in the differing hippocampal p-tau distribution and pathogenesis of these disorders. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), possible primary age-related tauopathy (PART), definite PART, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can be differentiated based on the proteomic composition of their neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)- and non-NFT-bearing neurons. The proteome of these NFT- and non-NFT-bearing neurons is largely correlated with the presence or absence of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons in CTE and definite PART (Aβ-independent pathologies) share numerous proteomic similarities that distinguish them from ADNC and possible PART (Aβ-positive pathologies).",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows significant sex differences in prevalence and clinical manifestations, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: This study used a large-scale, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human prefrontal cortex to investigate sex-dependent molecular changes in AD. Our approach combined cell type-specific and sex-specific differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment, gene regulatory network construction, and cell-cell communication analysis to identify sex-dependent changes. RESULTS: We found significant sex-specific gene expression patterns and pathway alterations in AD. Male astrocytes showed changes in cell death pathways, with RPTOR as a key regulator, while female astrocytes had alterations in Wnt signaling and cell cycle regulation. Cell-cell communication analysis uncovered sex-specific intercellular signaling patterns, with male-specific impacts on apoptosis-related signaling and female-specific alterations in Wnt and calcium signaling. DISCUSSION: This study reveals sex-dependent gene expression patterns, pathway alterations, and intercellular communication changes, suggesting the need for sex-specific approaches in AD research. HIGHLIGHTS: Single-cell transcriptomics reveals significant sex-specific molecular signatures in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Male astrocytes show enhanced modulation of apoptotic and cell death pathways in AD; female astrocytes exhibit distinct alterations in Wnt signaling and cell-cycle regulation. Sex-dimorphic changes in mitochondrial gene expression are observed in excitatory neurons, suggesting divergent energy metabolism profiles may contribute to AD sex differences. RPTOR is identified as a key regulator of male-specific changes in astrocytes, implicating the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway in sex-dependent AD pathology. New cell-cell communication analyses reveal sex-specific patterns of intercellular signaling, providing insights into how cellular interactions may differentially contribute to AD pathology in males and females.",

    "AbstractText": "There is a pressing need for accessible biomarkers with high diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis to facilitate widespread screening, particularly in underserved groups. Saliva is an emerging specimen for measuring AD biomarkers, with distinct contexts of use that could complement blood and cerebrospinal fluid and detect various analytes. An interdisciplinary, international group of AD and related dementias (ADRD) researchers convened and performed a narrative review of published studies on salivary AD biomarkers. We critically appraised the current state of the literature, examining both consistencies and discrepancies in existing pre-analytical variables and methodologies. We discussed how various pre-analytical variables could influence the detection and quantification of salivary biomarkers, showed technologies available to standardize collection procedures, and proposed a standardized pre-analytical protocol to guide future studies on salivary AD biomarker examinations. We identified potential contexts of use, gaps, and priorities and proposed future research directions. HIGHLIGHTS: Given its non-invasive nature, wider accessibility, and cultural acceptability, particularly in low-resourced settings, saliva is a biofluid complementary to blood and CSF. Current salivary AD biomarker studies do not control for many confounding pre-analytical variables during the sampling process, potentially leading to inaccurate salivary biomarker readings and conclusions, contributing to conflicting findings. Reviewing the current literature, including the consistencies and non-consistencies observed in the existing parameters and methodologies, discussing how they can affect salivary AD biomarker detection and quantification.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Some individuals show intact cognition despite the presence of neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The plasticity of parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons might contribute to resilience. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), that is, extracellular matrix structures around neurons, modulate PV neuron function. We hypothesize that PNNs play a role in resilience to AD. METHODS: PNN amount and morphology were determined in immunolabelled sections of the frontal cortex of control, AD and resilient subjects. Expression levels of genes related to PNNs and microglia signatures were evaluated by bulk RNA sequencing. RESULTS: The expression of the PNN-component aggrecan around PV neurons is decreased in resilient and AD subjects, whereas PNN-sugar chains are reduced only in resilient subjects. In AD, fewer presynaptic terminals on PV neurons are detected and genes related to PNN degradation are upregulated. DISCUSSION: These data show distinct PNN changes in individuals resilient to AD, which may contribute to preserved cognition despite the neuropathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Aggrecan levels are decreased in the frontal cortex of AD and resilient subjects. In resilient subjects, WFA+ PNNs are reduced around neuronal somata. In AD patients, PV neurons show disrupted WFA peridendritic staining and synaptic loss. Expression levels of PNN-degrading enzymes are higher in AD.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: The 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) recapitulates amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and pronounced seizure susceptibility observed in patients with AD. Forty-hertz audiovisual stimulation is a noninvasive technique that entrains gamma neural oscillations and can reduce Aβ pathology and modulate glial expression in AD models. We hypothesized that 40-Hz sensory stimulation would improve seizure susceptibility in 5xFAD mice and this would be associated with reduction of plaques and modulation of glial phenotypes. METHODS: 5xFAD mice and wild-type (WT) littermates received 1 h/day 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation or sham (n = 7-11/group), beginning 2 weeks before and continuing throughout amygdala kindling epileptogenesis. Postmortem analyses included Aβ pathology and morphology of astrocytes and microglia. RESULTS: 5xFAD mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to seizures compared to WT, evidenced by fewer stimulations to reach kindling endpoint (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.46, p < .0001) and a trend to higher seizure severity (odds ratio [OR] = .34, p = .059). Forty-hertz stimulation reduced the behavioral severity of the first seizure (OR = 4.04, p = .02) and delayed epileptogenesis, increasing the number of stimulations required to reach kindling endpoint (IRR = .82, p = .01) compared to sham, regardless of genotype. 5xFAD mice receiving sensory stimulation exhibited ~50% reduction in amyloid pathology compared to sham. Furthermore, markers of astrocytes and microglia were upregulated in both genotypes receiving 40-Hz stimulation. SIGNIFICANCE: Forty-hertz sensory entrainment slows epileptogenesis in the mouse amygdala kindling model. Although this intervention improves Aβ pathology in 5xFAD mice, the observed antiepileptogenic effect may also relate to effects on glia, because mice without Aβ plaques (i.e., WT) also experienced antiepileptogenic effects of the intervention.",

We quantify the association between AD polygenic risk score (AD-PRS) and WMHV, exploring single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are proximal to genes overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species. METHODS: In a UK-Biobank sub-sample (mean age = 64, range = 45-81 years), we associate WMHV with (1) AD-PRS estimated via SNPs across the genome (minus apolipoprotein E [APOE] locus) and (2) AD-PRS estimated with SNPs proximal to specific genes that are overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species. RESULTS: We observed a positive association between non-APOE-AD-PRS and WMHVs. We further demonstrate an association between WMHVs and AD-PRS constructed with SNPs that are proximal to genes over-represented in smooth muscles cells (SMCs; β = 0.135, PFWE  < 0.01) and internally replicated (PDISCOVERY+REPLICATION < 0.01). DISCUSSION: Common AD genetic risk could explain physiological processes underlying vascular pathology in AD. SMC function may offer a treatment target to prevent WMHV-related AD pathophysiology prior to the onset of symptoms. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, link to increased white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV). WMHVs indicate vascular risk and neurovascular injury in AD. The broader genetic link between AD risk and WMHV is not fully understood. We quantify AD polygenic risk score (PRS) associations with WMHV, excluding APOE. AD-PRS in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) shows a significant association with increased WMHV.",

However, many approaches analyze single measures averaged over regions of interest without considering the underlying fiber geometry. METHODS: We propose a novel macrostructure-informed normative tractometry (MINT) framework to investigate how white matter (WM) microstructure and macrostructure are jointly altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We compared MINT-derived metrics with univariate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to examine how fiber geometry may impact the interpretation of microstructure. RESULTS: In two multisite cohorts from North America and India, we find consistent patterns of microstructural and macrostructural anomalies implicated in MCI and dementia; we also rank diffusion metrics' sensitivity to dementia. DISCUSSION: We show that MINT, by jointly modeling tract shape and microstructure, has the potential to disentangle and better interpret the effects of degenerative disease on the brain's neural pathways. HIGHLIGHTS: Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics may be due to macroscopic changes. Normative models encode normal variability of diffusion metrics in healthy controls. Variational autoencoder applied on tractography can learn patterns of fiber geometry. WM microstructure and macrostructure are modeled with multivariate methods.

This study proposes the first artificial intelligence framework for characterizing multiple ion channel kinetics of whole-cell recordings. The framework integrates machine learning for anomaly detection and deep learning for multi-class classification. The anomaly detection excludes recordings that are incompatible with ion channel behavior. The multi-class classification combined a 1D convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention mechanism to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of the recordings. The framework achieves an accuracy of 97.58% in classifying 124 test datasets into six categories based on ion channel kinetics. The utility of the novel framework is demonstrated in two applications: Alzheimer's disease drug screening and nanomatrix-induced neuronal differentiation. In drug screening, the framework illustrates the inhibitory effects of memantine on endogenous channels, and antagonistic interactions among potassium, magnesium, and calcium ion channels. For nanomatrix-induced differentiation, the classifier indicates the effects of differentiation conditions on sodium and potassium channels associated with action potentials, validating the functional properties of differentiated neurons for Parkinson's disease treatment. The proposed framework is promising for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of ion channel kinetics analysis in electrophysiological research.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Tooth loss, periodontal infection and their relationship to cognitive impairment and other dementias: A review.",
    "AbstractText": "Our review study addresses the issue of tooth loss, which is caused by loss of masticatory function and its impact on cognitive functions, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Numerous studies have confirmed a positive correlation between premature tooth loss, reduction in masticatory function and significant cognitive decline observed through learning disabilities, including overcoming ordinary life problems to early and advanced forms of dementia. Reduced numbers of teeth in the main food processing area, i.e., loss of large molars, have been implicated as a possible cause of cognitive impairment. In research in this area, some groups of major etiopathogenetic causes of this issue have also been established. A significant etiopathogenetic cause of tooth loss is the disappearance of their mechanoreceptors in the periodontium, causing the disappearance of sensorimotor excitation via the cranial nerve V and the associated atrophic changes in the trigeminal brain nuclei and their branching in the Locus Coeruleus area. It may cause further neurodegenerative involvement in this area, one of the centers of the adrenergic system involved in cognitive function. Relatively well-studied factors are the lack of blood supply to the cerebral area during inadequate mastication caused by loss of molars and the consequent hypoxia of brain and nerve structures. In the research and development of Alzheimer's disease, there have been many recent references to the fact that the primary bacterium causing periodontitis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, can infect the neurons of the cranial nerve V ending close to the Locus Coeruleus and thus tau proteins, after tooth extractions, can spread to other subcortical nuclei in the brain. These findings are of great relevance to clinical practice in dentistry as we strive to prevent tooth loss in the distal compartment, which is made possible by the tremendous expansion of endodontic techniques and technologies to save de facto every tooth and its periodontium with the mechanoreceptors necessary to preserve sensorimotor nerve excitability and sensorimotor nerve networks. We uncompromisingly eliminate every periodontal infection in the subgingival region as part of our preventive-therapeutical procedures.",

    "AbstractText": "Cognitive function in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates to olfactory performance. Aging and disease progression both show marked olfactory deficits in humans and rodents. As a clear understanding of what causes olfactory deficits is still missing, research on this topic is paramount to diagnostics and early intervention therapy. A recent development of this research is focusing on GABAergic interneurons. Both aging and AD show a change in excitation/inhibition balance, indicating reduced inhibitory network functions. In the olfactory system, inhibition has an especially prominent role in processing information, as the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station of olfactory information in the brain, contains an unusually high number of inhibitory interneurons. This review summarizes the current knowledge on inhibitory interneurons at the level of the OB and the primary olfactory cortices to gain an overview of how these neurons might influence olfactory behavior. We also compare changes in interneuron composition in different olfactory brain areas between healthy aging and AD as the most common neurodegenerative disease. We find that pathophysiological changes in olfactory areas mirror findings from hippocampal and cortical regions that describe a marked cell loss for GABAergic interneurons in AD but not aging. Rather than differences in brain areas, differences in vulnerability were shown for different interneuron populations through all olfactory regions, with somatostatin-positive cells most strongly affected.",

However, studies using animal models of AD are quite limited. METHODS: This study investigates the aftereffects of tACS and tDCS on brain EEG activity and associated exploratory behavior in normal aged and APP/PS1 transgenic mice (15 months old). Anodal tDCS and 10 Hz tACS (350 μA, 20 min) were applied once and EEGs were recorded from the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during spontaneous home-cage state and open-field exploration. RESULTS: A key finding was that tDCS induced significant alpha (8-12 Hz) EEG changes while tACS induced peak frequency changes in the group difference between normal aged and AD mice. However, both groups showed similar increases in theta (4-8 Hz) EEG activity during open-field exploration and increases in gamma (20-100 Hz) EEG activity in spontaneous state, suggesting that the ongoing physiological state may be related to some of the EEG changes.

It is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological changes lead to widespread neuronal damage, significantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This comprehensive review aims to explore various aspects of Alzheimer's disease, including its epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic advancements, management strategies, caregiving challenges, and emerging therapeutic interventions. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus, from their inception to May 2024. The search strategy incorporated a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms such as \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"epidemiology,\" \"risk factors,\" \"symptoms,\" \"diagnosis,\" \"management,\" \"caregiving,\" \"treatment,\" and \"novel therapies.\" Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used to refine the search, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: AD is significantly influenced by genetic predispositions, such as the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, along with modifiable environmental factors like diet, physical activity, and cognitive engagement. Diagnostic approaches have evolved with advances in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, PET), and biomarker analysis, allowing for earlier detection and intervention. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association have updated diagnostic criteria to include biomarker data, enhancing early diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The management of AD includes pharmacological treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, which provide symptomatic relief but do not slow disease progression. Emerging therapies, including amyloid-beta and tau-targeting treatments, gene therapy, and immunotherapy, offer potential for disease modification. The critical role of caregivers is underscored, as they face considerable emotional, physical, and financial burdens. Support programs, communication strategies, and educational interventions are essential for improving caregiving outcomes. While significant advancements have been made in understanding and managing AD, ongoing research is necessary to identify new therapeutic targets and enhance diagnostic and treatment strategies. A holistic approach, integrating clinical, genetic, and environmental factors, is essential for addressing the multifaceted challenges of Alzheimer's disease and improving outcomes for both patients and caregivers.",

    "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the brain, manifesting itself with both motor and non-motor symptoms. A critical element of this pathology is neuroinflammation, which triggers a harmful neurotoxic cycle, exacerbating cell death within the central nervous system. AD-16 (also known as GIBH-130) is a recently identified compound capable of reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in Alzheimer's disease models. Here, for the first time, we sought to comprehend the potential impact of orally administered AD-16 in mitigating neurodegeneration and subsequent disease progression in PD. To accomplish this, 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilateral striatal injections were employed to induce a PD model in male C57BL/6 mice. Cylinder and apomorphine-induced rotation behavior tests were conducted to assess motor behavior and validate the PD model 3 days after the injection. AD-16 was administered via gavage daily between days 3 and 9 after surgery. On the last day of treatment, motor tests were performed again. All animals were euthanized on day 10 and immunohistochemistry techniques were performed to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Iba-1 and thus label dopaminergic neurons and microglia in the SNc and striatum (CPu). These same regions were collected for ELISA assays to assess different cytokine concentrations. Our results revealed an enhancement in the motor function of the AD-16-treated animals, as well as reduced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. In addition, AD-16 reduced the increase in microglia density and prevented the changes in its morphology observed in the PD animal models. Furthermore, AD-16 was able to avoid the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels that were present in 6-OHDA-injected animals who received vehicle. Consequently, AD-16 emerges as a compound with significant potential for negative modulation of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation suppression in the 6-OHDA animal model of Parkinson's disease.",

Nevertheless, advancements in understanding AD's diverse pathobiology suggest the potential for establishing blood-based methods for differential diagnosis. METHODS: We devised a novel assay combining immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to quantify Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides in plasma. We then assessed its performance against existing assays (Shimadzu and Simoa) and evaluated a range of other blood-based biomarkers, including GFAP, NfL, and pTau-181, for differentiating between AD and bvFTD. RESULTS: The novel IP-MS assay measuring the Aβ42/40 ratio demonstrated an AUC of 0.82 for differentiating AD from control subjects. While it did not significantly outperform the composite biomarker score from the Shimadzu assay (AUC = 0.79, P = 0.67), it significantly outperformed the Shimadzu Aβ42/40 ratio (AUC = 0.65, P = 0.037) and the Simoa Aβ42/40 assay (AUC = 0.57, P = 0.023). Aβ biomarkers provided limited utility in distinguishing AD from bvFTD. In contrast, pTau181 and GFAP exhibited strong discriminatory power for differentiating AD from bvFTD, with AUCs of 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. Combining pTau181 and GFAP enhanced diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: We introduced a novel IP-MS assay that demonstrated comparable precision to the Shimadzu composite score in differentiating AD from non-neurodegenerative control groups. However, Aβ levels did not enhance the discrimination between AD and bvFTD. Furthermore, our findings support the utility of combining pTau181 and GFAP as a robust strategy for the blood-based differentiation of AD and bvFTD.",

METHODS: Ninety-two cognitively unimpaired adults (mean age = 59.85 ± 13.77 years, range = 30-85, 47 females) underwent 10 days of actigraphic recordings, and blood drawing. Standard non-parametric indices of 24-h rest-activity rhythm fragmentation (intradaily variability, IV) and stability (interdaily stability, IS) were extracted from actigraphy data using the GGIR package. Plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid-β42/40 (Aβ42/40), total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) or threonine 231 (p-tau231) were measured using Single molecule array technology. Multiple linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, education, body mass index, and actigraphic recording duration. RESULTS: Higher IV, indicating worse 24-h rest-activity rhythm fragmentation, was associated with elevated levels of plasma NfL (t(85) = 4.26, P < 0.0001), GFAP (t(85) = 2.49, P = 0.01), and at trend level with lower Aβ42/40 ratio values (t(85) = -1.95, P = 0.054). Lower IS, reflecting less day-to-day stability in the 24-h rest-activity rhythm, was linked to elevated levels of plasma NfL (t(85) = -2.24, P = 0.03), but not with the other plasma biomarkers. Importantly, interaction models demonstrated that male participants were driving the observed relationships between IV and plasma NfL (t(84) = 4.05, P < 0.001) or GFAP (t(84) = 3.60, P < 0.001), but also revealed a male vulnerability in models testing interactions with p-tau181 (IV: t(76) = 3.71, P < 0.001; IS: t(76) = -3.30, P = 0.001) and p-tau231 (IV: t(82) = 3.28, P = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses further showed that accounting for potential confounding factors such as APOE genotype, depression, and self-reported symptoms of possible sleep apnea did not modify the observed relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the association between disrupted circadian rest-activity patterns and AD pathophysiological processes may be more evident in cognitively unimpaired males. Our results contribute to the precision medicine approach, and they have clinical implications for improved early detection and selection of at-risk individuals to be enrolled in preventive interventions.",

    "ArticleTitle": "3-N-Butylphthalide alleviate Aβ-induced cellular senescence through the CDK2-pRB1-Caspase3 axis.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and leading to cellular senescence and cognitive deficits. Cellular senescence contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of AD through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), exacerbating Aβ deposition. This study investigates the protective effects of 3-N-Butylphthalide (NBP), a compound derived from Apium graveolens Linn (Chinese celery), on Aβ-induced cellular senescence in U87 cells. Using RNA-sequencing and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that NBP ameliorate Aβ oligomer-induced cellular senescence and apoptosis, and regulated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and components of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)- phosphorylated retinoblastoma 1 (pRB1)-Caspase3 pathway. Moreover, NBP was shown to suppress the expression of SASP-related genes. These findings suggest that NBP rescues U87 cells from Aβ oligomer-induced senescence and apoptosis through modulating the CDK2-pRB1-Caspase3 axis and SASP expression. Our results underscore the potential of NBP as a senostatic agent for AD which have not been reported in previous studies, offering insights into its mechanisms of action and paving the way for future studies on its efficacy in vivo and in clinical settings. Thus, we contribute to growing evidence supporting the use of senolytic and senostatic agents in the treatment of AD.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Maintaining autophagic homeostasis has been proved to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECT: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Fuzhisan(FZS) on autophagic function in Alzheimer's disease and to elucidate its potential mechanism through the P62 regulatory pathways. METHODS: FZS was extracted by water extraction-rotary evaporation method. The novel object recognition test, morris water maze test and Y maze test were used to observe the cognitive and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. The effects of FZS on the ultrastructure of mice hippocampus were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Molecular level changes were also further detected, including Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, SOD, CAT and autophagy related proteins (p62, Nrf2, keap1, mTOR, LC3II/I, Beclin1, Atgs). RESULTS: FZS could alleviate memory and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, increase the autophagic vesicles and organelle abundance in hippocampus. FZS also reduced the levels of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of model mice, upregulated the levels of SOD, CAT and autophagy related proteins (Nrf2, LC3II/LC3I, Beclin1, Atg7 and Atg12) as well as downregulated the expression of P62, keap1 and p-mTOR/mTOR proteins. Co-Ip results showed that FZS elevated the levels of p62/LC3 and P62-keap1-Nrf2 complex, but decreased the P62 and keap1 association. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that FZS may affect autophagy function and oxidative stress by regulating P62 and related pathways to promote the clearance of Aβ and phosphorylated tau, thereby improving the cognitive ability of AD, which provided a novel perspective for exploring the potential mechanism of FZS upon AD.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small brain haemorrhages, identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They indicate potential for cognitive decline and mortality in memory clinic attendees. The presence of more than four CMBs is exclusionary for some clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prevalence and clinical relevance of CMBs in Australian memory clinic populations has not been reported. AIMS: To highlight the prevalence of CMBs in an Australian memory clinic cohort and explore associations with diagnoses, topography and cognitive performance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 393 patients who attended a memory clinic (CDAMS) in Melbourne, Australia from January 2014 to December 2016 who underwent brain MRI. Data collected included age, gender, clinical diagnosis and cognitive scores. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify associations of CMBs with clinical and cognitive findings. RESULTS: The prevalence of CMBs was 27% (n=107) with good inter-rater reliability (κ=0.75). CMBs were significantly associated with increasing age. Prevalence of CMBs was higher in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (32%) and dementia (39%) compared with other diagnostic groups (p<0.001). Lobar-predominant CMB distribution was associated with AD diagnosis. Presence of multiple CMBs was associated with poorer cognitive performance overall. CONCLUSIONS: CMBs are common in an Australian memory clinic population and are associated with poorer cognitive performance. \"Real world\" prevalence of CMBs may limit accessibility to disease-modifying therapies for many people.",

Therefore, this study examined performance of FTD patients with either frontal (F-FTD, left temporal (LT-FTD) or bitemporal lobe atrophy (BT-FTD) on the Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ) and explored what accounts for the variance in the SNQ-break norm subscale (i.e., endorsement of inappropriate behaviors). METHODS: Using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), groups were matched for age and education and included (a) 24 F-FTD patients, (b) 15 LT-FTD patients, (c) 17 BT-FTD patients, and (d) 188 older controls with normal cognition (NC). RESULTS: The BT-FTD group had significantly higher SNQ break norm score than F-FTD and NC groups with a medium effect size, which was also positively associated with the severity personality changes in the real world. Interestingly, the F-FTD and LT-FTD groups performed similarly to the NC group. Regression analysis showed that approximately 21.2% of the variance in SNQ break norms subscale score performance was explained by performance on verb naming. CONCLUSIONS: Social inappropriateness in FTD may partially arise from a deficit in knowledge of normative behavior.",

However, the precise function and molecular mechanism underlying the role of Ub-K48 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuronal cell abnormalities remain unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the function of K48 ubiquitination in the etiology of AD, and its associated mechanism of neuronal apoptosis. METHODS: A mouse model of AD was constructed, and behavioral phenotypic changes were detected using an open field test (OFT). The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an early marker of AD, was detected by western blotting (WB). Neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal region was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to observe the changes in Phosphorylated tubulin associated unit (p-Tau) and Ub-K48 colocalization in neurons of the hippocampal region of AD mice. WB was further applied to detect the degree of ubiquitylation of K48 and the expression of Tau, p-Tau, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) proteins in neuronal cells of the hippocampus and cortical regions of mice. RESULTS: Mice with AD exhibited significantly longer resting times (p < 0.05) and shorter average speeds (p < 0.01), total distances travelled (p < 0.01), and distances travelled (p < 0.01) in the central region than those in the control group. This indicated cognitive impairment, which occurred concurrent with an increased expression of the AD marker GFAP protein (p < 0.001). The hippocampal region of AD mice showed abnormalities with sparsely and irregularly arranged cells, large gaps between cells, lighter staining, unclear boundaries of the cell membranes and nuclei, and agglutinated and condensed nuclei (p < 0.01). The neuronal cells of AD mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of p-Tau (p < 0.01) and Ub-K48 (p < 0.01), as well as a notable degree of co-localization within the cells. The intracellular pro-inflammatory protein Bax was significantly upregulated (p < 0.05), while the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05), thus inducing apoptosis in AD neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: Ub-K48 is strongly linked to the development of AD. p-Tau aggregate in neuronal cells in the hippocampal region of the AD brain and colocalize with Ub-K48, which in turn leads to cellular inflammation and the induction of apoptosis in neuronal cells.",

METHODS: We selected 711 participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which included 195 cases of cognitively normal (CN), 271 cases of early Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (EMCI), 132 cases of late MCI (LMCI), and 113 cases of AD. we looked at how subregion atrophy in the temporal lobe and subcortical nuclei correlated with cognition at different stages of AD. The volume of the subregions was measured from the human Brainnetome atlas (BNA-246) using voxel-based morphometry and discriminant and correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Only the left premotor thalamus demonstrated significant shrinkage in individuals with EMCI (p = 0.012). Discriminant analysis revealed that the left rostral Brodmann area 20 has the highest discriminatory ability among all temporal subregions to distinguish patients with AD from CN. While the left caudal hippocampus can efficiently distinguish patients with LMCI from EMCI. While the right rostral Brodmann area 20 was the most effective in distinguishing AD from LMCI. Correlation analysis revealed that the left nucleus accumbens, left caudal area 35/36, and left sensory thalamus had a mild correlation with cognitive scores measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) 13 and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the right rostral area 20 in the inferior temporal gyrus plays a significant role in cognitive impairment in AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurological disorder, is one of the major reasons for memory loss in the world. AD is characterized by a sequela of cognitive and functional decline caused by brain cell degeneration. Paeoniflorin is a monoterpenoid glycoside found in plants of the Paeoniaceae family, which are known for their medicinal properties including dementia. In this project, we report actions of paeoniflorin on the two related cholinesterases (ChE): acetylChE (AChE) and butyrylChE (BuChE). Paeoniflorin, in a dose-dependent (maximum inhibition at 1 mg/mL) manner, inhibited both AChE (0.06-1 mg/mL) and BuChE (0.007-1 mg/mL) enzymes with maximum inhibition of AChE enzyme at 90.3 ± 1.4%, while 99.4 ± 0.3% for BuChE enzyme. The EC50 value for the inhibitory effect of the compound against AChE was 0.52 mg/mL (0.18-1.52), while against BuChE was 0.13 mg/mL (0.08-0.21). The observed ani-ChE action was like an effect also mediated by the known ChE blocker physostigmine. Molecular interactions between paeoniflorin and both ChE enzymes were additionally sought via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations for 100 ns, that showed paeoniflorin interacted with the active-site gorge of AChE and BuChE via hydrogen bonds and water bridging with the many amino acids of the AChE and BuChE enzymes. This study presents the ChE inhibitory potential of paeoniflorin against both AChE and BuChE enzymes. With this kind of inhibitory activity, the chemical can potentially increase ACh levels and may have use in the treatment of dementia of AD.",

It is an intricate network of synergistic molecular pathways that exert their effects far beyond their local vicinity and even affect the systemic functioning of the body. The current review explores the involvement of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in the functioning of the nervous system, with a special emphasis on the neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and neuroinflammation that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Gut-derived microbial metabolites play an important role in facilitating this interaction. We also highlighted the complex interaction between gut-derived metabolites and CNS processes, demonstrating how microbial dysbiosis might result in clinical disorders. Short-chain fatty acids have neuroprotective properties, whereas branched-chain amino acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and tryptophan derivatives such as indole have negative effects at high concentrations. Furthermore, we cover pharmaceutical and nonpharmacological approaches for restoring the gut microbial balance and promoting neurological health. We further expanded on nutritional therapies and lifestyle changes, such as the Mediterranean diet and exercise. Next, we focused on food-controlling habits such as caloric restriction and intermittent fasting. Moreover, interventional techniques such as prebiotics, probiotics, and pharmacological medications have also been utilized to modify the GBA.

    "AbstractText": "Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high-temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a methodology to overcome these problems called filter average short-term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, a long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of visual short-term memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyze the transient high-temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy event-related potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyze an activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.",

    "AbstractText": "Hub regions in the brain, recognized for their roles in ensuring efficient information transfer, are vulnerable to pathological alterations in neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Computational simulations and animal experiments have hinted at the theory of activity-dependent degeneration as the cause of this hub vulnerability. However, two critical issues remain unresolved. First, past research has not clearly distinguished between two scenarios: hub regions facing a higher risk of connectivity disruption (targeted attack) and all regions having an equal risk (random attack). Second, human studies offering support for activity-dependent explanations remain scarce. We refined the hub disruption index to demonstrate a hub disruption pattern in functional connectivity in autosomal dominant AD that aligned with targeted attacks. This hub disruption is detectable even in preclinical stages, 12 years before the expected symptom onset and is amplified alongside symptomatic progression. Moreover, hub disruption was primarily tied to regional differences in global connectivity and sequentially followed changes observed in amyloid-beta positron emission tomography cortical markers, consistent with the activity-dependent degeneration explanation. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of brain network organization in neurodegenerative diseases and could be instrumental in refining diagnostic and targeted therapeutic strategies for AD in the future.",

    "AbstractText": "Neurological disorders encompass a complex and heterogeneous spectrum of diseases affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system, each presenting unique challenges that extend well beyond primary neurological symptoms. These disorders profoundly impact cardiovascular health, prompting an intensified exploration into the intricate interconnections between the neurological and cardiovascular systems. This review synthesizes current insights and research on cardiovascular comorbidities associated with major neurological conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. The cardiovascular sequelae of these neurological disorders are multifactorial. For instance, strokes not only predispose individuals to arrhythmia and heart failure but also exacerbate preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Similarly, epilepsy is associated with autonomic dysregulation and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death, underscoring the necessity for vigilant cardiac monitoring in affected individuals. Parkinson's disease manifests with orthostatic hypotension and cardiac sympathetic denervation, significantly contributing to morbidity. Additionally, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease exhibit cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heightened cardiovascular risk, underscoring the need for proactive management strategies. Mechanistically, these conditions disrupt autonomic nervous system regulation, induce chronic inflammation, and may share genetic susceptibilities, each contributing to cardiovascular pathology. Effective management of these complexities requires an integrative approach that includes risk factor modification, pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions, and comprehensive patient education. Future research directions include identifying novel therapeutic targets, conducting large-scale clinical trials, and investigating genetic biomarkers to individualize treatment strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) are common causes of cognitive impairment and may share many similarities in ocular signs. Multimodal ophthalmic imaging is a technology to quantify pupillary light reaction, retinal reflectance spectrum, and hemodynamics. This provides multidimensional ocular metrics from a non-invasive approach to ocular biomarkers and differential diagnosis of AD and VCI. AIM: We aim to investigate the changing pattern of ocular metrics in patients with AD and VCI using multimodal ophthalmic imaging. APPROACH: Patients with subjective cognitive complaints in the memory clinic were subdivided into AD, VCI, and cognitively healthy individuals using neuropsychological and neuroimaging examinations, including positron emission tomography. All subjects underwent a medical history review, blood pressure measurement, medical optometry, intraocular pressure measurement, and custom-built multimodal ophthalmic imaging. Multidimensional parameters were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons. RESULTS: This study included 19 patients with AD, 24 patients with VCI, and 37 cognitively healthy age- and sex-matched subjects. Both AD and VCI patients showed abnormal pupillary light reactions, including decreased resting pupil diameter, pupil constriction amplitude, and maximum constriction velocity. Compared with the control group, the AD group presented increased retinal reflectance at 548 nm, whereas the VCI group presented an increased resistivity index and decreased blowout score in retinal hemodynamics. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that pupillary light reaction-related neurodegeneration is the common pathological change in both AD and VCI. In addition, AD is characterized by alterations in retinal spectral signatures, whereas VCI is characterized by alterations in retinal hemodynamics. These findings suggest that multimodal ophthalmic imaging may have the potential to be used as a screening tool for detecting AD and VCI.",

This study aimed to investigate whether AD patients with sleep disorders exhibit worse glymphatic function and more severe cognitive impairment compared to those without sleep disorders and to explore the underlying molecular imaging mechanisms. METHODS: This study included 40 AD patients with sleep disorders (ADSD), 39 cognitively matched AD patients without sleep disorders (ADNSD), and 25 healthy middle-aged and elderly controls (NC). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and cognitive and sleep assessments. The ALPS (Along the Perivascular Space) index was calculated, followed by intergroup comparisons, correlation analyses, and mediation analyses. The diagnostic utility of the ALPS index was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The ALPS index was lower in the ADNSD and ADSD groups compared to the NC group. In the ADSD group, PSQI scores were negatively correlated with MMSE scores. The ALPS index was positively correlated with MMSE scores and negatively with PSQI scores. Mediation analyses indicated that the ALPS index partially mediated the effect of sleep disturbances on cognitive impairment (indirect effect = -0.134; mediation effect = 30.505%). The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for distinguishing ADSD from ADNSD was 0.86, with a cutoff ALPS index value 1.309.

Our work identifies diffusion as the principal mechanism for amyloid-β proteins clearance, whereas fluid advection may lead transport for larger molecular bodies, like amyloid-β aggregates or extracellular vesicles. We also clearly quantify the impact of large nascent prefibrils on the fluid flowing and shearing. Finally, we show that, even in the irregular brain interstitial space (ISS), hydrodynamic interactions enhance amyloid-β aggregation at all stages of the aggregation pathway.

Dysbiosis may influence neurodegeneration by affecting gut permeability and neurotrophic factors, leading to cognitive decline. The study analyzed microbiome differences between patients with AD and healthy individuals, as well as the impact of various interventions in both preclinical and clinical studies. Of 60 studies reviewed, 12 were excluded from the meta-analysis due to unsuitable data or lack of control groups. Meta-analyses revealed significant cognitive impairment in AD patients and animal models, with specific tests identifying these deficits. Notably, Bacteroides levels were higher in patients with AD, whereas probiotics improved Prevotella levels. Natural treatments increased Bacteroidetes and reduced Firmicutes in animal models. The findings emphasize the need for standardized methods to develop therapies targeting the gut microbiota to restore cognition in AD. Understanding individual dysbiosis could further clarify the cognitive effects of the gut-brain axis.

    "ArticleTitle": "Andrographolide mitigates neurotoxicity induced by lipopolysaccharide or amyloid-β through modulation of miR-222-mediated p62 and NF-κBp65 expression.",
    "AbstractText": "MicroRNA-222 (miR-222) plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration and is up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Andrographolide (Andro) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, showing potential for treating AD. The relationship between Andro's anti-AD mechanism and the regulation of miR-222 was discussed in this study. Andro protected against cytotoxicity induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-β, accompanied by upregulating p62 and Nrf2 mRNA and protein, downregulating TLR4 and NF-κBp65 mRNA and protein, and increasing LC3Ⅱ protein in vitro. miRNA and mRNA sequencing results showed that Andro downregulated miR-222 and upregulated sqstm1/p62. Andro was observed to inhibit the expression of miR-222 and the phosphorylation of NF-κBp65, while simultaneously enhancing the levels of p62 and LC3Ⅱ proteins, decreasing Aβ levels, and attenuating the release of inflammatory factors in the 3xTg-AD mice. MiR-222 mimic increased NF-κBp65 mRNA and protein levels in LPS-induced cells, while miR-222 inhibitors increased p62 mRNA and protein levels as well as Nrf2 and LC3Ⅱ protein, and decreased p-NF-κBp65 protein level in LPS-induced cells. Furthermore, miR-222 mimic reversed the increase in p62 and LC3Ⅱ protein and the decrease in NF-κBp65 mRNA and protein, as well as the decrease in Tau protein levels induced by Andro in LPS-induced cells. These findings suggest that Andro plays a neuroprotective role through downregulation of miR-222 to promote p62 expression while inhibiting NF-kB p65 expression, providing new insights into the mechanism of action of Andro for treating AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) plays a pivotal role in regulating acetylcholine (ACh) levels during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), so emerged as an attractive target in AD treatment. Vasicine, a naturally occurring pyrroloquinazoline alkaloid, was identified as a natural BChE inhibitor (IC50 = 1.47 ± 0.37 μM) from Traditional Chinese Medicine database. No any detailed research concerning the binding behavior of BChE with small molecule. As the first case, the inhibitory mechanism of vasicine on BChE was investigated using multi-spectroscopic methods (including fluorescence quenching, ANS fluorescence probe, three-dimensional fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism), isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, and computational approaches. As a reversible and mixed inhibitor, vasicine displayed moderate affinity for BChE with an affinity constant KD of 2.111 μM, its binding process was characterized as a spontaneous exothermic reaction with reduced entropy, primarily driven by hydrogen bonding interactions. Vasicine quenched the fluorescence of BChE through both static and dynamic quenching mechanisms, leading to an increase in the α-helix content and surface hydrophobicity of BChE. Furthermore, the fluctuation of the skeleton atoms in the vasicine-BChE complex system remained stable, indicating good stability within the simulated physiological environment. In addition, vasicine exerted good safety for PC12 cells. Above findings provide molecular insights into the inhibitory mechanism of vasicine against BChE for the first time, and offer valuable information for future structure modification and therapeutic applications of vasicine as a BChE inhibitor.",

    "AbstractText": "Essential hypertension (EH) with secondary insomnia is associated with increased risks of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its relationship with specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation remains unclear. This case-control study compared CSF biomarker levels across three groups: healthy controls (HC, n = 64), hypertension-controlled (HTN-C, n = 54), and hypertension-uncontrolled (HTN-U, n = 107) groups, all EH participants experiencing secondary insomnia. CSF samples from knee replacement patients were analyzed for key biomarkers, and sleep quality was assessed via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Our findings showed that the HTN-U group had significantly higher CSF levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17 than the HC and HTN-C groups (all p < 0.01). These cytokines correlated positively with secondary insomnia measures, with IL-6 (r = 0.285, p = 0.003), IL-17 (r = 0.324, p = 0.001), and TNF-α (r = 0.274, p = 0.005) linked to PSQI scores. In the HTN-U group, elevated IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17 levels were also positively associated with neurofilament light (NF-L) and negatively with β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42), both key AD markers (all p < 0.05). Additionally, secondary insomnia was negatively correlated with Aβ42 (r = -0.225, p = 0.021) and positively with NF-L (r = 0.261, p = 0.007). Higher CSF palmitic acid (PA) levels observed in the HTN-U group were linked to poorer sleep quality (r = 0.208, p = 0.033). In conclusion, EH with secondary insomnia is associated with CSF biomarkers of neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, suggesting a potential increase in AD risk among this population.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of dementia globally, represents an unresolved clinical challenge due to its complex pathogenesis and the absence of effective treatments. Considering the multifactorial etiology of the disease, mainly characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein, we discuss the A673V mutation in the gene coding for the amyloid precursor protein, which is associated with the familial form of Alzheimer's disease in a homozygous state. The mutation offers new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease, particularly regarding the contrasting roles of the A2V and A2T mutations in amyloid β peptide aggregation and toxicity. This review aims to describe relevant studies on A2V-mutated variants of the amyloid β peptide, revealing a protective effect against amyloid-β and tau pathology. Notably, special attention is given to the development of the peptide Aβ1-6A2V(D), which shows significant neuroprotective activity through inhibition of the assembly of amyloid β into amyloid fibrils. The therapeutic potential of this peptide emerges from its ability to reduce amyloid β-induced toxicity, with promising results from studies in human neuroblastoma cells and transgenic animal models.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A New Approach for Assessing the Value of Informal Care in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: Given that most informal caregivers providing help for patients with Alzheimer's disease are retired spouses or unemployed people, there is no market value for their time. Most articles that tried to estimate the cost of informal care for Alzheimer's disease rely on the so-called \"replacement\" methodology, which assumes that 1 hour of informal care has the same value as 1 hour of professional care. Little attention has been dedicated to exploring the validity of this assumption. In this article, we determine the relationship between the price of informal caregiving and professional care from the first-order condition of a theoretical model that maximizes informal caregivers' satisfaction with providing care. METHODS: This article formalizes the marginal substitution rate between informal and formal care. We assume that the caregiver's utility depends on the caregiver's burden and the patient's quality of life (QoL). After explaining the parameters of the marginal utility of caregivers, we estimate each of these parameters using PLASA data. RESULTS: Our results show how the value of informal care increases as the care contributes to improving patients' QoL but decreases as the burden on the caregiver increases and professionals contribute to patients' QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The central assumption of the replacement cost method of perfect substitution between informal and formal care leads to a misestimation of the value of informal care. The effects of informal care must be considered (direct effect on the burden and indirect effects on the patient's QoL).",

    "ArticleTitle": "The Excess Direct Social Costs of Dementia-Related Neuropsychiatric Symptoms: A Regionwide Cohort Study Beyond Silos.",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVES: To estimate the excess formal social costs or direct non-healthcare costs of dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). METHODS: The presence of dementia, NPS, antipsychotic and antidepressant use, somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, and formal social benefits were studied in a regionwide cohort of all 60-year-old and older individuals. A random forest-based algorithm identified NPS, and 2-part regression models and entropy balance were used. RESULTS: Of the 215 859 individuals, 7553 (3.50%) had dementia, 74 845 (34.7%) had some NPS, and 20 787 (9.63%) received long-term care benefits. Notably, nearly two-thirds (63.9%) of people with dementia received benefits. The probability of having social costs varied markedly with age (odds ratio [OR] 12.28 [10.17-14.82] for >90-year-olds category), and the presence of dementia (OR 7.36 [6.13-8.84]) or NPS (OR 3.23 [2.69-3.88]). NPS (relative change [RC] 1.39 [1.31-1.49]) and dementia (RC 1.32 [1.24-1.41]) were associated with higher average benefit costs. Low socioeconomic status was significantly associated with both a higher probability of receiving benefits (OR 1.52 [1.38-1.68]) and higher costs of their provision (RC 1.18 [1.15-1.21]). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of caring for NPS is greater than that indicated by the literature as these symptoms multiply the social costs of dementia by more than 3, owing to the greater use of residential care and formal coverage reaching more patients than that indicated by the literature. The greater presence of dementia and NPS in the population of lower socioeconomic status indicates an inequality in health attenuated by greater use of social benefits.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Rg1 improves Alzheimer's disease by regulating mitochondrial dynamics mediated by the AMPK/Drp1 signaling pathway.",
    "AbstractText": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, characterized by a complex pathogenesis that includes Aβ deposition, abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein, chronic neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In traditional medicine, ginseng is revered as the 'king of herbs'. Ginseng has the effects of greatly tonifying vital energy, strengthening the spleen and benefiting the lungs, generating fluids and nourishing the blood, and calming the mind while enhancing intelligence. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is a well-defined major active component found in ginseng, known for its relatively high content. It has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective effects in both in vivo and in vitro models, capable of ameliorating Aβ and tau pathology, regulating synaptic function, and reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. However, the potential of Rg1 to improve AD pathology through the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is still uncertain. AIM OF THE STUDY: Despite the active research efforts on drugs for AD, the currently available anti-AD medications can only slow disease progression and manage symptoms, yet unable to provide a cure for AD. Furthermore, some anti-AD drugs failed phase III and IV clinical trials due to significant side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further investigate the pathogenesis of AD, to identify new therapeutic targets, and to explore more effective therapies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of Rg1 on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and Aβ42-induced HT22 cell models, and to investigate the potential mechanisms through which it provides neuroprotective effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigates the effects of Rg1 in treating AD on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and Aβ42-induced HT22 cells. In the in vivo experiments, APP/PS1 mice were divided into a model group, Rg1-L group, Rg1-H group, and donepezil group, with C57BL/6 mice serving as the control group (n = 12 per group). The Rg1-L and Rg1-H groups were administered Rg1 at doses of 5 mg/kg/d and 10 mg/kg/d, respectively, while the donepezil group received donepezil at a dose of 1.3 mg/kg/d. Both the control and model groups received an equal volume of physiological saline daily for 28 days. Learning and spatial memory were assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests, and neuronal damage by Nissl staining. Aβ deposition was analyzed through immunohistochemistry and Western blot, while the expression levels of synaptic proteins PSD95 and SYN were evaluated via immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. The dendritic spines of neurons was observed by Golgi staining.The ultrastructure of neuronal mitochondria and synapses was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial function was assessed through measurements of Reactive oxygen species (ROS), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), and Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of AMPK, p-AMPK, Drp1, p-Drp1, OPA1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, thereby investigating the protective effects of Rg1 on mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. In vitro experiments, HT22 cells were treated with Aβ42 of 10 μM for 24 h to verify the therapeutic effects of Rg1. Flow cytometry was used to detect ROS and JC-1, biochemical methods were employed to measure SOD and ATP, immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression levels of PSD95 and SYN, and Western blot analysis was conducted to elucidate its potential mechanisms of action. RESULTS: The findings suggest that after 28 days of Rg1 treatment, cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice was improved. Pathological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that Rg1 treatment significantly reduced Aβ deposition and neuronal loss. Rg1 can improve synaptic dysfunction and mitochondrial function in APP/PS1 mice. Rg1 activated AMPK, enhanced p-AMPK expression, inhibited Drp1, and reduced p-Drp1 levels, which led to increased expression of OPA1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial fission and facilitating mitochondrial fusion. Additionally, Rg1 effectively reversed the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the increase in ROS production induced by Aβ42 in HT22 cells, restoring SOD and ATP levels. Furthermore, Rg1 regulated mitochondrial fission mediated by the AMPK/Drp1 signaling pathway, promoting mitochondrial fusion and improving synaptic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our research provides evidence for the neuroprotective mechanisms of Rg1 in AD models. Rg1 modulates mitochondrial dynamics through the AMPK/Drp1 signaling pathway, thereby reducing synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice and AD cell models.",

    "AbstractText": "Curcumin has been proposed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its ability to inhibit amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide aggregates and to destabilise pre-formed ones. Derivative 27 was synthesized to improve low-dose efficacy in the context of AD. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-amyloidogenic activities were evaluated in chemico, in vitro using AD and neuroinflammation cell models, and in vivo using the double-transgenic APP/PS1 mice. In vitro, this curcumin derivative significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) production and levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, inducible NO synthase, pro-interleukin-1β (Pro-IL-1β) and cyclooxygenase-2. Furthermore, Derivative 27 activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 transcription factor (Nrf2) and significantly increased Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase-1 protein levels in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, respectively. In one-year-old APP/PS1 mice, orally administered-Derivative 27 (50 mg/Kg/day) for 28 days improved spatial short-term memory and significantly decreased hippocampal Pro-IL-1β and amyloid precursor protein levels, as well as Aβ levels in the hippocampus and plasma. This study supports developing new chemical approaches to alter curcumin molecule, enabling lower doses, while increasing the effectiveness in AD treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Evidence on antidementia drugs (ADD) use in developing countries, where accessibility to ADD is challenging, is limited. Our aim was to examine prescribing patterns, factors, and outcomes associated with the early-ADD use (within 3 months from diagnosis) in people with dementia. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study included individuals aged ≥ 60 years with dementia from three hospitals in Thailand between 2015 and 2020. Participants were categorized as non-ADD users, early-ADD users, and delayed users. ADD switching and one-year persistence were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with early-ADD prescribing and its impact on clinical outcomes, including in-hospital death and hospitalization. RESULTS: 3,116 patients were included. The ADD prescription rate was 14.31 %, with 79.82 % of those being early-ADD users. Donepezil was the most prescribed (70.18 %). The one-year persistence rate of any ADD was 24.89 %. Factors associated with early-ADD use included the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, dyslipidemia, and dementia type. Early-ADD use was associated with reduced in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.46, 95 % CI: 0.22-0.96, p = 0.038) and hospitalization (adjusted OR = 0.70 95 % CI: 0.51-0.97, p = 0.034) after controlling for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. CONCLUSION: ADD prescription rates were relatively low, with a one-year persistence rate of 25 %. Early-ADD use may improve clinical outcomes by reducing hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. These findings provide clinical features of ADD used in real-world settings and highlight the need for adherence to practice standards and strategies to promote ADD persistence among individuals with dementia.",

Chronic inflammatory processes are also involved in its the etiology, as the consequence or cause of proteinopathy (amyloid and tau load in the brain). This study aimed to investigate the complete blood count and systemic inflammation indices in 61 individuals with AD, compared to 59 cognitively healthy individuals as controls. The diagnosis of AD dementia was based on the NIA-AA criteria and patients presented biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid compatible with the diagnosis of AD. The complete blood count (CBC) was conducted using an automated system. The neutrophil count (p = 0.011), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.023), and Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI) (p = 0.044) were significantly higher, whereas the lymphocyte count (p = 0.018) and platelet count (p = 0.038) were significantly lower in the AD group compared to the control group. After a multivariategeneralized linear model analyses, neutrophils count and SIRI maintained significant difference between the groups, even after correcting for age, sex, body mass index and ApoE ε4 carrier status. The overall results suggest that AD is associated with a low-grade pro-inflammatory profile, characterized by alterations in blood inflammatory and immune cells, leading to a higher systemic inflammatory index. The CBC and its derived inflammatory indices, routinely obtained in clinical practice, have potential utility in the context of AD.",

Further studies revealed that C2 possessed significant abilities to protect PC12 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The acute toxicity test in vivo indicated that C2 exhibited a remarkable safety profile. Whether in the acute memory impairment induced by the Aβ1-42 model or in the amnesia induced by the scopolamine model, oral administration of C2 demonstrated superior improvement on cognition and spatial memory.

However, studies on the relationship between BACE1 gene polymorphism (rs638405), brain volume, and cognition in AD patients remain scarce. To investigate the effect of genetic polymorphism in BACE1 on gray matter volume (GMV) and cognition in AD, this study recruited 111 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls and 144 AD patients. The effect of BACE1 rs638405 polymorphism on cognition was explored in CU and AD groups. Then the interaction effect of the diagnosis and BACE1 rs638405 polymorphism on GMV was performed, following the post-hoc analysis of regions of interest (ROIs) in interaction analysis. Mediation analysis was used to elucidate the relationship among genotypes, ROIs and cognition. BACE1 rs638405 G carriers (BACE1 G+) showed significantly lower scores in global cognition and memory function than noncarriers (BACE1 G-) in AD group. Genotypes (G+/G-) and diagnosis (CU/AD) have interaction on GMV of medial temporal lobe (MTL) including the left parahippocampus and right hippocampus. Post-hoc analysis revealed that BACE1 G+ exhibited significantly lower GMV in ROIs compared to BACE1 G- in AD. Finally, mediation analysis further demonstrated that the GMV of ROIs mediated the effect of BACE1 rs638405 polymorphism on cognition in AD.

Studying the pathogenesis of AD and exploring new targets for the prevention and treatment of AD is a very worthwhile challenge. Accumulating evidence has highlighted the effects of fatty acid metabolism on AD. In this study, fatty acid metabolism was used as an entry point to understand the pathogenesis of AD and identify new targets. After identifying differentially expressed genes, multiple machine learning algorithms, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 A (CPT1A) was identified as the key gene for fatty acid metabolism in AD. Further single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis were performed, and the GSEA results showed that the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway was enriched only in astrocytes, and the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway was down-regulated in the AD astrocytes compared to the CN astrocytes, while CPT1A was specifically downregulated in astrocytes of AD, which was confirmed in vitro experiment subsequently, and decreased expression level of CPT1A would lead to abnormal lipid metabolism, which shapes astrocyte reactivity and injury, neuroinflammatory, and thus affects AD pathogenesis. Our findings report the involvement of CPT1A in AD. We confirm that the primary role of astrocytes for fatty acid β-oxidation, and CPT1A is localized in astrocytes. Downregulated CPT1A could be a novel potential target for the prevention and treatment of AD.

    "AbstractText": "Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal structures essential for cell architecture, cellular transport, cell motility, and cell division. Due to their dynamic nature, known as dynamic instability, microtubules can spontaneously switch between phases of growth and shortening. Disruptions in microtubule functions have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and birth defects. The role of microtubules during various phases of the cell cycle, particularly in cell division, makes them attractive targets for drug development against cancer. Several successful drugs currently on the market are designed to target microtubules. However, the presence of cellular toxicity and the development of multidrug resistance necessitate the search for new microtubule-targeting drugs.Here, a library of 106 biologically active compounds were screened to identify potent microtubule assembly inhibitors. Out of all the screened compounds, the hydroxyethylamine (HEA) analogues are found to be the best hit.We identified three inhibitors, BKS3031A, BKS3045A and BKS3046A, that bind at the same site as the well-known microtubule targeting agent colchicine. These inhibitors were simulated for 100 ns with tubulin complexes, and the results indicated that they remain stable within the binding pocket of α-β tubulin complexes. In addition, we estimated the binding free energy of BKS3031A, BKS3045A and BKS3046A by using molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations, and it was found to be -32.67 ± 6.01, -21.77 ± 5.12 and - 22.92 ± 5.09 kcal/mol, respectively. Our findings suggest that these novel inhibitors have potential to bind and perturb the microtubule network, positioning them as promising microtubule-targeting agents.",

A four-class machine-learning algorithm was trained using age and nine sleep biomarkers from patients with clinically-diagnosed manifest and prodromal NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD = 27), Lewy body dementia (LBD = 18), and isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD = 15), as well as a control group (CG = 58). The algorithm was validated in a total of 381 recordings, which included the training data set plus an additional AD = 10, iRBD = 18, Parkinson disease without dementia (PD = 29), mild cognitive impairment (MCI = 78) and CG = 128. Test-retest consistency was then assessed in LBD = 10, AD = 9, and CG = 46. The agreement between the NDD profiles and their respective clinical diagnoses exceeded 75% for the AD, LBD, and CG, and improved when NDD participants classified Likely Normal with NDD indications consistent with their clinical diagnosis were considered. Profiles for iRBD, PD and MCI participants were consistent with the heterogeneity of disease severities, with the majority of overt disagreements explained by normal sleep characterization in 27% of iRBD, 21% of PD, and 26% of MCI participants. For test-retest assignments, the same or similar NDD profiles were obtained for 88% of LBD, 86% in AD, and 98% of CG participants. The potential utility for NDD subtyping based on sleep biomarkers demonstrates promise and requires further prospective development and validation in larger NDD cohorts.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative illness that accounts for the common type of dementia among adults over the age of 65. Despite extensive studies on the pathogenesis of the disease, early diagnosis of AD is still debatable. In this research, we performed bioinformatics approaches on the AD-related E-MTAB 6094 dataset to uncover new potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis. To achieve this, we performed in-depth in silico assays, including differentially expressed genes analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analyses, module-trait association analyses, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, and hub genes network analyses. Finally, the expression of the identified candidate genes was evaluated in AD patients PBMC samples by qRT-PCR. Through computational analyses, we found that RN7SK LncRNA and its co-expressed genes of TNF, TNFAIP3, CCLT3, and FLT3 are from key genes in AD development that are associated with inflammatory responses. Our experimental validation revealed that RN7SK LncRNA and TNF were substantially up-regulated in AD samples (P = 0.006 and P = 0.023, respectively). Whereas, TNFAIP3 expression was significantly decreased (P = 0.016). However, the expression of CCL3 and FLT3 did not differ significantly between two groups (P = 0.396 and P = 0.521, respectively). In conclusion, in this study a novel LncRNA associated with AD pathogenesis were identified, which may provide new diagnostic biomarker for AD.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The choroid plexus (CP) may play a crucial role in brain degeneration. We aim to assess whether CP cysts (CPCs), defined using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relate to aging and neurodegeneration. METHODS: We used multi-sequence 7T MRI to observe CPCs, characterizing their presence and characteristics in healthy younger controls, healthy older controls (OCs), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and patients with uremic encephalopathy. CP volume (CPV) and CPC characteristics were compared across groups, and associations between CPV and CPC features were analyzed across all subjects. RESULTS: The AD group showed a significantly higher presence and number of CPCs compared to other groups and also had a significantly larger CPV than healthy OCs. The number and size of CPCs were associated with CPV. DISCUSSION: 7T MRI offers a distinct advantage in observing CPCs, and the high prevalence of CPCs in patients with AD warrants further investigation. HIGHLIGHTS: 7T MRI enables visualization of the fine structures of the choroid plexus. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a higher number of choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) compared to healthy older adults and other patient groups.

Insulin signaling dysfunction exacerbates tau protein phosphorylation, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, the comprehensive impact of diabetes on patterns of AD-related phosphoprotein in the human brain remains underexplored. METHODS: We performed tandem mass tag-based phosphoproteome profiling in post mortem human brain prefrontal cortex samples from 191 deceased older adults with and without diabetes and pathologic AD. RESULTS: Among 7874 quantified phosphosites, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) phosphorylated at T529 and T534 (isoform 8 T212 and T217) were more abundant in AD and showed differential associations with diabetes. Network analysis of co-abundance patterns uncovered synergistic interactions between AD and diabetes, with one module exhibiting higher MAPT phosphorylation (15 MAPT phosphosites) and another displaying lower MAP1B phosphorylation (22 MAP1B phosphosites). DISCUSSION: This study offers phosphoproteomics insights into AD in diabetes, shedding light on mechanisms that can inform the development of therapeutics for dementia.

We investigated cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories in SCD over 24 months based on biomarker positivity, and evaluated the predictive value of plasma biomarkers. METHODS: The CoSCo prospective cohort included older adults with SCD. Participants were categorized into high- and low-risk groups based on plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ] 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to compare outcomes. RESULTS: High-risk SCDs (n = 23, 23%) revealed greater decline in general cognition, memory recall, frontal function, and hippocampal volumes compared to low-risk SCDs. Combined scores of plasma and MRIs yielded the best predictions compared with other biomarker categories. DISCUSSION: SCD participants with high-risk experience faster cognitive and neurodegenerative declines. A combination of plasma biomarkers and MRIs could be used for screening and prognosis. HIGHLIGHTS: This is part of a multicenter prospective cohort study in Korea. We investigated cognitive and atrophic trajectories in SCD over 24 months. High risk SCDs revealed greater cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy. Integration of plasma and MRIs yielded better predictions than other categories.

METHODS: NPSs and cognition were assessed annually in participants (DLB n = 222; Alzheimer's disease [AD] n = 125) from the European DLB (E-DLB) Consortium, and plasma phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) and p-tau231 concentrations were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Hallucinations, delusions, and depression were more common in DLB than in AD and, in a subgroup with longitudinal follow-up, persistent hallucinations and NPSs were associated with lower p-tau181 and p-tau231 in DLB. In adjusted linear mixed-effects models, hallucinations at baseline were associated with greater longitudinal cognitive impairment in DLB, with a significant interaction with p-tau231. DISCUSSION: Higher p-tau181 and p-tau231 levels were associated with a lower longitudinal risk of NPSs and hallucinations in early-stage DLB. However, the interaction between hallucinations and p-tau231 suggests that when AD co-pathology and hallucinations do co-exist in DLB that they may synergistically exacerbate cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) were more common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower plasma phosphorylated tau-231 (p-tau231) and p-tau181 levels were associated with persistent hallucinations in DLB.

Considering associative memory deficits may reflect early signs of AD, we studied how BSO affected brain activity underlying associative memory. METHODS: Early midlife women with BSO (with and without 17β-estradiol therapy [ET]) and age-matched controls (AMCs) with intact ovaries completed a face-name associative memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Hippocampal activity along the anteroposterior axis during associative encoding and retrieval was compared among three groups (BSO [n = 28], BSO+ET [n = 35], AMCs [n = 40]). RESULTS: Both BSO groups (with and without ET) showed lower posterior hippocampal activation during encoding compared to the AMC group. However, this difference in activation was not significantly correlated with associative memory task performance. DISCUSSION: Early 17β-estradiol loss may influence posterior hippocampal activity during associative encoding, possibly presaging late-life AD. HIGHLIGHTS: After ovarian removal, changes in hippocampal function may affect dementia risk. Midlife ovarian removal is associated with less activation in the posterior hippocampus. Estradiol therapy may ameliorate alterations in brain function during learning.",

METHODS: Thirty patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 26 healthy controls underwent cognitive evaluations and tau, synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), and amyloid positron emission tomography. Twenty-one aMCI underwent 2-year follow-up (FU) investigations. RESULTS: Tau levels in aMCI increased longitudinally in Braak regions III through VI but not in Braak regions I and II. SV2A decreased longitudinally in all Braak regions in aMCI. Baseline tau was negatively associated with longitudinal SV2A loss in early Braak regions and with SV2A at FU across regions. Baseline tau and longitudinal change in SV2A were associated with longitudinal cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Tau accumulation reaches a plateau in early Braak regions already in the aMCI stage of AD. In early Braak regions, the association between baseline tau and longitudinal SV2A loss might reflect synaptic dysfunction caused by tau pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Tau accumulation reached a plateau in early Braak regions in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. aMCI patients show widespread longitudinal decrease in synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) over 2 years. Baseline tau was predictive for longitudinal SV2A loss. The tau-SV2A relation showed individual variability and was negative across patients.

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, phosphorylated tau tangles and microglia toxicity, resulting in neuronal death and cognitive decline. Since microglia are recognized as one of the key players in the disease, it is crucial to understand how microglia operate in disease conditions and incorporate them into models. The studies on human microglia functions are thought to reflect the post-symptomatic stage of the disease. Recently developed methods involve induced microglia-like cells (iMGs) generated from patients' blood monocytes or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as an alternative to studying the microglia cells in vitro. In this research, we aimed to investigate the phenotype and inflammatory responses of iMGs from AD patients. Monocytes derived from blood using density gradient centrifugation were differentiated into iMGs using a cytokine cocktail, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-34 (IL-34). After differentiation, cells were assessed by morphological analysis and a microglia surface marker, TMEM119. We used stimulants, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-amyloid, to examine iMGs' functions. Results showed that iMGs derived from AD patients exhibited increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, their phagocytic ability was also heightened in stimulated and unstimulated conditions, with cells derived from patients showing increased phagocytic activity compared to healthy controls. Overall, these findings suggest that iMGs derived from patients using the direct conversion method possess characteristics of human microglia, making them an easy and promising model for studying microglia function in AD.",

Traditionally, it is believed that neurons encode and communicate information via electrochemical impulses, generating electromagnetic fields detectable by EEG and MEG. Recent discoveries indicate that neurons may also emit biophotons, suggesting an additional communication channel alongside the regular synaptic interactions. This dual signaling system is analyzed for its potential in synchronizing neuronal activity and improving information transfer, with implications for brain-like computing systems. The clinical relevance is explored through the lens of neurodegenerative diseases and intrinsically disordered proteins, where oxidative stress may alter biophoton emission, offering clues for pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The potential therapeutic use of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is also examined for its ability to modulate biophoton activity and mitigate oxidative stress, presenting new opportunities for treatment.

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is significantly characterized by cognitive and memory impairments, which worsen significantly with age. In the late stages of AD, metal ion disorders and an imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels occur in the brain microenvironment, which causes abnormal aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ), leading to a significant worsening of the AD symptoms. Therefore, we designed a composite nanomaterial of macrophage membranes-encapsulated Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs/MM). Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) are capable of chelating Cu2+ and reducing ROS. Macrophage membranes (MM) have advantages over liposomal and erythrocyte membrane carriers, including inflammatory targeting capabilities and more effective immune evasion. Concurrently, the excellent photothermal ability of PB NPs can briefly open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under near-infrared laser irradiation, which improves the transport efficiency of PB NPs/MM across the BBB and ablates Aβ deposition, thus achieving optimal therapeutic efficacy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PB NPs/MM is a multifunctional nanosystem, which can effectively inhibit Cu2+-induced Aβ monomers aggregation, photothermally depolymerize Aβ fibrils, and attenuate oxidative stress through the combined treatment of chelating metals, photothermal therapy and scavenging ROS. In behavioral experiments, it also significantly improved the cognitive and learning deficits in late-stage APP/PS1 mice, thereby providing new ideas for the treatment of late-stage AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

This review explores the impact of chronic sleep deprivation and physical exercise on brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drawing insights from 40 selected studies, the review synthesizes evidence on these lifestyle factors' correlations with neurodegenerative changes. Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts circadian rhythms and neurochemical pathways, potentially accelerating brain atrophy, while physical exercise preserves brain structure by enhancing vascular health, reducing inflammation, and supporting synaptic plasticity, particularly in regions like the hippocampus. Results highlight distinct patterns of brain atrophy in AD and MCI, underscoring the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. Understanding the relationship between sleep disruption and brain health provides insights into strategies for possibly delaying neurodegenerative diseases like MCI, which represents a milder form of Alzheimer's, and AD. The findings underscore the potential utility of integrating sleep therapy and physical exercise interventions in clinical practice for early detection of mild cognitive impairment and potentially delaying disease progression.

    "ArticleTitle": "Familial Alzheimer's disease mutations in amyloid precursor protein impair calcineurin signaling to NMDA receptors.",
    "AbstractText": "Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is frequently associated with mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which are thought to lead to cognitive deficits by impairing NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity. Given the reliance of synaptic plasticity on NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ entry, shaping of NMDAR activity by APP and/or its disease-causing variants could provide a basis for understanding synaptic plasticity impairments associated with FAD. A region of APP (residues 639-644 within APP695) processed by the γ-secretase complex, which generates amyloid-β peptides, is a hotspot for FAD mutations. This region bears similarity to a binding motif for calcineurin (CaN), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. Interaction assays confirm that APP associates with CaN in native tissue as well as in a heterologous expression system. This capacity to bind CaN extends to APP family members amyloid precursor-like protein 1 and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP1 and APLP2, respectively). Electrophysiological analysis demonstrates that APP and its family members limit NMDAR activity, in a manner consistent with CaN-dependent regulation of NMDAR desensitization. FAD mutations, in this region of APP, impair this regulation and consequently enhance NMDAR activity. Thus, by altering the landscape for CaN regulation of NMDA receptors, FAD mutations in APP may contribute to faulty information processing by modifying the dynamic range and temporal window of a critical signal for synaptic plasticity.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Although there is increasing evidence that environmental exposures are associated with the risk of neurodegenerative conditions, there is still limited mechanistic evidence evaluating potential mediators in human populations. METHODS: UK Biobank is a large long-term study of 500,000 adults enrolled from 2006 to 2010 age 40-69 years. ICD-10 classified reports of dementia cases up to 2022 (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia in other classified diseases, and unspecified dementia) were identified from health record linkage. Estimates of residential air pollution, traffic noise, and greenspace exposure have been modelled. Structural brain MRI was conducted from 2014 to 2022, with brain volumes relevant to dementia identified a priori. Associations between environmental exposures, brain volumes, and dementia cases (diagnosed post-MRI) were tested using linear and logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, household income, ethnicity, education, smoking, and area-level deprivation. Mediation of exposure-outcome associations by plausible brain volumes (those associated with both environmental exposure and dementia outcomes) were modelled using the quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo method (N = 34,817-39,772). RESULTS: Small but significant mediating effects (2%-8% of relationships mediated) were observed between PM2.5abs exposure and dementia risk by reduced total brain volume, NOx and Alzheimer's disease risk by reduced peripheral cortical grey matter, PM2.5abs and vascular dementia risk by reduced peripheral cortical grey matter, PM2.5abs and other dementia risk by reduced total grey matter, and PM10 and other dementia risk by reduced total grey matter. Greenspace and noise were not associated with dementia outcomes in the subset of the cohort providing brain imaging data. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to existing evidence of associations between environmental exposures and dementia outcomes. Our findings provide novel evidence that differences in brain volume may mediate these relationships. Future research is required to prove this mechanism and establish the other mechanisms through which exposure to air pollution might increase dementia risk.",

Initial analyses encompassing sequence alignment, structural elucidation, and functional characterization reveal distinctive attributes of the Aβ peptide and the identified BS candidates. Quantum chemical calculations, using the ORCA Program (v4.0) employed Density Functional Theory (DFT), specifically the Becke 3-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) method, to investigate the electronic structure and energetics of novel isolates.

According to MRI morphometry, in the group of patients with AD compared with POAG, there was a decrease in the volumes of gray matter of the brain, hippocampus, right thalamus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, right cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, as well as thicknesses: entorhinal cortex, cingulate gyrus and fusiform gyrus (p<0.05). When comparing volumes according to MRI morphometry with healthy individuals, patients with AD revealed a statistically significant decrease in all studied neuroimaging indicators, and when comparing thicknesses: left entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus; while in POAG only a decrease in the volumes of gray matter of the brain, thalamus, and right medial orbitofrontal cortex was noted. CONCLUSION: POAG can be considered not only as an independent disease, but also as a predictor of the development of AD, therefore, the statistically significant differences we obtained between the AD group and POAG according to MRI morphometry may reflect the dynamics of the neurodegenerative process and depend on the severity of CI. In this connection, MRI morphometry can be considered not only as a method of early diagnosis, but also as an assessment of disease progression. In this case, it is important to determine not only the thicknesses, but also the volumes of brain structures according to MRI morphometry data.",

This review focuses on cellular models derived from the olfactory epithelium as a promising tool to study the molecular mechanisms of some neuropsychiatric diseases. The authors consider cell lines allowing the identification of potential biomarkers and pathogenetic mechanisms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. Advantages of these models include the preservation of epigenetic modifications, the possibility of studying intercellular interactions, and conducting personalized studies. Particular emphasis is placed on state-of-the-art analytical techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and DNA methylation analysis, as well as non-invasive methods of obtaining cellular material. The use of these models opens up new perspectives for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches and optimizing existing treatment regimens for psychiatric disorders.",

    "AbstractText": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-related small vessel disease pathologically characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide in cerebrovascular walls, affecting both cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. Amyloid deposition results in fragile vessels, which may lead to lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and cognitive impairment. To evaluate the probability and severity of CAA, the imaging markers depicted on CT and MRI techniques are crucial, as brain pathological examination is highly invasive. Although the Boston criteria have established diagnostic value and have been updated to version 2.0, due to an aging population, the patients with CAA should also be assessed for their risk of future ICH or cognitive impairment. Furthermore, an increased awareness of CAA is essential when introducing anticoagulants for infarct in elderly patients or anti-amyloid antibodies for Alzheimer's disease, as these may worsen CAA-related hemorrhagic lesions. However, the radiological literature on CAA has not been comprehensively updated. Here, we review the imaging markers of CAA and clinical significance. We also discuss the clinical and imaging characteristics of CAA-related inflammation, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, and iatrogenic-CAA.",

However, the biological embedding of structural inequality in aging and dementia, especially among underrepresented populations, is unclear. We examined the association between structural inequality (country-level and state-level Gini indices) and brain volume and connectivity in 2,135 healthy controls, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobe degeneration from Latin America and the United States. Greater structural inequality was linked to reduced brain volume and connectivity, with stronger effects in Latin America, especially in the temporo-cerebellar, fronto-thalamic and hippocampal regions. In the United States, milder effects were observed in the insular-cingular and temporal areas. Results were more pronounced in Alzheimer's disease and were independent of age, sex, education, cognition and other confounding factors. The findings highlight the critical role of structural inequality in aging and dementia, emphasizing the biological embedding of macrosocial factors and the need for targeted interventions in underserved populations.",

Despite numerous studies, specific age-related factors remain unidentified. This study employed a multi-omics approach to investigate the link between PD and aging. We integrated blood gene expression profiles, expression quantitative trait loci, genome-wide association studies, predictive models, and conducted clinical validation.By analyzing PD datasets, a total of 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 10 intersecting aging differentially expressed genes (ADEGs) were identified. Enrichment analysis revealed that the regulatory pathways of these ADEGs involve the classical Wnt signaling pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuronal apoptosis. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis showed that the MAP3K5 gene significantly reduces the risk of PD. Multivariate regression analysis identified MXD1, CREB1, and SIRT3 as key diagnostic genes and constructed a predictive model to aid clinical decision-making. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments validated the expression levels of these genes in the serum of PD patients.This study utilized a multi-omics approach to identify key ADEGs and their regulatory mechanisms in PD, leading to the establishment of a diagnostic model.

These new-born microglia are thought to be \"rejuvenated\" and have been shown to be beneficial in several disease contexts and in normal aging. Their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thus of great interest as they represent a potential disease-modifying therapy. Here, we explored the differential effects of microglial depletion and repopulation during amyloid pathology progression using 5xFAD mice. We utilized the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 to induce microglial self-renewal and tracked microglia-plaque dynamics with in vivo imaging. We observed transient improvement in plaque burden on different timescales depending on the animal's age. While the improvement in plaque burden did not persist in any age group, renewing microglia during mid- to late-pathology might still be beneficial as we observed a potential improvement in microglial sensitivity to noradrenergic signaling. Altogether, our findings provide further insights into the therapeutic potential of microglial renewal in AD.",

Timely intervention at an early stage of the disease may mitigate disease progression. Recent studies indicate that BDNF and MMP-9 play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, this study aims to ascertain whether there are differences in plasma BDNF and MMP-9 levels between individuals with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and those with normal cognition, and to analyze the factors influencing mild cognitive impairment.This case-control study included 102 individuals with mild cognitive impairment and 102 controls, matched by age and sex. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, neuropsychological assessments, and clinical examinations. Plasma concentrations of BDNF and MMP-9 of the participants were quantified using ELISA. Subsequently, the factors influencing MCI were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The differences in plasma BDNF levels, MOCA total scores, and scores in various cognitive domains (including visuospatial and executive abilities, abstract thinking, attention, language, naming, and delayed memory) between the MCI and the control groups showed statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Over the past two decades, neuroimaging data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans has been increasingly used in the study of brain pathology related to the birth and growth of AD. Recent studies have employed machine learning to detect and classify AD. Deep learning models have also been increasingly utilized with varying degrees of success. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for early detection and classification of AD using structural MRI (sMRI). The proposed model employs a unique combination of machine learning and deep learning approaches to optimize the precision and accuracy of the detection and classification of AD. The proposed approach surpassed multi-modal machine learning algorithms in accuracy, precision, and F-measure performance measures.

This study integrates various bioinformatics methodologies with interpretable machine learning to identify reliable biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and construction of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks, we meticulously analyzed the AD dataset from the GEO database to pinpoint Hub genes. Subsequently, various machine learning algorithms were employed to construct diagnostic models, which were then elucidated using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To visualize our findings, we generated an insightful bioinformatics map of 10 Hub genes. We then conducted experimental validation on less-studied Hub genes, revealing significant differential mRNA expression of MYH9 and RHOQ in an AD cell model. Finally, we explored the biological significance of these two genes at the single-cell transcriptome level. This study not only introduces interactive SHAP panels for precise decision-making in AD but also offers novel insights into the identification of AD biomarkers through interpretable machine learning diagnostic models. Particularly, MYH9 has emerged as a promising new potential biomarker, pointing the way towards enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized therapeutic strategies for AD.

    "AbstractText": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important driver of neurodegeneration and synaptic abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Aβ) in mitochondria leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in a vicious cycle of oxidative stress in coordination with a defective electron transport chain (ETC), decreasing ATP production. AD neurons exhibit impaired mitochondrial dynamics, evidenced by fusion and fission imbalances, increased fragmentation, and deficient mitochondrial biogenesis, contributing to fewer mitochondria in brains of AD patients. Nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1) is a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis through its activation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Our hypothesis posited that NRF1 induction in neuronal cells exposed to amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42) would increase de novo mitochondrial synthesis and improve mitochondrial function, restoring neuronal survival. Following NRF1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection of Aβ1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells, a marked increase in mitochondrial mass was observed. Metabolic programming toward enhanced oxidative phosphorylation resulted in increased ATP production. Oxidative stress in the form of mitochondrial ROS accumulation was reduced and mitochondrial membrane potential preserved. Mitochondrial homeostasis was maintained, evidenced by balanced fusion and fission processes. Ultimately, improvement of mitochondrial function was associated with significant decreases in Aβ1-42-induced neuronal death and neurite disruption. Our findings highlight the potential of NRF1 upregulation to counteract Aβ1-42-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative cell processes, opening avenues for innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at safeguarding mitochondrial health in AD neurons.",

However, little is known about the association between the frequency of salt added at the table and incident dementia. This study investigates the association of the frequency of salt added at the table with the risk of dementia and explores differences in the associations among people with apolipoprotein E ε4 genotypes. METHODS: Individuals indicated whether they added salt to their food at the table (salt used for cooking was not included) \"never/rarely\", \"sometimes\", \"usually\", or \"always\". Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals and evaluate the association between the frequency of salt added at the table and incident dementia. RESULTS: We observed a graded relation between the frequency of salt added at the table and spot urine sodium concentrations and estimated 24-h sodium excretion. Over a median follow-up of 13.7 years, there were 9373 cases of all-cause dementia, including 4119 of Alzheimer's disease and 2052 of vascular dementia. With a higher frequency of salt added at the table, the risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia increased in a monotonic manner after adjustment for potential confounding factors (all P-trend <0.001). These associations of the frequency of salt added at the table with the risks of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were greater in apolipoprotein E ε4 heterozygotes and homozygotes.

The study explored the interactions of σ1R with various agonists, antagonists across different species. Ligand and protein-protein (σ1R-BiP) docking approaches were used to understand the significance of σ1R in modulating neuroprotective mechanisms and its potential role in Alzheimer's. Ligand docking revealed that common σ1R antagonists generally exhibited stronger σ1R binding than commonly used agonists. Human σ1R showed high binding affinity for S1RA and NE100. Orthologs in yeast, slime mold, and C. elegans displayed varied binding affinities, indicating evolutionary adaptation in their binding pockets. We evaluated the relevance of σ1R-ligand interactions in C. elegans, measuring life-spans showing the impact of ligands on lifespan depends on genetic background and amyloid-beta pathology. Haloperidol (5-10 mM) extended wild-type worms' lifespan, but this effect was absent in the σ1R-KO, suggesting at least a partial role for the σ1R. Fluoxetine (5-10 mM) also promoted a small increase in longevity in wild-type worms but was not seen in the σ1R-KO strain. BD1047 (5 & 10 mM) reduced the lifespan of amyloid-beta-expressing transgenic worms, whereas dipentylamine (DPA) (5 mM) significantly increased the lifespan in a σ1R antagonist-sensitive manner. These findings highlight the importance of the σ1R in neurodegeneration and suggest that ligand interactions are modulated by BiP.

Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells (MCs), natural killer cells and neutrophils, bear pattern recognition receptors and are thus able to recognize common molecular patterns, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the later occurring in the context of neuroinflammation. An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise \"primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative\" disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention. Activated MCs are multifunctional effector cells generated from hematopoietic stem cells that, together with dendritic cells, represent first-line immune defense mechanisms against pathogens and/or tissue destruction. METHODS: This review aims to summarize evidence of MC implication in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: In view of recent evidence that the gut-brain axis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the characterization of the neuroinflammatory component in the pathology of these diseases, this review also focuses on MCs as potential mediators in the gut-brain axis bi-directional communication and the possible role of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen known to alter the gut-brain axis homeostasis towards local and systemic pro-inflammatory responses.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, a class of novel antidiabetic agents, have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects beyond glycemic control, with potential benefits extending to the cardiovascular and renal systems. Recently, research has increasingly focused on exploring the potential role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in preventing dementia. The aim of this review is to summarize the current research suggesting that SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, may have neuroprotective effects that reduce dementia risk and improve cognitive function in type 2 diabetes patients. These benefits are likely due to better glycemic control, reduced oxidative stress, and less advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation, all linked to neurodegeneration. Despite these promising findings, existing studies are limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up durations, which may not adequately capture long-term outcomes. To establish more robust evidence, larger-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving diverse populations are needed. These studies should involve diverse populations and focus on understanding the mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effects. Addressing these limitations will provide clearer guidelines for using SGLT-2 inhibitors in dementia prevention and management.

    "AbstractText": "Circadian rhythms are intrinsic, 24 h cycles that regulate key physiological, mental, and behavioral processes, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism. These rhythms are controlled by the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus, which synchronizes with environmental signals, such as light and temperature, and consequently maintains alignment with the day-night cycle. Molecular feedback loops, driven by core circadian \"clock genes\", such as Clock, Bmal1, Per, and Cry, are essential for rhythmic gene expression; disruptions in these feedback loops are associated with various health issues. Dysregulated lipid metabolism in the brain has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders by contributing to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction, as observed in conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Disruptions in circadian gene expression have been shown to perturb lipid regulatory mechanisms in the brain, thereby triggering neuroinflammatory responses and oxidative damage. This review synthesizes current insights into the interconnections between circadian rhythms and lipid metabolism, with a focus on their roles in neurological health and disease. It further examines how the desynchronization of circadian genes affects lipid metabolism and explores the potential mechanisms through which disrupted circadian signaling might contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Saliva, with its non-invasive and cost-effective nature, presents a promising alternative to cerebrospinal fluid and plasma for biomarker discovery. Methods: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of saliva samples (n = 20 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 20 Alzheimer's disease and age- and n = 40 gender-matched cognitively normal individuals), from the South Australian Neurodegenerative Disease (SAND) cohort, integrating proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome data with plasma measurements, including pTau181. Results: Among the most promising findings, the protein Stratifin emerged as a top candidate, showing a strong negative correlation with plasma pTau181 (r = -0.49, p < 0.001) and achieving an AUC of 0.95 in distinguishing AD and MCI combined from controls. In the metabolomics analysis, 3-chlorotyrosine and L-tyrosine exhibited high correlations with disease severity progression, with AUCs of 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in vitamin B12 metabolism, with Transcobalamin-1 levels decreasing in saliva as AD progressed despite an increase in serum vitamin B12 levels (p = 0.008). Microbiome analysis identified shifts in bacterial composition, with a microbiome cluster containing species such as Lautropia mirabilis showing a significant decrease in abundance in MCI and AD samples. The overall findings were reinforced by weighted correlation network analysis, which identified key hubs and enriched pathways associated with AD. Conclusions: Collectively, these data highlight the potential of saliva as a powerful medium for early AD diagnosis, offering a practical solution for large-scale screening and monitoring.",

In recent years, the integration of cutting-edge medical imaging technologies with forefront theories in artificial intelligence has dramatically enhanced the efficiency of identifying and diagnosing brain diseases such as AD. This paper presents an innovative two-stage automatic auxiliary diagnosis algorithm for AD, based on an improved 3D DenseNet segmentation model and an improved MobileNetV3 classification model applied to brain MR images. In the segmentation network, the backbone network was simplified, the activation function and loss function were replaced, and the 3D GAM attention mechanism was introduced. In the classification network, firstly, the CA attention mechanism was added to enhance the model's ability to capture positional information of disease features; secondly, dilated convolutions were introduced to extract richer features from the input feature maps; and finally, the fully connected layer of MobileNetV3 was modified and the idea of transfer learning was adopted to improve the model's feature extraction capability. The results of the study showed that the proposed approach achieved classification accuracies of 97.85% for AD/NC, 95.31% for MCI/NC, 93.96% for AD/MCI, and 92.63% for AD/MCI/NC, respectively, which were 3.1, 2.8, 2.6, and 2.8 percentage points higher than before the improvement.

HCNNs matched CNNs' performance in less complex settings and demonstrated superior semantic organization and robustness to adversarial attacks. While HCNNs equaled CNNs in out-of-sample datasets identifying Alzheimer's disease, in zero-shot evaluations, HCNNs outperformed CNNs and radiologists. HCNNs deliver enhanced robustness and organization in neuroimaging data. This likely underlies why, while HCNNs perform similarly to CNNs with respect to in-sample tasks, they confer improved generalizability. Nevertheless, HCNNs encounter efficiency and performance challenges with larger, complex datasets. These limitations underline the need for further optimization of HCNN architectures. HCNNs present promising improvements in generalizability and resilience for medical imaging applications, particularly in neuroimaging. Despite facing challenges with larger datasets, HCNNs enhance performance under adversarial conditions and offer better semantic organization, suggesting valuable potential in generalizable deep learning models in medical imaging and neuroimaging diagnostics.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Assessment of Modified Citrus Pectin's Effects on Dementia in the Scopolamine-Induced Alzheimer's Model in Adult Male Wistar Rats.",
    "AbstractText": "Modified citrus pectin (MCP) modulates galectin-3, a key player in neuroinflammation linked to Alzheimer's disease. By inhibiting galectin-3, MCP reduces the brain's inflammatory response and may alleviate cognitive decline. This study examines MCP's impact on neuroinflammation, cognitive function, and its role in galectin-3 inhibition in a dementia model. Male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups: control (n = 6), scopolamine (SCP) (n = 7), SCP + MCP (n = 7), and MCP only (n = 7). MCP was administered orally at 100 mg/kg/day via drinking water for six weeks. SCP was injected intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg for seven days to induce an Alzheimer's-type dementia model. The researchers assessed cognitive performance through the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. After behavioral tests, blood and brain tissues, including the hippocampus, were collected and stored at -80 °C for analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and galectin-3). The data were analyzed with SPSS 22. SCP treatment increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and elevated inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, and galectin-3), while reducing BDNF and impairing spatial memory. Co-administering MCP with SCP significantly reduced TNF-α, IL-6, and galectin-3 levels; increased BDNF; and improved memory performance. Although MCP did not lower MDA levels, it boosted SOD activity, suggesting antioxidant effects. Modified citrus pectin (MCP) alleviated cognitive impairments and reduced neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's-type dementia by inhibiting galectin-3. MCP also exhibited antioxidant potential, underscoring its therapeutic promise for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "AbstractText": "Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) 1 belongs to the mammalian germinal center kinase (GCK) family. It contains the N-terminal, conserved kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, a proline-rich region, and a GCK, C-terminal domain with the Citron-NIK-Homology (CNH) domain. The kinase is an essential component of cellular signaling pathways, which include Wnt signaling, JNK signaling, pathways engaging Ras proteins, the Hippo pathway, and STRIPAK complexes. It thus contributes to regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, embryogenesis, or tissue homeostasis. MINK1 plays an important role in immunological responses, inhibiting Th17 and Th1 cell differentiation and regulating NLRP3 inflammasome function. It may be considered a link between ROS and the immunological system, and a potential antiviral target for human enteroviruses. The kinase has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, SLE, and more. It is also involved in tumorigenesis and drug resistance in cancer. Silencing MINK1 reduces cancer cell migration, suggesting potential for new therapeutic approaches. Targeting MINK1 could be a promising treatment strategy for patients insensitive to current chemotherapies, and could improve their prognosis. Moreover, MINK1 plays an important role in the nervous system and the cardiovascular system development and function. The modulation of MINK1 activity could influence the course of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Further exploration of the activity of the kinase could also help in gaining more insight into factors involved in thrombosis or congenital heart disease. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on MINK1, highlight its therapeutic and prognostic potential, and encourage more studies in this area.",

    "AbstractText": "Detecting and tracking the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now of particular interest due to the aging of the world's population. AD is the most common cause of dementia, affecting the daily lives of those afflicted. Approaches in development can accelerate the evaluation of the preclinical stages of AD and facilitate early treatment and the prevention of symptom progression. Shifts in P300 amplitude and latency, together with neuropsychological assessments, could serve as biomarkers in the early screening of declines in cognitive abilities. In this study, we investigated the ability of the P300 indices evoked during a visual oddball task to differentiate pre-clinically diagnosed participants from normal healthy adults (HCs). Two preclinical stages, named asymptomatic AD (AAD) and prodromal AD (PAD), were included in this study, and a total of 79 subjects participated, including 35 HCs, 22 AAD patients, and 22 PAD patients. A mixed-design ANOVA test was performed to compare the P300 indices among groups during the processing of the target and non-target stimuli. Additionally, the correlation between these neurophysiological variables and the neuropsychological tests was evaluated. Our results revealed that neither the peak amplitude nor latency of P300 can distinguish AAD from HCs. Conversely, the peak latency of P300 can be used as a biomarker to differentiate PAD from AAD and HCs. The correlation results revealed a significant relationship between the peak latency of P300 and memory domain tasks, showing that less time-demanding neuropsychological assessments can be used. In summary, our findings showed that a combination of P300 latency and memory-requiring tasks can be used as an efficient biomarker to differentiate individuals with AAD from HCs.",

In this registry-based study, fall incidence and characteristics of the fallers were explored in a large population with cognitive impairment. Methods: NorCog, \"The Norwegian Registry of Persons Assessed for Cognitive Symptoms\", is a national research and quality registry with a biomaterial collection. This study included 9525 persons from the registry who had answered the question about falls. Fall incidence was studied, and the characteristics of fallers and non-fallers were compared. Results: The annual fall incidence was 3774/9525 (39.6%). The incidence varied between types of dementia, from 22.4% in persons with the debut of Alzheimer's disease before 65 years of age to 55.3% in persons with vascular dementia and with increasing degrees of cognitive impairment. A wide range of personal characteristics, symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, and physical, psychological, and cognitive tests differed between fallers and non-fallers, most in disfavour of the fallers. Age, reduced Personal Activities of Daily Living, reduced gait speed, delayed recall, use of a walking aid, and depression were independent predictors of falls. Conclusions: Among cognitively impaired persons with a history of falls, frailty was an independent predictor of falls. Neither the type of dementia nor the degree of cognitive impairment were independent predictors of falls. Prevention of frailty by physical training and social activity may be important in mitigating fall risk among older adults with impaired cognition.",

    "AbstractText": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterized by insulin resistance, is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrovascular dysfunction is manifested in both T2DM and AD, and is often considered as a pathological link between the two diseases. Insulin signaling regulates critical functions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and endothelial insulin resistance could lead to BBB dysfunction, aggravating AD pathology. However, insulin signaling is intrinsically dynamic and involves interactions among numerous molecular mediators. Hence, a mechanistic systems biology model is needed to understand how insulin regulates BBB physiology and the consequences of its impairment in T2DM and AD. In this study, we investigated the pharmacodynamic effect of insulin on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), a marker of cerebrovascular inflammation. Intriguingly, normal insulin concentrations selectively activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, leading to decreased VCAM1 expression. However, exposure to supraphysiological insulin levels, which is present in insulin resistance, activated both PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways, and increased VCAM1 expression. We developed a mathematical model that adequately described the dynamics of various insulin signaling nodes and VCAM1 expression. Further, the model was integrated with in vitro proteomics and transcriptomics data from AD patients to simulate VCAM1 expression under pathological conditions. This approach allowed us to establish a quantitative systems pharmacology framework to investigate BBB dysfunction in AD and metabolic syndrome, thereby offering opportunities to identify specific disruptions in molecular networks that will enable us to identify novel therapeutic targets.",

    "ArticleTitle": "An Evidence-Based IT Program With Chatbot to Support Caregiving and Clinical Care for People With Dementia: The CareHeroes Development and Usability Pilot.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: There are numerous communication barriers between family caregivers and providers of people living with dementia, which can pose challenges to caregiving and clinical decision-making. To address these barriers, a new web and mobile-enabled app, called CareHeroes, was developed, which promotes the collection and secured sharing of clinical information between caregivers and providers. It also provides caregiver support and education. OBJECTIVE: The primary study objective was to examine whether dementia caregivers would use CareHeroes as an adjunct to care and gather psychosocial data from those who used the app. METHODS: This paper presents the implementation process used to integrate CareHeroes into clinical care at 2 memory clinics and preliminary outcome evaluation. Family caregivers receiving services at clinics were asked to use the app for a 12-month period to collect, track, and share clinical information with the care recipient's provider. They also used it to assess their own mental health symptoms. Psychosocial outcomes were assessed through telephone interviews and user data were collected by the app. RESULTS: A total of 21 caregivers enrolled in the pilot study across the 2 memory clinics. Usage data indicated that caregivers used many of the features in the CareHeroes app, though the chatbot was the most frequently used feature. Outcome data indicated that caregivers' depression was lower at 3-month follow-up (t11=2.03, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention of the pilot study were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, and therefore more testing is needed with a larger sample to determine the potential impact of CareHeroes on caregivers' mental health. Despite this limitation, the pilot study demonstrated that integrating a new supportive app for caregivers as an adjunct to clinical dementia care is feasible. Implications for future technology intervention development, implementation planning, and testing for caregivers of people living with dementia are discussed.",

    "AbstractText": "Recombinant antibodies are a promising class of therapeutics to treat protein misfolding associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and several antibodies that inhibit aggregation are approved or in clinical trials to treat Alzheimer's disease. Here, we developed antibodies targeting the aggregation-prone β-propeller olfactomedin (OLF) domain of myocilin, variants of which comprise the strongest genetic link to glaucoma and cause early onset vision loss for several million individuals worldwide. Mutant myocilin aggregates intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequent ER stress causes cytotoxicity that hastens dysregulation of intraocular pressure, the primary risk factor for most forms of glaucoma. Our antibody discovery campaign yielded two recombinant antibodies: anti-OLF1 recognizes a linear epitope, while anti-OLF2 is selective for natively folded OLF and inhibits aggregation in vitro. By binding OLF, these antibodies engage autophagy/lysosomal degradation to promote degradation of two pathogenic mutant myocilins. This work demonstrates the potential for therapeutic antibodies to disrupt ER-localized protein aggregates by altering the fate of folding intermediates. This approach could be translated as a precision medicine to treat myocilin-associated glaucoma with in situ antibody expression. More generally, the study supports the approach of enhancing lysosomal degradation to treat proteostasis decline in glaucoma and other diseases.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Modifiable risk factors play an important role in preventing dementia and reducing its progression. Regular physical activity already in midlife, which relies on intact multisensory balance control, can help to decrease the risk of dementia. However, our understanding of the relationship between postural balance and cognitive functions remains limited. The objective of our study was to investigate the association of postural balance during different sensory conditions with specific cognitive domains in older adults. METHODS: Participants were from the population-based prospective \"Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases\" (LIFE-Adult) cohort in Leipzig, Germany. Executive, memory and processing speed functions were tested by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) plus battery. Assessment of visuospatial abilities was based on the short form of the Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLO). Postural sway was recorded on a force plate with eyes open and closed. Romberg's ratios were calculated for sway path and sway area as a proxy for balance without visual control and tested in generalized linear regression models with the summary scores of executive function, memory, processing speed and visuospatial function as dependent variables. All models were adjusted for sex, age, ApoE status, socioeconomic status, anamnestic stroke, and diabetes. RESULTS: In total, we analyzed 460 participants with a mean age of 68.6 years, range 60 to 80, 47.6% female. A higher Romberg's ratio for sway area was a significant indicator for impaired visuospatial abilities as measured by the dichotomized JLO (Odds Ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.88). Romberg's ratios were not significantly associated with executive functions, procedural speed or memory functions. DISCUSSION: It may be worthwhile to examine in the future whether inclusion of balance testing enhances the value of screening programs for cognitive impairment. Inversely, it may be appropriate to apply routine cognitive tests when balance problems are detected in older patients.",

METHODS: Two hundred twenty Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants with unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia completed the T-Cog during their annual UDS evaluation. We assessed administration feasibility and diagnostic group differences cross-sectionally across telephone versus videoconference modalities, and compared T-Cog to prior in-person UDS scores longitudinally. RESULTS: Administration time averaged 54 min and 79% of participants who initiated a T-Cog completed all 12 subtests; completion time and rates differed by diagnostic group but not by modality. Performance varied expectedly across groups with moderate to strong associations between most T-Cog measures and in-person correlates, although select subtests demonstrated lower comparability. DISCUSSION: The T-Cog is feasibly administered and shows preliminary validity in a cognitively heterogeneous cohort. Normative data from this cohort should be expanded to more diverse populations to enhance utility and generalizability. HIGHLIGHTS: This study examined the feasibility and validity of the remote Uniform Data Set (also known as the T-Cog) and contributes key normative data for widespread use.A remote neuropsychological battery was feasibly administered with high overall engagement and completion rates, adequate reliability compared to in-person testing, and evidence of validity across diagnostic groups.Typical barriers to administration included hearing impairment, technology issues, and distractions; hearing difficulties were particularly common among cognitively impaired groups.Certain tests were less closely related to their in-person correlates and should be used with caution.",

Integrate VGG-16 with Random Forest (VGG-16-RF) and VGG-16 with Support Vector Machine (VGG-16-SVM) to enhance the binary classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease, comparing their performance against traditional classifiers. METHOD: OpenNeuro and Harvard's Data verse provides Alzheimer's coronal functional MRI data. Ventricles and hippocampus are segmented using a Deep-Residual-UNet and Deep labV3+ system. The functional features were extracted from each segmented component and classified using SVM, Adaboost, Logistic regression, and VGG 16, DenseNet-169, VGG-16-RF, and VGG-16-SVM classifier. RESULTS: This research proposes a precise and efficient deep-learning architecture like DeepLab V3+ and Deep Residual U-NET for hippocampus and ventricle segmentation in detection of AD. DeepLab V3+ has produced a good segmentation accuracy of 94.62% with Jaccard co-efficient of 85.5% and dice co-efficient of 84.75%.

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Abnormal intracellular accumulation of Tau aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other Tauopathies, such as Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau deposits primarily affect neurons, but evidence indicates that glial cells may also be affected and contribute distinctively to disease progression. Cells can respond to toxic insults by orchestrating global changes in posttranslational modifications of their proteome. Previous studies suggest that SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification consisting of conjugation of SUMO (Small ubiquitin-like modifier) to target proteins, was decreased in the hippocampus of AD patients and in animal model of AD compared with controls. This decrease in SUMOylation was correlated with increased Tau pathology and cognitive decline. Other studies have reported increased levels of SUMO in AD brains. The goal of our study was to evaluate whether SUMO conjugation modifies the neurodegenerative disease pathology associated with the aggregation-prone mutant TauP301L, in neurons and in glial cells. METHODS: We used viral approaches to express mutant TauP301L and SUMO2 in the hippocampus of wild-type mice. We assessed Tau distribution by immunostaining and Tau aggregation by insolubility assays followed by western blotting. We assessed neuronal toxicity and performed cell count and shape descriptor analyses on astrocytes and microglial cells. RESULTS: We found that mutant TauP301L, when expressed exclusively in neurons, is toxic not only to neurons but also to glial cells, and that SUMO2 counteracts TauP301L toxicity in neurons as well as in glia. DISCUSSION: Our results uncover an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism, whereby SUMO2 conjugation reduces Tau neuropathology and protects against toxic effects of Tau in glial cells.",

How the latent processes of selective attention (i.e., from perception to motor response) contribute to these inhibition deficits remains unclear. Therefore, the present study examined contributions of selective attention to aMCI-related inhibition deficits using computational modeling of attentional dynamics. Two models of selective attention - the dual-stage two-phase model and the shrinking spotlight model - were fitted to individual participant data from a flanker task completed by 34 individuals with single-domain aMCI (sdaMCI, 66-86 years), 20 individuals with multiple-domain aMCI (mdaMCI, 68-88 years), and 52 healthy controls (64-88 years). Findings showed greater commission errors in the mdaMCI group compared to controls. Final-fitting model parameters indicated inhibitory and early perceptual deficits in mdaMCI , and impaired spatial allocation of attention in both MCI groups. Model parameters differentiated mdaMCI from sdaMCI and controls with moderate-to-high sensitivity and specificity. Impairments in perception and selective attention may contribute to inhibition deficits in both aMCI subtypes.",

This study aimed to clarify the regulatory mechanism underlying the PgOMV-induced AD-like phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We intraperitoneally injected PgOMVs into the periphery of wild-type and CatB knockout mice for 4 or 8 weeks to assess the effect of CatB on PgOMV-induced AD pathology. Mice were evaluated for cognitive change, tau phosphorylation, microglial activation, neuroinflammation and synapse loss. Microglial and primary neuron culture were prepared to verify the in vivo results. RESULTS: CatB deficiency significantly alleviated PgOMV-induced cognitive dysfunction, microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation and synapse loss. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting suggested that CatB modulates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation through stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK)/Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) signals after administration of PgOMVs, which in turn regulates neuronal tau phosphorylation and synapse loss in a SAPK/JNK-dependent manner.

We previously identified that patient iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Mg) harboring the Alzheimer's disease (AD) TREM2R47H hypomorph display several functional deficits linked to metabolism. To investigate whether these deficits are associated with disruptions in metabolite signaling, we generated common variant, TREM2R47H and TREM2-/- variant human iPS-Mg. We assessed the ability of supplementation with citrate or succinate, key metabolites and cell cycle breaking points upon microglia activation, to overcome these functional deficits with potential impact on neurons. Succinate supplementation was more effective than citrate at overcoming mitochondrial deficits in OXPHOS and did not promote a glycolytic switch. Citrate enhanced the lipid content of TREM2R47H iPS-Mg and was more effective at overcoming Αβ phagocytic deficits, whereas succinate increased lipid content and phagocytic capacity in TREM2-/- iPS-Mg. Microglia cytokine secretion upon pro-inflammatory activation was moderately affected by citrate or succinate showing a condition-dependent increasing trend. Neither metabolite altered basal levels of soluble TREM2 shedding. In addition, neither citrate nor succinate enhanced glycolysis; instead, drove their effects through oxidative phosphorylation. IPS-neurons exposed to conditioned medium from TREM2 variant iPS-Mg showed changes in oxidative phosphorylation, which could be ameliorated when iPS-Mg were first treated with citrate or succinate. Our data point to discrete pathway linkage between microglial metabolism and functional outcomes with implications for AD pathogenesis and treatments.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Neurological complications are a significant concern of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the pathogenic mechanism of neurological symptoms associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is poorly understood. METHODS: We used Drosophila as a model to systematically analyze SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding structural and accessory proteins and identified the membrane protein (M) that disrupted mitochondrial functions in vivo. The M protein was stereotaxically injected to further assess its effects in the brains of wild-type (WT) and 5 × FAD mice. Omics technologies, including RNA sequencing and interactome analysis, were performed to explore the mechanisms of the effects of M protein both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural and accessory proteins in Drosophila identified that the M protein induces mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction, leading to reduced ATP production, ROS overproduction, and eventually cell death in the indirect flight muscles. In WT mice, M caused hippocampal atrophy, neural apoptosis, glial activation, and mitochondrial damage. These changes were further aggravated in 5 × FAD mice. M was localized to the Golgi apparatus and genetically interacted with four wheel drive (FWD, a Drosophila homolog of mammalian PI4KIIIβ) to regulate Golgi functions in flies. Fwd RNAi, but not PI4KIIIα RNAi, reversed the M-induced Golgi abnormality, mitochondrial fragmentation, and ATP reduction. Inhibition of PI4KIIIβ activity suppressed the M-induced neuronal cell death. Therefore, M induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis likely through disruption of Golgi-derived PI(4)P-containing vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: M disturbs the distribution and function of Golgi, leading to mitochondrial abnormality and eventually neurodegeneration via a PI4KIIIβ-mediated mechanism. This study reveals a potential mechanism for COVID-19 neurological symptoms and opens a new avenue for development of therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 M or mitochondria.",

However, the mechanisms linking HL to AD are not fully understood. This study explored the effects of drug-induced hearing loss (DIHL) on the expression of proteins associated with AD progression in mouse models. METHODS: DIHL was induced in 5xFAD and Tg2576 mice aged 3 to 3.5 weeks using kanamycin (700 mg/kg, subcutaneous) and furosemide (600 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The accumulation and expression of beta-amyloid (Aβ), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured through immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Additionally, the expression of proteins involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, including downstream effectors p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and S6, as well as proinflammatory cytokines, was analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to control conditions, HL led to a significant increase in the accumulation of Aβ in the hippocampus and cortex. Elevated levels of neuroinflammatory markers, including Iba1 and GFAP, as well as proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were observed. Moreover, DIHL enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and S6, indicating activation of the mTOR pathway. CONCLUSIONS: HL significantly increases Aβ accumulation in the brain. Furthermore, HL activates astrocytes and microglia, leading to increased neuroinflammation and thereby accelerating AD progression. These findings strongly suggest that HL contributes autonomously to neuroinflammation, highlighting the potential for early intervention in HL to reduce AD risk.",

The high cost and limited accessibility of eye-movement recordings have hindered their use in clinics. AIMS: We aim to develop an AI-driven eye-tracking tool for assessing AD using mobile devices with embedded cameras. METHODS: 166 AD patients and 107 normal controls (NC) were enrolled. The subjects completed eye-movement tasks on a pad. We compared the demographics and clinical features of two groups. The eye-movement features were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Logistic regression (LR) model was trained to classify AD and NC, and its performance was evaluated. A nomogram was established to predict AD. RESULTS: In training set, the model showed a good area under curve (AUC) of 0.85 for identifying AD from NC, with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 84%, positive predictive value of 0.87, and negative predictive value of 0.65. The validation of the model also yielded a favorable discriminatory ability with the AUC of 0.91, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 82%, 91%, 0.93, and 0.77 to identify AD patients from NC.

    "AbstractText": "Spatial impairment characterizes Alzheimer's disease (AD) from its earliest stages. We present the design and preliminary evaluation of \"Barn Ruins,\" a serious virtual reality (VR) wayfinding game for early-stage AD. Barn Ruins is tailored to the cognitive abilities of this population, featuring simple controls and error-based scoring system. Ten younger adults, ten cognitively healthy older adults, and ten age-matched individuals with AD participated in this study. They underwent cognitive assessments using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before gameplay. The game involves navigating a virtual environment to find a target room, with increasing levels of difficulty. This study aimed to confirm the cognitive sensitivity of the Barn Ruins' spatial learning score by studying its relationship with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. MoCA scores and spatial learning scores had a correlation coefficient of 0.755 (p < 0.001). Logistic regression further revealed that higher spatial learning scores significantly predicted lower odds of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.495, 95% CI [0.274, 0.746], p < 0.005). The initial results suggest that the game is effective in differentiating performance among participant groups. This research demonstrates the potential of the Barn Ruins game as an innovative tool for assessing spatial navigation in AD, highlighting areas for future validation and investigation as a training tool.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting memory, language, and thinking with no curative treatment. Symptoms appear gradually, and pathological brain changes may occur twenty years before the physical and psychological signs, pointing to the urgent development of preventive interventions. Physical activity has been investigated as a preventive tool to defeat the main biological features of AD: pathological amyloid protein plaques, tau tangles, myelin degeneration, and iron deposits in the brain. This work quantifies tau tangles, amyloid, iron, and ferroptosis in oligodendrocytes in the aged rat hippocampal formation and statistically correlates neuron-neuron, neuron-glia, and glia-glia crosstalk and the effect of physical exercise on it. Our results indicate that iron overload in the oligodendrocytes is an inducer of ferroptosis; physical exercise reduces inflammaging, and improves axon-myelin volume relations; tau, amyloid, iron, and hippocampal formation cells present statistical correlations. Our data suggest the beneficial effects of physical exercise in AD and a mathematical relationship between the hippocampal formation cells in sedentary and active individuals, which should be considered in human and animal studies as a guide to a better understanding of crosstalk physiology.",

    "AbstractText": "Understanding the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for advancing precision medicine specifically tailored to this disorder. Recent research has deepened our understanding of AD heterogeneity; however, translating these insights from bench to bedside via neuroimaging heterogeneity frameworks presents significant challenges. In this review, we systematically revisit prior studies and summarize the existing methodology of data-driven neuroimaging studies for AD heterogeneity. We organized the current methodology into 1) a subtyping clustering strategy for patients with AD, and we also subdivided it into subtyping analysis based on cross-sectional multimodal neuroimaging profiles and the identification of long-term disease progression from short-term datasets; 2) a stratified strategy that integrates neuroimaging measures with biomarkers; and 3) individual-specific abnormal patterns based on the normative model. Then, we evaluated the characteristics of these studies along 2 dimensions: 1) the understanding of pathology and 2) clinical application. We systematically address the limitations, challenges, and future directions of research into AD heterogeneity. Our goal is to enhance the neuroimaging heterogeneity framework for AD, thereby facilitating its transition from bench to bedside.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Efficient Seeding of Cerebral Vascular Aβ-Amyloidosis by Recombinant AβM1-42 Amyloid Fibrils.",
    "AbstractText": "Aβ-amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the brain are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. The spreading of Aβ amyloidosis in the brain appears to be mediated by a seeding mechanism, where preformed fibrils (called seeds) accelerate Aβ fibril formation by bypassing the rate-determining nucleation step. Several studies have demonstrated that Aβ amyloidosis can be induced in transgenic mice, producing human Aβ, by injecting Aβ-rich brain extracts (seeds) derived from transgenic mice and human AD brains. However, studies on recombinant seeds are limited. Therefore, we investigated the seeding activity of pure recombinant human Aβ fibrils of different compositions. Seeds were inoculated into APP23 mice at the age of 3 months and were analyzed after 6 months of incubation. Recombinant fibril seeds made from Aβ-peptides with an N-terminal methionine (i.e. (preformed fibrils from AβM1-42, AβM1-40, and AβM1-40 + AβM1-42) accelerated Aβ-amyloid plaque formation in vivo compared to non-inoculated transgenic control mice of the same age. In addition, all seeds induced CAA pathology. Interestingly, AβM1-42 containing seeds produced significantly more CAA and amyloid plaques than seeds containing pure AβM1-40, which was surprising given that APP23 mice produce approximately four-fold more Aβ1-40 substrate than Aβ1-42. This study showed that AβM1-42 fibrils are highly potent in seeding CAA and implies that conformational templating occurs in amyloid plaque as deduced by comparative amyloid ligand staining. Our results verify that recombinant Aβ fibrils are transmissible amyloids, and that in vivo seeding can accelerate, and redirect Aβ amyloidosis patterns compared to spontaneous age dependent amyloidosis.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The vicious circle between amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) overgeneration and microglial dysfunction is an important pathological event that promotes AD progression. However, therapeutic strategies toward only Aβ or microglial modulation still have many problems. Herein, inspired by the Aβ transportation, an Aβ-derived peptide (CKLVFFAED) engineered biomimetic nanodelivery system (MK@PC-R NPs) is reported for realizing BBB penetration and reprogram neuron and microglia in AD lesion sites. This hollow mesoporous Prussian blue-based MK@PC-R NPs carrying curcumin and miRNA-124 can down-regulate β secretase expression, thereby inhibiting Aβ production and reducing Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Meanwhile, MK@PC-R NPs with excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties could normalize the microglial phenotype and promote Aβ degradation, providing neuroprotection. As expected, after treatment with MK@PC-R NPs, the Aβ burdens, neuron damages, neuroinflammation, and memory deficits of transgenic AD mice (APP/PS1 mice) are significantly attenuated. Overall, this biomimetic nanodelivery system with anti-Aβ and anti-inflammatory properties provides a promising strategy for the multi-target therapy of early AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Cholesterol dysregulation, disorder of neuronal membrane lipid packing, and lipid rafts lead to the synthesis and accumulation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ), contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study shows that near-infrared (NIR) transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (tPBMT) can reduce Aβ load and restore the properties of neuronal plasma membrane, including Aβ production, bilayer order, rafts, lipid content, and Ca2+ channels during AD. Mice in the experiments were exposed to 808-nm LED for 1 h daily over 3 months. In the APOE transgenic model with cholesterol dysregulation, the cholesterol levels increased by 22 times, causing healthy neurons to produce toxic Aβ three times faster, increasing its load by five times. Consequently, Aβ disrupts the membrane bilayer and prompts the formation of lipid rafts and pores. NIR-tPBMT can nearly half attenuate Aβ load, restore membrane lipid order and rigidity, reduce the number of lipid rafts, modulate cholesterol synthesis, normalize Ca2+ influx by activated endocytosis, and reduce neuronal death. The Ca2+ influx induced by light does not cause excitotoxicity but modulates Ca2+/calmodulin signaling involved in AD mechanisms and cell viability. The transcriptome analysis of the brain cortex and hippocampus shows that light can downregulate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent AD-risk genes BACE, PSEN, and APP, and normalize cholesterol homeostasis via the HMGCR, DHCR7, and INSIG1 genes. Additionally, light enhances neuron resistance to the endoplasmic reticulum stress via activating transcription factors of the unfolded protein response. Thus, red/NIR light could be promising in combating AD, restoring synaptic plasticity in degenerating neurons and reducing Aβ load.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder world-wide, presents sex-specific differences in its manifestation and progression, necessitating personalized diagnostic approaches. Current procedures are often costly and invasive, lacking consideration of sex-based differences. This study introduces an explainable machine learning (ML) system to predict and differentiate the progression of AD based on sex, using non-invasive, easily collectible predictors such as neuropsychological test scores and sociodemographic data, enabling its application in every day clinical settings. The ML model uses SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to provide clear insights into its decision-making, making complex outcomes easier to interpret. The system includes a user-friendly graphical interface designed in collaboration with clinicians, supporting its integration into medical practice. The study extends the cohort to include healthy and Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects, aiming to support early diagnosis in AD pre-clinical stages. The ML system was trained on a large dataset of 2407 subjects from the ADNI open dataset, enhancing its robustness and applicability. By focusing on sex-specific features and utilizing longitudinal data, the system aims to improve prediction accuracy and early detection of AD, ultimately advancing personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Key findings highlight the significance of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory - Delayed Recall, and educational attainment in AD diagnosis and progression, with sex-based disparities.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Blood-based biomarkers of amyloid and tau have been shown to predict Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. Much less is known about their ability to predict risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an earlier disease stage. This study examined whether levels of blood biomarkers of amyloid (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), tau (p-tau181), neurodegeneration (NfL), and glial activation and neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], YKL40, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 [sTREM2]) collected when participants were cognitively normal are associated with the time to onset of MCI. METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants from the longitudinal observational BIOCARD study provided blood plasma at their baseline evaluation (\"baseline 1\"). A second \"baseline\" specimen (collected using slightly different procedures) was evaluated for participants who were still cognitively normal approximately 7 years later. The plasma assays were based on the NeuroToolKit (cobas Elecsys assays, Roche Diagnostics). Cox regression models tested the association of biomarker levels with time to MCI symptom onset, separately for both baselines. RESULTS: Participants included 271 individuals at \"baseline 1\" (mean age = 57.5 years, 60.5% female, including 82 who progressed to MCI/dementia) and 202 individuals at \"baseline 2\" (mean age = 64.5 years, 62.4% female, including 31 progressors). The mean clinical follow-up was 15.5 years for \"baseline 1\" and 9.9 years for \"baseline 2.\" For both baselines, lower plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (both hazard ratios, HRs ≤ 0.69, 95% CIs ≤ 0.55-0.87, p ≤ 0.034), higher GFAP (HRs ≥ 1.83, CIs ≥ 1.28-2.60, p < 0.002), and a higher ratio of p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40) (HRs ≥ 1.64, CIs ≥ 1.25-2.13, p ≤ 0.001) were each associated with an earlier time to MCI symptom onset. For baseline 2, higher p-tau181 (HR = 2.07, CI = 1.12-3.83, p = 0.021) and higher NfL (HR = 1.75, CI = 0.99-3.10, p = 0.05) were also associated with earlier MCI symptom onset for progression within 7 years. When combining biomarkers, neither GFAP nor NFL was associated with MCI symptom onset after accounting for AD biomarker levels (e.g., p-tau181/(Aβ42/Aβ40)), which remained significant. YKL40 and sTREM2 were not associated with MCI onset. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that during preclinical AD, more abnormal blood biomarker levels of amyloid (Aβ42/Aβ40), p-tau181, neurodegeneration (NfL), and neuroinflammation (GFAP) individually are associated with progression from normal cognition to MCI, but the AD-nonspecific neurodegeneration and inflammation markers were not associated with symptom onset after accounting for amyloid and p-tau levels.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the key molecular pathological mechanisms that occur in early AD progression as well as MCI. Expression profiling data from brain homogenates of 8 normal volunteers, and 6 patients with prodromal AD who had developed MCI were analyzed, and the data were obtained from GSE12685. Further, overexpression of GABBR2 was achieved in human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-M17 using expression plasmid transfection. GABBR2 was significantly overexpressed in brain tissues of patients with prodromal AD who had developed MCI, as compared to normal brains. Moreover, GABBR2 overexpressing cells showed a significant increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a large amount of reactive oxygen species production, a large opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and a significant increase in apoptosis compared with control cells. GABBR2 overexpression was significantly involved in early AD progression and MCI by causing cellular events such as intracellular Ca2+ imbalance, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "AbstractText": "pH and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) are two critical biomarkers to unveil the corresponding status of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Simultaneously monitoring pH and ONOO- fluctuations in the ER and mitochondria during AD progression is pivotal for clarifying the interplay between the disorders of the two organelles and revealing AD pathogenesis. Herein, we designed and synthesized a dual-channel fluorescent probe (DCFP) to visualize pH and ONOO- in the ER and mitochondria. DCFP possessed excellent sensitivity and selectivity to pH and ONOO- without spectral crosstalk and was utilized in monitoring the two analytes within AD model cells and larval zebrafish. Importantly, DCFP could preferentially target mitochondria in normal cells and be enriched in the ER after mitochondrial depolarization. With the aid of DCFP, the slower acidification rate of the ER than that of mitochondria induced by Aβ oligomers (AβOs) was first identified, which could be ascribed to the relief of the AβOs-triggered ER stress through the Ca2+ migration from the ER to mitochondria. Moreover, continuous exposure to AβOs led to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, accelerating the acidification and ONOO- overproduction within mitochondria. As a result, intracellular oxidative stress levels were elevated, further exacerbating ER stress and aggravating ER acidification in turn. The advanced understanding of the potential interplay between the ER and mitochondria in this work may offer new insights and methodologies for studying AD pathogenesis. The DCFP developed in this work could also be employed to study other diseases related to ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "ArticleTitle": "A Copper-Binding Peptide with Therapeutic Potential against Alzheimer's Disease: From the Blood-Brain Barrier to Metal Competition.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. AD brains are characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) that bind Cu2+ and have been associated with several neurotoxic mechanisms. Although the use of copper chelators to prevent the formation of Cu2+-Aβ complexes has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, recent studies show that copper is an important neuromodulator that is essential for a neuroprotective mechanism mediated by Cu2+ binding to the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Therefore, in addition to metal selectivity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, an emerging challenge for copper chelators is to prevent the formation of neurotoxic Cu2+-Aβ species without perturbing the neuroprotective Cu2+-PrPC interaction. Previously, we reported the design of a tetrapeptide (TP) that withdraws Cu2+ from Aβ(1-16) and impacts the Cu2+-induced aggregation of Aβ(1-40). In this study, we improved the drug-like properties of TP in a BBB model, evaluated the metal selectivity of the optimized peptide (TP*), and tested its effect on Cu2+ coordination to PrPC and proteins involved in copper trafficking, such as copper transporter 1 and albumin. Our results show that changing the stereochemistry of the first residue prevents TP degradation in the BBB model and coadministration of TP with a peptide that increases BBB permeability allows its passage through the BBB model. TP* is highly selective toward Cu2+ in the presence of Zn2+ ions, transfers Cu2+ to copper-trafficking proteins, and forms a ternary TP*-Cu2+-PrP species that does not perturb the physiological conformation of PrP and displays only a minor impact in the neuroprotective Cu2+-dependent interaction of PrPC with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Overall, these results show that TP* displays desirable features for a copper chelator with therapeutic potential against AD. Moreover, this is the first study that explores the effect of a Cu2+ chelator with therapeutic potential for AD on Cu2+ coordination to PrPC (an emerging key player in AD pathology), integrating recent knowledge about metalloproteins involved in AD with the design of copper chelators against AD.",

The CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, a biomarker combining information from both pathophysiological processes, has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring disease progression, even at pre-clinical stages. Here, we studied the association between the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio with downstream markers of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease progression including brain structure, glucose metabolism, fibrillary Aβ deposition and cognitive performance in 234 cognitively unimpaired individuals, who underwent cognitive testing, a lumbar puncture, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-flutemetamol PET scanning. We evaluated both main effects and interactions with Alzheimer's disease risk factors, such as older age, female sex and the apoliporoptein E (APOE)-ɛ4 allele, in a priori defined regions of interest and further examined the associations on the whole-brain using voxel-wise regressions. In addition, as the association between CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and brain structure and function may be non-linear, we tested the interaction between the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio and stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease defined using the amyloid (A) and tau (T) classification. We found significantly positive associations between CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and both cortical Aβ deposition and regional grey matter volume while no effect was observed for brain metabolism. A significant interaction with age indicated that, for the same level of CSF p-tau/Aβ42, older individuals displayed both increased Aβ deposition and lower grey matter volume, in widespread cortical areas. In addition, we found that women compared with men had a greater Aβ fibrillary accumulation in midline cortical areas and inferior temporal regions, for the same level of the CSF biomarker. The impact of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 on grey matter volume was modulated by AT stages, with A+T+ individuals displaying significantly less positive associations in areas of early atrophy in the Alzheimer's continuum. Finally, we found that sex and APOE-ɛ4 modulated the association between the CSF biomarker and episodic memory as well as abstract reasoning, respectively. Our data indicate that the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio is strongly associated with multiple downstream neuropathological events in cognitively unimpaired individuals and may thus serve as a potent biomarker to investigate the earliest changes in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease. Given that its impact on both Aβ deposition and grey matter volume is modulated by specific risk factors, our results highlight the need to take into account such predisposing variables in both clinical practice and prevention trials.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Quantitative global or regional brain imaging measurements, known as imaging-specific or -derived phenotypes (IDPs), are commonly used in genotype-phenotype association studies to explore the genomic architecture of the brain and how it may be affected by neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), mental health (e.g., depression), and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). For this purpose, medical images have been used as IDPs using a voxel-wise or global approach via principal component analysis. However, these methods have limitations related to multiple testing or the inability to isolate high variation regions, respectively. METHODS: To address these limitations, this study investigates a localized, principal component analysis-like approach for dimensionality reduction of cross-sectional T1-weighted MRI datasets utilizing diffeomorphic morphometry. This approach can reduce the dimensionality of images while preserving spatial information and enables the inclusion of spatial locality in the analysis. In doing so, this method can be used to explore morphometric brain changes across specific components and spatial scales of interest and to identify associations with genome regions in a multivariate genome-wide association study. For a first clinical feasibility study, this method was applied to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, including adolescents with ADHD (n = 1,359), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 1,752), and depression (n = 1,766). RESULTS: Meaningful associations of specific morphometric features with genome regions were identified with the data and corresponded to previous found brain regions in the respective mental health and neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts. DISCUSSION: In summary, the localized, principal component analysis-like approach can reduce the dimensionality of medical images while still being able to identify meaningful local brain region alterations that are associated with genomic markers across multiple scales. The proposed method can be applied to various image types and can be easily integrated in many genotype-phenotype association study setups.",

The abundance of these modifications increases under high metabolic activity or stress conditions and can dramatically impact protein structure and function. Although protein quality control mechanisms typically mitigate the effects of these impaired proteins, in long-lived and degradation-resistant proteins, nPTMs accumulate. In some cases, such as cataract development and diabetes, clear links between nPTMs, aging, and disease progression have been established. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, a key question is whether accumulation of nPTMs is a cause or consequence of protein aggregation. This review focuses on major nPTMs found on proteins with central roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as α-synuclein, β-amyloid, and tau. We summarize current knowledge on the formation of these modifications and discuss their potential impact on disease onset and progression. Additionally, we examine what is known to date about how nPTMs impair cellular detoxification, repair, and degradation systems. Finally, we critically discuss the available methodologies to systematically investigate nPTMs at the molecular level and outline suitable approaches to study their effects on protein aggregation. We aim to foster more research into the role of nPTMs in neurodegeneration by adapting methodologies that have proven successful in studying enzymatic posttranslational modifications.

    "AbstractText": "The effect of digestion on nanocarriers will affect the release and pharmacological effects of bioactive compounds in delivery systems. The digestion of cellulose is limited to gut microbiota, which offers a new research strategy for targeted delivery of bioactive compounds. Herein, positively charged cellulose-like chitosan/polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofiber was prepared to improve the residence time, colon target and gut microbiota regulation activity of quercetin decorated selenium nanoparticles (QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs). Selenium nanoparticles block the degradation of quercetin and QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs only decompose when caused by chitosanase secretion from gut microbiota. In vivo imaging showed that the residence time of QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs was longer than that of QUE@SeNPs. Thus, it significantly decreased the lipid concentrations in liver, which further inhibited insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs treatment improves gut barrier integrity, increased the relative abundance of anti-obesity and anti-inflammation related bacterial including Akkermansia, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides. Consequently, the inflammatory factor (IL-β and TNF-α) levels in gut, liver and brain were also decreased. Nissl and PSD-95 staining indicated that QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs ameliorated synapse dysfunction in the brain. Therefore, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs has a greater effect than QUE@SeNPs in improving cognitive ability in Morris water maze. Overall, QUE@SeNPs/CS/PVPNFs with prolonged residence time attenuates cognitive disorder via gut-liver-brain axis in AD.",

    "AbstractText": "The deposition of aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) is considered as a key factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Previously, we demonstrated that a carboxylated Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) inhibits Aβ fibril formation, consequently protects neurons in culture. This study evaluated the effects of ZnPc on pathological changes in an AD mouse model (J20). Nine-month-old J20 mice received weekly intraperitoneal injection of ZnPc (2 and 4 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed using Y-maze and open field tests. ZnPc levels in the tissues were evaluated using near-infrared microscopy and spectroscopy. ZnPc accumulated primarily in the liver and kidney. A considerable amount was also detected in brain tissue, where it co-localized with neurons, microglia, and extracellularly deposited Aβ. ZnPc treatment (2 mg/kg) significantly improved cognitive functions of J20 mice. Immunostaining results showed that Aβ was positive intracellularly in neurons, and extracellularly around the vessels and parenchyma in the cortex and hippocampus of PBS-treated J20 mice, which was significantly decreased in ZnPc-treated J20 mice in a dose-dependent manner. Nissl staining demonstrated that neuronal numbers were increased both in the cortex and hippocampus. GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba-1 positive microglia were decreased by ZnPc treatment. Also, vessel numbers were increased in ZnPc-treated groups. In PBS-treated group, aquaporin 4 immunopositive area extended beyond STL-positive vessels into the parenchyma, which was confined primarily around the vessels in the ZnPc-treated group. Claudin 5 levels were increased in ZnPc-treated group. Therefore, ZnPc can decrease brain Aβ deposition in J20 mice, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

Proteome profiling was done using supervised machine learning. We found an APOE4-specific proteome signature that was independent of cognitive diagnosis and AD pathological biomarkers, and increased the risk of progression to cognitive impairment. Proteins were enriched in brain regions including the caudate and cortex and cells including endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Enriched peripheral immune cells included T cells, macrophages, and B cells. APOE4 carriers have a unique CSF proteome signature associated with a strong brain and peripheral immune and inflammatory phenotype that likely underlies APOE4 carriers' vulnerability to cognitive decline and AD as they age.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Progress of Chinese Medicine in Regulating Microglial Polarization against Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by a subtle onset and a spectrum of cognitive and functional declines. The clinical manifestation of AD encompasses memory deficits, cognitive deterioration, and behavioral disturbances, culminating in a severe impairment of daily living skills. Despite its high prevalence, accounting for 60-70% of all dementia cases, there remains an absence of curative therapeutics. Microglia (MG), the resident immune cells of the CNS, exhibit a bifurcated role in AD pathogenesis. Functioning in a neuroprotective capacity, MGs express scavenger receptors, facilitating the clearance of [Formula: see text]-amyloid protein (A[Formula: see text]) and cellular debris. Conversely, aberrant activation of MGs can lead to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby propagating neuroinflammatory responses that are detrimental to neuronal integrity. The dynamics of MG activation and the ensuing neuroinflammation are pivotal in the evolution of AD. Chinese medicine (CM), a treasure trove of traditional Chinese cultural practices, has demonstrated significant potential in the therapeutic management of AD. Over the past triennium, CM has garnered considerable research attention for its multifaceted approaches to AD, including the regulation of MG polarization. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the origins, polarization dynamics, and mechanistic interplay of MG with AD pathology. It further explores the nexus between MG polarization and cardinal pathological hallmarks of AD, such as A[Formula: see text] plaque deposition, hyperphosphorylation of tau, synaptic plasticity impairments, neuroinflammation, and brain-gut-axis dysregulation. The review also encapsulates the therapeutic strategies of CM, which encompass monomers, formulae, and acupuncture. These strategies modulate MG polarization in the context of AD treatment, thereby providing a robust theoretical framework in which to conduct future investigative endeavors in both the clinical and preclinical realms.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is one of the primary contributors to the pathogenesis of AD. Withanolides, the main constituents in the leaves of Datura stramonium L., exhibit anti-neuroinflammatory activity. It is unknown if total withanolide from Datura stramonium L. leaves (TWD) reduces nerve inflammation and potentially mitigates the pathogenic elements of AD. This study examined the potential effects of TWD on neuroinflammation in triple transgenic AD (3 × Tg-AD) mice and LPS-induced BV-2, as well as associated signaling pathways. HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used in this study to examine the main chemical components of the TWD extract. 3 × Tg-AD as in vivo AD models and LPS induce BV-2 cells in vitro AD models. The molecular process was investigated by ELISA, WB, IHC, and IF. In 3 × Tg-AD mice, TWD dramatically ameliorates cognitive impairment. Treatment with TWD can counteract the increased activation of microglia and Aβ deposits observed in 3 × Tg-AD mice. Further research indicates that TWD can enhance TOM 1 and mitigate inflammatory responses by reducing the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL1R1, and IL-18. Additionally, TWD may inhibit neuroinflammation through the pathways of IL1R1/MyD88/NF-κB and NLRP3/IL-1β/IL1R1. In summary, this study reveals for the first time that TWD effectively improves cognitive deficits in 3 × Tg-AD mice by modulating the IL1R1/MyD88/NF-κB and NLRP3/IL-1β/IL1R1 pathways. It also alleviates excessive activation of microglia and suppresses Aβ accumulation. Therefore, TWD has the potential as a therapeutic agent for AD.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Robust, fully-automated assessment of cerebral perivascular spaces and white matter lesions: a multicentre MRI longitudinal study of their evolution and association with risk of dementia and accelerated brain atrophy.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Perivascular spaces (PVS) on brain MRI are surrogates for small parenchymal blood vessels and their perivascular compartment, and may relate to brain health. However, it is unknown whether PVS can predict dementia risk and brain atrophy trajectories in participants without dementia, as longitudinal studies on PVS are scarce and current methods for PVS assessment lack robustness and inter-scanner reproducibility. METHODS: We developed a robust algorithm to automatically assess PVS count and size on clinical MRI, and investigated 1) their relationship with dementia risk and brain atrophy in participants without dementia, 2) their longitudinal evolution, and 3) their potential use as a screening tool in simulated clinical trials. We analysed 46,478 clinical measurements of cognitive functioning and 20,845 brain MRI scans from 10,004 participants (71.1 ± 9.7 years-old, 56.6% women) from three publicly available observational studies on ageing and dementia (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database, and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). Clinical and MRI data collected between 2004 and 2022 were analysed with consistent methods, controlling for confounding factors, and combined using mixed-effects models. FINDINGS: Our fully-automated method for PVS assessment showed excellent inter-scanner reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.8). Fewer PVS and larger PVS diameter at baseline predicted higher dementia risk and accelerated brain atrophy. Longitudinal trajectories of PVS markers differed significantly in participants without dementia who converted to dementia compared with non-converters. In simulated placebo-controlled trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline, screening out participants at low risk of dementia based on our PVS markers enhanced the power of the trial independently of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. INTERPRETATION: These robust cerebrovascular markers predict dementia risk and brain atrophy and may improve risk-stratification of patients, potentially reducing cost and increasing throughput of clinical trials to combat dementia.

We investigate Single-Metal (SM), Dual-Metal (DM), and Tri-Metal Double Gate (DG) configurations, where cavities have been created by etching the oxide layer underneath the gate to immobilize grey matter samples collected through Solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Healthy and AD-affected grey matter have different dielectric characteristics at high frequencies. The dielectric constant of the etched nanocavities changes when the sample, which was formerly filled with air, is immobilized in the nanocavities. The alteration in the device drain current as well as performance at 2.4 GHz has been connected to the specimen's modified dielectric constant. To distinguish between the grey matter samples from AD patients and healthy individuals, the ION/IOFF of the suggested device along with the variation in device drain current, has been utilized as the foundation for the identification. The SM configuration has been examined by varying the cavity orientation and gate oxide stacking. To monitor the functioning of the suggested devices, the gate metal of the DM and TM devices has been altered, and a comparison has been made between SM, DM, and TM structures.

It first constructs a brain region-gene association network based on brain region fMRI time series and gene SNP data. Then it integrates the absolute and relative positions of the brain region time series to obtain a new brain region time series containing temporal information. Then long-range and local association features between brain regions and genes are sequentially aggregated by multi-stream cross-attention and graph convolutional networks. Finally, the learned brain region and gene features are input to the fully connected network to predict AD types. Experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that our model outperforms other methods in AD classification tasks.

As such, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic testing has become more commonly used to identify individuals' susceptibility to AD. An underrepresented population in AD research, Latinos will be disproportionately affected by AD in the coming decades. To better aid efforts in education and genetic risk counseling for Latino populations, we must first understand the anticipated psychological and behavioral consequences of APOE genetic risk counseling. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 216 Latinos between the ages of 40 and 64 (average age = 53 years) in northern Manhattan to ascertain their hypothetical reactions to learning that they had a higher risk of developing AD compared to other Latinos within their community. Responses were categorized as emotional, practical, and mixed responses. Among our sample, women were more likely to anticipate an emotional response to hearing that they had a higher risk of AD, and participants above the age of 60 were more likely to anticipate disclosing their risk information to immediate family members. Findings support the tailoring of genetic risk counseling sessions across different ethnic groups, genders and age groups. Future work may include the development of psychological and practical support tools for Latinos seeking APOE genetic testing and counseling.",

Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic tools, such as MRI and PET scans, are costly and less accessible. This study aims to develop an automated, cost-effective digital diagnostic approach using deep learning (DL) and computer-aided detection (CAD) methods for early AD identification and classification. METHODS: The proposed framework utilizes pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, integrated with two classifiers: multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). A dataset categorized into four groups-non-demented, very mild demented, mild demented, and moderate demented-was employed for evaluation. To optimize the classification process, a texture-based algorithm was applied for feature reduction, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing processing time. RESULTS: The system demonstrated high statistical performance, achieving an accuracy of 91%, precision of 95%, and recall of 90%. Among the initial set of twenty-two texture features, seven were identified as particularly effective in differentiating normal cases from mild AD stages, significantly streamlining the classification process. These results validate the robustness and efficacy of the proposed DL-based CAD system. CONCLUSION: This study presents a reliable and affordable solution for early AD detection and diagnosis. The proposed system outperforms existing state-of-the-art models and offers a valuable tool for timely treatment planning. Future research should explore its application to larger, more diverse datasets and investigate integration with other imaging modalities, such as MRI, to further enhance diagnostic precision.",

Previous studies have explored various data imputation approaches on AD data, but the systematic evaluation of deep learning algorithms for imputing heterogeneous and comprehensive AD data is limited. This study investigates the efficacy of denoising autoencoder-based imputation of missing key features of heterogeneous data that comprised tau-PET, MRI, cognitive and functional assessments, genotype, sociodemographic, and medical history. The authors focused on extreme (≥40%) missing at random of key features which depend on AD progression; identified as the history of a mother having AD, APoE ε4 alleles, and clinical dementia rating. Along with features selected using traditional feature selection methods, latent features extracted from the denoising autoencoder are incorporated for subsequent classification. Using random forest classification with 10-fold cross-validation, robust AD predictive performance of imputed datasets (accuracy: 79%-85%; precision: 71%-85%) across missingness levels, and high recall values with 40% missingness are found. Further, the feature-selected dataset using feature selection methods, including autoencoder, demonstrated higher classification score than that of the original complete dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of autoencoder in imputing crucial information for reliable AD prediction in AI-based clinical decision support systems.",

Patients were selected among the patients diagnosed with probable sporadic late onset AD according to the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke AD and related disorders association criteria and the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (n=451). In our 213 sporadic AD patients who were followed up regularly and had a follow up examination in the last 6 months, the file records were examined, scanned and questioned for the presence of epileptic seizures.

In this study, we performed cross-sectional surveys using large-scale patient and caregiver data to identify the prevalence and average impact of symptoms and symptomatic themes experienced by adults with AD, MCI, and dementia. Subsequent analyses were used to determine which demographic and disease-specific factors are associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Fifteen adults with AD (6), MCI (8), and dementia (1) and 15 caregivers of adults with AD (7), MCI (6), and dementia (2) participated in qualitative interviews providing 1,166 and 1,097 unique quotes pertaining to symptom burden. Using open-ended questions from a comprehensive interview guide, participants were asked to identify the symptoms of AD that have the greatest effect on their lives or the lives of the individual for whom they provide care. A cross-sectional survey was then implemented inquiring about the potential symptoms of importance identified during preliminary qualitative interviews. Four-hundred thirty-three individuals (patients and caregivers) participated in the cross-sectional survey, providing more than 35,000 symptom rating responses. Subsequent analyses were conducted to determine how demographic and disease-specific characteristics correlate with symptomatic theme prevalence. RESULTS: The most frequent symptomatic themes reported by individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia in the cross-sectional survey were memory problems (99.0%), problems thinking (90.3%), and communication difficulties (80.4%). Patients identified decreased satisfaction in social situations (1.45), fatigue (1.45), and memory problems (1.41) as the most impactful symptomatic themes (range 0-4). Patient-reported symptomatic theme prevalence was strongly associated with the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurologic disability.

In this study, we focus on investigating the efficacy of tACS and tDCS in entraining intrinsic cortical network oscillations through a computational model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a 2D computational cortical neuron model with 2000 neurons (1600 pyramidal and 400 inhibitory), based on the Izhikevich neuron model. The network was structured to generate low-frequency oscillations, particularly within the delta (4 Hz) range. Both tACS and tDCS were simulated to assess their effect on network synchronization. An algorithm was employed to extract the network's intrinsic frequency and align stimulation frequencies accordingly. RESULTS: Our model successfully generated 4 Hz oscillations, characteristic of delta waves, associated with sleep states. t-ACS stimulation enhanced the power of the 4 Hz frequency, achieving effective synchronization with the intrinsic network dynamics. In contrast, tDCS failed to increase the power of 4 Hz oscillations and disrupted the excitatory-inhibitory balance of the network, reducing connectivity and synchronization. Our results demonstrate that tACS effectively enhances network synchronization and maintains excitatory-inhibitory balance by aligning with the network's intrinsic oscillatory frequency. In contrast, tDCS disrupts these dynamics, reducing connectivity and failing to entrain the target frequency. These findings suggest that tACS may hold greater potential for applications requiring precise network synchronization, while tDCS may have distinct but more limited efficacy in influencing oscillatory activity. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the superior efficacy of tACS over tDCS in enhancing the synchronization of cortical networks by entraining intrinsic frequencies. Future research may extend this model by incorporating long-term plasticity mechanisms to better understand tES effects over longer time scales.",

However, the accurate detection of glycosylated amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins, which serve as important biomarkers for AD, remains challenging due to their extremely low levels. To address these issues, we proposed a method for fabricating a flexible and stable sensor platform based on an innovative boronic acid-based covalent organic framework COF-B(OH)2. After in situ formation on carbon cloth (CC) by facile interfacial perturbation, this CC-based COF substrate could further serve as an electrochemical platform for detecting glycosylated-Aβ16 via molecular interactions.

Furthermore, poly(thymine)-templated copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) linked to the aptamer of glycosylated-Aβ16 were employed as electrochemical probes, providing an amplified signal. The proposed assay for the detection of glycosylated-Aβ16 proteins demonstrated a wide detection range of 5-1800 pg/mL, with an ultralow detection limit of 0.32 pg/mL and high stability.

Yet, the mechanisms by which microglia can drive neurodegeneration remain unresolved. Here, we discover that a conserved stress signaling pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), characterizes a microglia subset with neurodegenerative outcomes. Autonomous activation of ISR in microglia is sufficient to induce early features of the ultrastructurally distinct \"dark microglia\" linked to pathological synapse loss. In AD models, microglial ISR activation exacerbates neurodegenerative pathologies and synapse loss while its inhibition ameliorates them. Mechanistically, we present evidence that ISR activation promotes the secretion of toxic lipids by microglia, impairing neuron homeostasis and survival in vitro. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of ISR or lipid synthesis mitigates synapse loss in AD models. Our results demonstrate that microglial ISR activation represents a neurodegenerative phenotype, which may be sustained, at least in part, by the secretion of toxic lipids.",

Different doses (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg) and injection methods (subcutaneous/intraperitoneal/gavage injection) of tamoxifen were used to induce the construction of NCSTN knockout mice (mice model). The expressions of nicastrin, NICD1, hes1 in skin, brain, and liver tissue in mice model and wild-type (WT) mice were measured by qRT-PCR and IHC. RESULTS: The construction of mice model was successfully induced by tamoxifen, knockout efficiency was 93%, there was no difference in knockout efficiency among three doses, injection methods, genders (P > 0.05). HS-like lesions appeared on the skin of NCSTN knockout mice after 1 month of treatment with tamoxifen, male mice had a higher number of skin lesions compared to female mice (male vs female = 76.5% vs 41.7%, P = 0.027). Compared with WT mice, the expressions of nicastrin (skin P = 0.0009, brain P = 0.0194, liver P = 0.0066), NICD1 (skin P = 0.0115, brain P = 0.0307, liver P = 0.008), hes1 (skin P = 0.0476, brain P = 0.0143, liver P = 0.0003) in mice model all decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The NCSTN knockout mouse might be employed as HS animal model; Reducing nicastrin may affect the expression of notch1-hes1 pathway molecules in skin, brain, and liver tissues; low dose (10 mg/kg/d) tamoxifen could be used to induce the deletion of the target gene in mice.",

    "ArticleTitle": "3-Dimensional morphological characterization of neuroretinal microglia in Alzheimer's disease via machine learning.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects 47.5 million people worldwide. AD is characterised by the formation of plaques containing extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins (pTau). Aβ gradually accumulates in the brain up to 20 years before the clinical onset of dementia, making it a compelling candidate for early detection of AD. It has been shown that there is increased deposition of Aβs in AD patients' retinas. However, little is known about microglia's ability to function and clear Aβ within the retina of AD and control eyes. We labelled microglia with ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) in AD and age-matched control donor retinas. We then used interactive machine learning to segment individual microglia in 3D. In the temporal mid-peripheral region, we found that the number of microglia was significantly lower in AD retinas compared to controls. Unexpectedly, the size of the microglia was significantly larger in the AD retinas compared to controls. We also labelled retinal microglia for Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68), a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by cells in the monocyte lineage and a marker of phagocytic activity and activated microglia. The size of CD68 + cells was statistically different between AD and control microglial, with CD68 + cells being larger in AD. In contrast, there was no difference in either size or shape for CD68- microglia between the two groups, suggesting an important difference in the active states of CD68 + microglia in AD retina. There was also significantly increased CD68 immunoreactivity in individual microglia within the AD group. Overall, this study reveals unique differences in the size and activity of the retinal microglia, which may relate to their potential chronic activation due to increased levels of Aβs in the AD retina.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment and memory deficit. Even with extensive research and studies, presently, there is no effective treatment for the management of AD. Besides, most of drugs used in the treatment of AD did not avert the AD neuropathology, and the disease still in a progressive status. For example, acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors are associated with many adverse effects, such as insomnia and nightmares. As well, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors augment cholinergic neurotransmission leading to the development of adverse effects related to high acetylcholine level, such as salivation, rhinorrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and seizure. Furthermore, tacrine has poor bioavailability and causes hepatotoxicity. These commonly used drugs do not manage the original causes of AD. For those reasons, natural products were repurposed for the treatment of AD and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been shown that phytochemicals produce neuroprotective effects against the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases by different mechanisms, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Quercetin (QCN) has been reported to exert an effective neuroprotective effect against AD and other neurodegenerative diseases by lessening oxidative stress. In this review, electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for possible relevant studies and article linking the effect of QCN on AD. Findings from this review highlighted that many studies highlighted different mechanistic signaling pathways regarding the neuroprotective effect of QCN in AD. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism of QCN in AD was not completely clarified. Consequently, this review aims to discuss the molecular mechanism of QCN in AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Tau pathology is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the sequence of events and the form of tau that confers toxicity are still unclear, due in large part to the lack of physiological models of tauopathy initiation and progression in which to test hypotheses. We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy. MAPTInt10+3G>A and MAPTS305N;Int10+3G>A lines show abundant hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but they do not develop seed-competent fibrillar structures. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance.",

Among the various Aβ species that appear during Aβ aggregation, Aβ oligomers are considered the most neurotoxic form. However, the precise mechanisms of their molecular functions within the Aβ aggregation cascade have not been clarified so far. This research aimed to uncover the structural and functional characteristics of globular-shaped Aβ oligomers (gAβO) under in vitro conditions. We performed thioflavin T (ThT) assays on low-molecular-weight (LMW) Aβ42, testing different concentrations of Aβ42 mature fibril (MF) seeds and gAβO. Fibril formation was continuously observed using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) in LMW Aβ42 with different sample conditions. Conformational changes of Aβ42 aggregates in the presence of gAβO was also evaluated using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results of the ThT analysis and HS-AFM observation indicated that gAβO promoted fibril formation of LMW Aβ42 while gAβO itself did not form fibrous aggregates, indicating that gAβO would have a catalytic effects on LMW Aβ42 aggregation. We also showed that the molecular interaction of gAβO was altered by the presence and amount of MF seeds in the reaction buffers, indicating that complex interactions would exist among different Aβ species. The results of our present research demonstrated that gAβO would have significant roles to accelerate Aβ aggregation in AD pathogenesis. 225 < 250 words.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: As Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) progress, individuals increasingly require assistance from unpaid, informal caregivers to support them in activities of daily living. These caregivers may experience high levels of financial, mental, and physical strain associated with providing care. CareVirtue is a web-based tool created to connect and support multiple individuals across a care network to coordinate care activities and share important information, thereby reducing care burden. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use a computational informatics approach to thematically analyze open text written by AD/ADRD caregivers in the CareVirtue platform. We then explore relationships between identified themes and use patterns. METHODS: We analyzed journal posts (n=1555 posts; 170,212 words) generated by 51 unique users of the CareVirtue platform. Latent themes were identified using a neural network approach to topic modeling. We calculated a sentiment score for each post using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. We then examined relationships between identified topics; semantic sentiment; and use-related data, including post word count and self-reported mood. RESULTS: We identified 5 primary topics in users' journal posts, including descriptions of specific events, professional and medical care, routine daily activities, nighttime symptoms, and bathroom/toileting issues. This 5-topic model demonstrated adequate fit to the data, having the highest coherence score (0.41) among those tested. We observed group differences across these topics in both word count and semantic sentiment. Further, posts made in the evening were both longer and more semantically positive than other times of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Users of the CareVirtue platform journaled about a variety of different topics, including generalized experiences and specific behavioral symptomology of AD/ADRD, suggesting a desire to record and share broadly across the care network. Posts were the most positive in the early evening when the tool was used habitually, rather than when writing about acute events or symptomology. We discuss the value of embedding informatics-based tools into digital interventions to facilitate real-time content delivery.",

    "AbstractText": "Synaptic dysfunction is one of the earliest cellular defects observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), occurring before widespread protein aggregation, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. While the field has focused on the aggregation of Tau and α-Synuclein (α-Syn), emerging evidence suggests that these proteins may drive presynaptic pathology even before their aggregation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which Tau and α-Syn affect presynaptic terminals offers an opportunity for developing innovative therapeutics aimed at preserving synapses and potentially halting neurodegeneration. This review focuses on the molecular defects that converge on presynaptic dysfunction caused by Tau and α-Syn. Both proteins have physiological roles in synapses. However, during disease, they acquire abnormal functions due to aberrant interactions and mislocalization. We provide an overview of current research on different essential presynaptic pathways influenced by Tau and α-Syn. Finally, we highlight promising therapeutic targets aimed at maintaining synaptic function in both tauopathies and synucleinopathies.",

However, quantifying these aggregates in complex biological samples, such as biofluids and postmortem brain tissue, has been challenging due to their low concentration and small size, necessitating the development of methods with high sensitivity and specificity. Here, we have developed ultrasensitive assays utilizing the Quanterix Simoa platform to detect α-synuclein, β-amyloid and tau aggregates, including those with common posttranslational modifications such as truncation of α-synuclein and AT8 phosphorylation of tau aggregates. All assays had a detection limit in the low pM range. As a part of this work, we developed silica-nanoparticle calibrators, allowing for the quantification of all aggregates. These assays were validated for aggregate and target specificity through denaturation and cross-reactivity experiments. We then applied these assays to brain homogenate samples from Alzheimer's disease and control samples, demonstrating their applicability to postmortem tissue. Lastly, we explored the potential of these assays for blood-based diagnostics by detecting aggregates in serum samples from early Alzheimer's disease patients.",

    "AbstractText": "With the advent of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) therapy, precision diagnosis is necessary for identifying appropriate patients with cognitive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease. Therapy with AAMAs requires that candidates be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β, have good physical, psychiatric, and medical health, and lack clinical or biomarker evidence of potentially impactful non-Alzheimer brain disorders. The first three diagnostic activities are the core of the Clinical Practice Guidelines, but the last element of the precision diagnosis requires new decision-making tools for recognizing multi-etiology cognitive impairment. Within the context of shared decision-making between clinician, patient, and family, proper diagnosis is essential. In addition to discussing the benefits and risks of AAMA therapy, the experienced clinician must empathetically assist in bridging the gap between expectations of benefit and the patient's overall diagnostic suitability for AAMA therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: In order to prescribe an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) to the right patients, those selected for treatment should be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β (Aβ), and have good physical, psychiatric, or medical health. Persons with Alzheimer's biology as the primary etiology are the ideal AAMA treatment recipients. A novel activity necessary to optimize therapeutic response is to exclude persons with clinical or biomarker evidence of alternative contributory brain disorders. While mild clinical severity and elevated brain amyloid-β are essential elements for selecting patients for AAMA treatment, clinical judgment is required to weigh the implications of more advanced disease severity, other medical co-morbidities, and the presence of other contributory neuropathologies.",

In particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their derivatives called oxylipins gained specific interest in this context, especially considering their capacity to orchestrate neuroinflammatory responses via direct modulation of microglia. The hippocampus and hypothalamus are crucial brain regions for regulating mood and cognition that are implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and there is ample evidence for the sex-bias in risks for the development as well as sex-bias in the presentation of such psychiatric diseases, including the neuroinflammatory response. To better understand the local PUFA/oxylipin profiles and microglia responses in disease, we here assessed their brain region and sex-dependent profiles in homeostatic brains. In 2-month-old male and female mice, we measured non-esterified (free) PUFA/oxylipin profiles using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and characterized microglia morphology via immunohistochemistry. The hypothalamus and hippocampus exhibit a different free PUFA/oxylipin profile, independent of sex. The hippocampus was characterized by a higher density of complex Iba1+ microglial cells than the hypothalamus, without sex effects. Hypothalamic microglial morphology correlated more strongly with free PUFA- and oxylipin species than hippocampal microglia, correlating with species from both the N-3 and N-6 PUFA metabolization pathways, while hippocampal microglial parameters correlated only with N-6 pathway-related species. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to investigate the relationship between PUFAs, their derivatives and neuroinflammation in the context of diseases.",

To date, eighteen MS4A members have been identified in humans, whereas twenty-three different molecules have been identified in mice. MS4A proteins are selectively expressed on the surfaces of various immune cells, such as B cells (MS4A1), mast cells (MS4A2), macrophages (MS4A4A), Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (MS4A4B), and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (TMEM176A and TMEM176B). Early research confirmed that most MS4A molecules function as ion channels that regulate the transport of calcium ions. Recent studies have revealed that some MS4A proteins also function as chaperones that interact with various immune molecules, such as pattern recognition receptors and/or immunoglobulin receptors, to form immune complexes and transmit downstream signals, leading to cell activation, growth, and development. Evidence from preclinical animal models and human genetic studies suggests that the MS4A superfamily plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer, infection, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases. We review recent progress in this field and focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which different MS4A molecules regulate the progression of tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, in-depth research into MS4A superfamily members may clarify their ability to act as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these diseases. Eighteen distinct members of the MS4A (membrane-spanning four-domain subfamily A) superfamily of four-transmembrane proteins have been identified in humans, whereas the MS4A genes are translated into twenty-three different molecules in mice.

The understanding of the pathological changes requires monitoring of multiple cerebral biomarkers simultaneously with high resolution. Photoacoustic microscopy resolves single capillaries, allowing investigations into the most affected types of vessels. Combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy, the relationship between plaque deposition and small vessel pathology could be better understood. AIM: We aim to introduce a dual-modality imaging system combining photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) to provide a comprehensive view of both cerebral cortical vessels and amyloid- β  ( A β  ) plaque in AD mouse model in vivo and to identify the pathological changes of these two biomarkers. APPROACH: We developed a dual-modality imaging system to image both cerebral vessel structure and A β  plaque on groups of mice with different ages and phenotypes. Vessel imaging is enabled by PAM, whereas A β  plaque is imaged by CFM with the aid of fluorescent dye. RESULTS: The small vessel density in the AD group was significantly lower than in the control group, whereas the A β  plaque density in the AD group was not only higher but also increased with age.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a potential non-invasive AD treatment that may serve as an adjunct therapy with FDA approved medications. METHODS: We conducted a 10-subject open label, single site study evaluating the effect of functional connectivity-resting state functional MRI guided-approach to TMS targeting with dysfunctional LSBNs in subjects with biomarker-confirmed early-stage AD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05292222). Subjects underwent pre-post imaging and testing to assess connectivity dysfunction and cognition. All participants received intermittent theta burst stimulation [(iTBS), (80% motor threshold; 5 sessions per day; 5 days; 3 targets; 18,000 pulses/day)] over 2 weeks. Three Human Connectome Project (HCP) defined parcellations were targeted, with one common right temporal area G dorsal (RTGd) target across all subjects and two personalized. RESULTS: We identified the following parcellations to be dysfunctional: RTGd, left area 8A ventral (L8Av), left area 8B lateral (L8BL), and left area 55b (L55b). There were no changes in these parcellations after treatment, but subjects showed improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status attention index (9.7; p = 0.01). No subject dropped out of the treatment, though 3 participants were unable to tolerate the RTGd target due to facial twitching (n = 2) and anxiety (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Accelerated iTBS protocol was well-tolerated and personalized target-based treatment is feasible in early-stage AD. Further sham-controlled clinical trials are necessary to determine if this is an effective adjunctive treatment in early-stage AD.",

Early detection is crucial for effective management. Machine learning aids in more precise disease identification, potentially transforming healthcare. This comprehensive systematic review discusses how machine learning (ML), can enhance early detection of these disorders, surpassing traditional diagnostics' constraints. METHODS: In this review, databases were examined up to August 15th, 2023, for ML data on neurodegenerative and neurocognitive diseases using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Two investigators used the RAYYAN intelligence tool for systematic reviews to conduct the screening. Six blinded reviewers reviewed titles/abstracts. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Our search found 7,069 research studies, of which 1,365 items were duplicates and thus removed. Four thousand three hundred and thirty four studies were screened, and 108 articles met the criteria for inclusion after preprocessing. Twelve ML algorithms were observed for dementia, showing promise in early detection. Eighteen ML algorithms were identified for Parkinson's, each effective in detection and diagnosis.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia and new therapeutic developments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have created an urgent need for rapid and cost-effective methods to diagnose those affected in the early stages of the disease. Unlike emergency departments, memory clinics lack triage systems, e.g. the Manchester Triage System. METHOD: This retrospective, observational study evaluated the effects of a psychological telephone triage (PTT) system for people requesting an initial assessment at a specialized outpatient memory clinic over a 15-months period in terms of waiting times, staff resources, and as a screening method for cognitive disorders. The PTT consisted of an interdisciplinary pre-screening of available preliminary patient information prior to telephone contact, a semi-structured interview of approximately 30 min with a clinical psychologist, and telephone psychological counseling if there was no indication for an on-site dementia assessment. Based on the PTT interview, patients were triaged using a 4-level priority system (red = acute, yellow = subacute, green = not acute, blue = no indication/counseling). The results were compared with data from the two years prior to the introduction of PTT. RESULTS: The data of 612 people (327 before and 285 after the introduction of PTT) who called the secretary's office between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2024 and requested an initial assessment were analyzed. Of the original sample who called after the introduction of PTT, 66.7% had an indication for an on-site visit and were invited to do so. This was accepted by 51.6%. A further 14% received psychological telephone counseling, resulting in a 34% reduction in on-site visits. Patients triaged as acute cases had the shortest waiting time and presented with the most severe cognitive and functional symptoms at the on-site visit. DISCUSSION: Our study shows that PTT is an effective method to identify patients with urgent need for an initial dementia assessment and to provide psychological counseling as an alternative to on-site visits. We expect that this will reduce the number of emergency admissions and thus the burden on caregivers and the healthcare system. This PTT concept can thus help to better manage the increasing need for initial assessments in the context of new therapies for AD and the increasing prevalence of dementia in general.",

Fractionation of the same total dose (0.4 Gy daily) induced a similar number of γH2AX foci as after acute radiation, however, α- or mixed irradiation caused a higher expression of DNA damage response genes CDKN1A and MDM2 24 h after the last fraction, as well as a stronger decrease in cell viability and clonogenic survival compared to acute exposure. Phosphorylation of STING, followed by phosphorylation of NF-κB subunit p65, was rapidly induced (1 or 3 h, respectively) after the last fraction by all radiation qualities. This led to IL-1β secretion into the medium, strongly elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and enhanced phagocytosis after fractionated exposure to α- and mixed beam-irradiation compared to their acute counterparts 24 h post-irradiation. Nevertheless, all inflammatory changes were returning to basal levels or below 10-14 days post irradiation. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, we demonstrate strong transient pro-inflammatory induction by daily high-LET radiation in a microglia model, triggering phagocytosis which may aid in clearing amyloid beta, but importantly, from a safety perspective, without long-term alterations.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Mutations in genes and precursors of β amyloid (Aβ) are found in the familial form of the disease. This led to the evaluation of seven monoclonal antibodies against Aβ in subjects with AD, two of which were approved for use by the FDA. They caused only a small improvement in cognitive function, probably because they were given to those with much more prevalent sporadic forms of dementia. They also have potentially serious adverse effects. Oxidative stress and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines are present in all subjects with AD and are well correlated with the degree of memory impairment. Drugs that affect these processes include TNFα blocking antibodies and MAPK p38 inhibitors that reduce cognitive impairment when given for other inflammatory conditions. However, their adverse effects and inability to penetrate the brain preclude their use for dementia. Rosiglitazone is used to treat diabetes, a risk factor for AD, but failed in a clinical trial because it was given to subjects that already had dementia. Ladostigil reduces oxidative stress and suppresses the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from activated microglia without blocking their effects. Chronic oral administration to aging rats prevented the decline in memory and suppressed overexpression of genes adversely affecting synaptic function in relevant brain regions. In a phase 2 trial, ladostigil reduced the decline in short-term memory and in whole brain and hippocampal volumes in human subjects with mild cognitive impairment and had no more adverse effects than placebo.",

    "AbstractText": "Regular exercise enhances life quality, lowers the risk of cognitive damage, and slows the advancement of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Natural compounds rich in polyphenols have garnered attention as a non-pharmacological means of treating and preventing AD. The primary component of wine, grape seeds, and nuts is polyphenols. Research suggests that polyphenols slow down the rate of neurodegeneration in AD and lessen learning impairment. Furthermore, polyphenols lessen brain impairments related to cognition. Additionally, polyphenols can specifically restructure amyloid-β (Aβ) structures and soluble oligomers into non-toxic alternative species. They have also been revealed to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factors expression, suggesting that they have a positive impact on the creation of neurotrophins. The benefits of polyphenol supplementation and exercise, which can both provide neuroprotection, have not been well studied in AD patients. This review aimed to investigate the effects of combined exercise polyphenols on inflammation, neuroprotection, several conformational toxic species of Aβ, and Aβ-induced apoptosis in AD.",

    "AbstractText": "BackgroundMost individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) experience one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation which negatively impacts their quality of life. Adapted dance integrates recorded music and movement that is appropriate for people with cognitive limitations. Adapted dance may be an enjoyable activity for persons living with ADRD and may provide psychological and physical benefits.ObjectiveThe purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of an adapted dance intervention with persons with ADRD and the impacts of 12 weeks of adapted dancing on agitation, balance, gait, lower extremity strength, and caregiver burden.MethodsThis study used an experimental design with repeated measures. Participants with ADRD were randomly assigned to a usual care or adapted line dance group that met 60 min twice a week. At pre-test, 4-, 8-, and 12 weeks of intervention, measures were collected for agitation, balance, gait, lower extremity strength, and caregiver burden.ResultsThe sample consisted of 4 males and 12 females (n = 16) with ADRD whose age ranged from 69-97 years. Twelve weeks of adapted line dance was found acceptable by ADRD participants. Participants attended ≥90% of dance sessions and did not experience loss of balance or fall. ADRD participants danced an average of 70 min per week. Both groups had improvements in agitation from baseline to 12 weeks.ConclusionsTwelve weeks of adapted dance was shown to be feasible and enjoyable for persons living with ADRD.

    "ArticleTitle": "Current Updates on Nanotechnology-based Drug Delivery Platforms for Treating Alzheimer's with Herbal Drugs.",
    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder that led to memory loss and disrupts daily life. Earlier strategies to treat AD such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) drugs are not showing effectiveness due to the inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, traditional AChEI provides limited efficacy in terms of bioavailability and solubility for treating AD treatment. Many of the current drugs such as donepezil taken to treat the disease exhibited harmful side effects. Hence, researchers are keen to find the alternative effective therapeutic agents for treating AD. This review summarizes the recent advancement in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems of herbal drugs such as Curcumin, Ginkgo biloba, Salvia officinalis, etc for the prevention and cure of AD. Herbal drugs proved useful in treating neuronal disorders such as AD but exhibited some limitations like low bioavailability via oral drug delivery. Such limitations were overcome by tagging these drugs by nanoparticles which enables them to cross the blood-brain barrier and offer the delivery of greater concentration of herbal drugs to the brain. Inorganic nanoparticle-based drugdelivery systems such as gold nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles, organic nanoparticulate systems like polymeric micelles and dendrimers, and solid polymeric nanoparticles were some of the effective methods that have earlier shown potential for enhancing the delivery of herbal drugs to the brain. Long-term repeated injection of drugs loaded on nanomaterials can lead to the accumulation of nanomaterials in the body without timely and effective degradation which can cause serious issues to the brain. Hence, nanotechnology-based strategies should involve the formulation of nontoxic nanoparticles in such a way that they can significantly transport the drugs across the BBB followed by effective degradation of nanoparticles.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cognitive decline, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cholinergic loss. Due to the limited success of amyloid-targeted therapies, attention has shifted to new non-amyloid targets like phosphodiesterases (PDE). This study investigates the potential of Flemingia vestita (FV) phytomolecules and derivatives, particularly 8-Prenyldaidzein, in AD treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytocompounds and derivatives were screened for drug-likeness, toxicity, BBB permeability, and ADME profiles. Molecular docking was conducted with PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the best binding complexes. RESULTS: 8-Prenyldaidzein, a derivative of daidzein, demonstrated favorable drug-likeness and ADME properties. It exhibited strong binding to PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE, with MD simulations confirming stable protein-ligand interactions. DISCUSSION: The multi-target potential of 8-Prenyldaidzein, particularly through non-amyloid pathways, offers a promising approach to AD therapy. Its inhibition of PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE could address multiple aspects of AD pathology. CONCLUSION: 8-Prenyldaidzein shows strong potential as a multi-target inhibitor for AD treatment.

This study aimed to explore the research frontiers and hotspots through bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Literature related to AD and ferroptosis was collected from the Web of Science Core Collection. Data, including countries, authors, institutions, journals, and keywords, were analyzed by Tableau Public Desktop and Citespace software. RESULTS: A total of 305 articles published between January 1st, 2013, and December 31st, 2023, were included, and the number of articles on the relationship between AD and ferroptosis has increased annually, with the largest number reported from China (162 articles). The articles from Professor SJ Dixon were cited most frequently. Among the top ten most cited articles, four were published in top journals. The University of Melbourne emerged as the institution with the highest number of publications (27 articles). Among the journals, most of the articles were published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience (13 articles, accounting for 4.26%). The co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed that major hotspots in this field contained oxidative stress, cell death, and lipid peroxidation. Keyword burst analysis indicated that antioxidant was the term with the longest duration of high interest, while clustering analysis showed that this research area primarily focused on amyloid precursor protein, drug development, and diagnostic models.

Despite the recent advances in the field of neuroscience, the complex biological mechanisms underlying the aetiology and pathology of AD have not been elucidated yet. The development of amyloid-beta plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation have been identified as important components. The genesis of AD has been illuminated by advances in molecular techniques, which have shown the contributions of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic variables. Ongoing research is focused on the potential of bioactive compounds as therapeutic agents. Quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, huperzine A, ginsenosides, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, zinc, bacosides from brahmi, and withanolide A from ashwagandha are among the compounds that have demonstrated encouraging effects in modifying disease pathways.

Yet, apathy in AD is sometimes underestimated. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search utilized specific keywords related to apathy and Alzheimer's disease (e.g., \"apathy,\" \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"neuropsychiatric symptoms,\" \"front-striatal circuitry\"). The studies were selected based on pre-defined criteria, including publication date (within the last 10 years), peer-reviewed status, and relevance to neurobiological, neurochemical, and behavioral aspects of apathy in AD. The articles were screened through title and abstract reviews, followed by full-text evaluations to ensure they met the inclusion criteria, such as relevance to apathy in Alzheimer's patients, study design rigor, and methodological quality. RESULTS: Some research on the behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of apathy in AD points to the role of the front-striatal circuitry, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, we reviewed the neurochemical, neuropsychological, and neuropathological characteristics believed to be associated with apathy symptoms. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that understanding the intricate neurobiological underpinnings of apathy in AD is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Our analysis suggests that a multimodal approach, incorporating both pharmacological and personalized non-pharmacological strategies, could enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. This highlights the need for future research to explore these combined treatment modalities and their potential to alleviate apathy in AD patients.",

Drosophila melanogaster offers the potential to model features of Alzheimer's disease, study disease mechanisms, and conduct drug screening. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to analyze the neuroprotective properties of the drug \"carnicetine\", which is an acetylated form of the natural low molecular weight compound L-carnitine. The drug is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is currently used as a means of improving cellular metabolism. METHODS: Using tissue-specific drivers, direct expression of amyloid beta peptide (42 amino acids) was exhibited in certain groups of neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster brain, namely in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. The effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (carnicetine) on the death of these neurons and the memory of flies was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of amyloid beta peptide in dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons resulted in neurodegeneration of cholinergic neurons in the Drosophila brain and memory impairment. The use of carnicetine added to animal food made it possible to treat these disorders. At the same time, no effect on dopaminergic neurons was noted. CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirmed the neuroprotective properties of the drug under study, demonstrating its participation in the restoration of the cholinergic system and the feasibility of using carnicetine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Sense of coherence (SOC) is a disposition to perceive things as comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. Lower SOC is associated with subjective burden and psychological morbidity in family caregivers, including in dementia. However, the evidence-base mainly comprises small-scale or cross-sectional studies. More should be known about SOC stability, causal relationships, and international contexts. We aimed to study longitudinal links between dementia caregivers' SOC, subjective burden, and anxiety and depression symptoms in a multinational sample. METHODS: We analyzed the EU-Actifcare cohort (451 dyads of community-dwelling people with mild-moderate dementia and their caregivers). Caregivers' assessments included: SOC scale, Relatives' Stress Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A cross-lagged panel model was used to investigate associations between these measures at baseline, 6 and 12-month follow-ups, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: Caregivers' subjective burden, anxiety and depression symptoms increased over time, SOC remaining overall stable. Considering the first six-month follow-up, we found bidirectional relationships between SOC and subjective burden, and SOC and anxiety symptoms, while lower SOC predicted depression symptoms but not vice versa. For the remaining follow-up period, both anxiety and depression symptoms predicted lower SOC but not vice versa. LIMITATIONS: Convenience sampling precludes full generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: This large longitudinal study shed more light on interplays between SOC, subjective burden and mental health outcomes in dementia caregivers. Findings were consistent with SOC potential protective role against burden and psychological morbidity. However, they also supported reverse causality regarding part of the associations. Caregivers' SOC levels may be directly influenced by subjective burden and psychological morbidity.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the co-expression of multiple CSF biomarkers will help the identification of AD-like phenotypes when biomarker positivity thresholds are not met yet. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy cognitively unimpaired adults with family history (FH) of sporadic AD (mean age = 60.6 ± 4.85 years, 64.8% women) underwent lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (n = 266) and positron emission tomography imaging (n = 239) protocols, and clinical evaluations. CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL40, GFAP, S100, α-Synuclein, SYT1, and SNAP25 were measured. Participants were clustered based on CSF biomarker co-expression with an agglomerative algorithm. The predictive value of the classification against brain and cognitive outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: Three clusters (C) were identified. Higher Aβ burden and CSF p-tau was the hallmark of C1. The other two clusters showed lower Aβ burden but higher expression of glial (C2) or synaptic markers (C3). Participants in C1 showed an AD-like clinical phenotype, comprising participants with the overall highest percentage of two parent FH and APOE-ε4 carriers, in addition to comprising more females compared to C2. C3 displayed better vascular health compared to C1. C2 were older and comprised a lower percentage of females compared to C3. C1 showed an AD-like gray matter reduction in medial temporal (notably hippocampus) and frontal regions that were not observed in Aβ42/40 + compared with Aβ42/40 - . Furthermore, Aβ42/40 - participants in C1 showed GM reduction in inferior temporal areas compared with Aβ42/40 + participants overall. C1 membership also predicted cognitive decline in executive function, but not memory, beyond Aβ + status, overall suggesting a better prognosis in Aβ42/40 + participants without C1 membership. Additionally, C1 displayed a higher rate of conversion to Aβ + (25%) over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that examining multiple CSF biomarkers reflecting diverse pathological pathways may complement and/or outperform AD core biomarkers and thresholding approaches to identify individuals showing a clinical and cognitive AD-like phenotype, including higher conversion to Aβ + , GM reductions and cognitive decline. The clinical utility of this approach warrants further investigation and replication in other cohorts.",

    "AbstractText": "A high-fat diet (HFD) induces obesity and insulin resistance, which may exacerbate amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) pathology during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) accumulate in obese or insulin-resistant patients and animal models. However, roles of accumulated BCAAs and their metabolites, branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs), in the HFD-induced deterioration of AD and the underlying mechanisms remains largely unclear. In this study, APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were fed a HFD for 6 months, and the BCAAs content of the HFD was adjusted to 200% or 50% to determine the effects of BCAAs. The HFD-fed APP/PS1 mice accumulated BCAAs and BCKAs in the serum and cortex, which was accompanied by more severe cognitive deficits and AD-related pathology. The additional or restricted intake of BCAAs aggravated or reversed these phenomena. Importantly, BCAAs and BCKAs repressed microglial phagocytosis of Aβ in vivo and in BV2 cells, which might be relevant for triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) dysfunction and autophagy deficiency. We found that BCAAs and BCKAs could bind to TREM2 in silico, in pure protein solutions and in the cellular environment. These molecules competed with Aβ for binding to TREM2 so that the response of TREM2 to Aβ was impaired. Moreover, BCAAs and BCKAs decreased TREM2 recycling in an mTOR-independent manner, which might also lead to TREM2 dysfunction. Our findings suggest that accumulated BCAAs and BCKAs contribute to the HFD-induced acceleration of AD progression through hypofunctional TREM2-mediated disturbances in Aβ clearance in microglia. Lowering BCAAs and BCKAs levels may become a potential dietary intervention for AD.",

This study aimed to explore the molecular intersections between TBI and AD, focusing on the role of adipose mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC)-derived exosomes and hub genes involved in microglial polarization. Transcriptome profiles from TBI (GSE58485) and AD (GSE74614) datasets were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The hub genes were validated in independent datasets (GSE180811 for TBI and GSE135999 for AD) and localized to specific cell types using single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing data (GSE160763 for TBI and GSE224398 for AD). Experimental validation was conducted to investigate the role of these genes in microglial polarization using cell culture and ADMSC-derived exosomes interventions. Our results identified three hub genes-Bst2, B2m, and Lgals3bp-that were upregulated in both TBI and AD, with strong associations to inflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and tissue repair processes. scRNA sequencing revealed that these genes are predominantly expressed in microglia, with increased expression during M1 polarization. Knockdown of these genes reduced M1 polarization and promoted M2 phenotype in microglia. Additionally, ADMSC-derived exosomes attenuated M1 polarization and downregulated the expression of hub genes. This study provides novel insights into the shared molecular pathways between TBI and AD, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating neuroinflammation and promoting recovery in both conditions.",

As such, de novo mutations in ADNP lead to syndromic autism and somatic ADNP mutations parallel Alzheimer's disease progression. Furthermore, clinical trials with the ADNP fragment NAP (the investigational drug davunetide) showed efficacy in women suffering from the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy and differentially boosted memory in men (spatial) and women (verbal), exhibiting prodromal Alzheimer's disease. While autism is more prevalent in boys and Alzheimer's disease in women, both involve impaired neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether ADNP sex-dependently regulates neurogenesis. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker of neurogenesis, we identified two-fold higher labeling in the hippocampal sub-ventricular zone of ADNP-intact male versus female mice. Adnp haplo-insufficient (Adnp+/-) mice or mice CRSIPR/Cas9-edited to present the most prevalent neurodevelopmental ADNP syndrome mutation, p.Tyr718* (Tyr) showed dramatic reductions in male BrdU incorporation, resulting in mutated females presenting higher labeling than males. Treatment with NAP compensated for the male reduction of BrdU labeling. Mechanistically, hippocampal RNAseq revealed male-specific Tyr down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response genes critical for sex-dependent organogenesis. Newly discovered mitochondrial accessibility of ADNP was inhibited by the Tyr718* mutation further revealing female-specific Tyr downregulation of mitochondrial ATP6. NAP moderated much of the differential expression caused by p.Tyr718*, accompanied by the down-regulation of neurotoxic, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes. Thus, ADNP is a key regulator of sex-dependent neurogenesis that acts by controlling canonical pathways, with NAP compensating for fundamental ADNP deficiencies, striding toward clinical development targeting the ADNP syndrome and related neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic performance of an immunoassay for plasma concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 with visual assessments of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose [18F]FDG-PET in individuals who meet appropriate use criteria for Alzheimer dementia (AD) biomarker assessments. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals with early-onset (age <65 years at onset) and/or atypical dementia (features other than memory at onset), who were evaluated at a tertiary care memory clinic. All participants underwent measurements of CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau181, and total tau levels), as well as [18F]FDG-PET scans, amyloid-PET scans, and plasma p-tau217 quantifications. To determine whether the [18F]FDG-PET images were compatible with AD, images were visually rated by 2 nuclear medicine experts. Using a contingency analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of [18F]FDG-PET scan interpretation and plasma p-tau217 for an AD biomarker profile in CSF and for amyloid-PET positivity. RESULTS: A total of 81 individuals with early onset and/or atypical dementia were included in this study (mean age = 65 years; 48/81 female (59%). Both [18F]FDG-PET and plasma p-tau217 showed high levels of agreement with reference standard AD biomarkers ([18F]FDG-PET area under the curve [AUC]: 71%; plasma p-tau217 AUC: 81%). Although both biomarkers had similar specificity for AD [18F]FDG-PET: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81; plasma p-tau217: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81), plasma p-tau217 had higher sensitivity for AD (plasma p-tau217: 97%, CI: 0.85-0.99 vs [18F]FDG-PET: 73%, CI: 0.57-0.85) (p = 0.01). Overall accuracy was also higher for plasma p-tau217 (AUC = 84%, CI: 0.75-0.93 vs 72%, CI: 0.60-0.83 of [18F]FDG-PET) (p = 0.02). The same pattern of results was observed when using amyloid-PET as the reference standard. DISCUSSION: Our study provides evidence that plasma p-tau217 has strong discriminative accuracy for AD among patients with early-onset and/or atypical dementia assessed in specialized settings. Future work should replicate these findings in secondary care settings.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent degenerative brain disease associated with dementia, requires early diagnosis to alleviate worsening of symptoms through appropriate management and treatment. Recent studies on AD stage classification are increasingly using multimodal data. However, few studies have applied graph neural networks to multimodal data comprising F-18 florbetaben (FBB) amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) images and clinical indicators. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of graph convolutional network (GCN) for AD stage classification using multimodal data, specifically FBB PET images and clinical indicators, collected from Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The effectiveness of GCN was demonstrated through comparisons with the support vector machine, random forest, and multilayer perceptron across four classification tasks (normal control (NC) vs. AD, NC vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI vs. AD). As input, all models received the same combined feature vectors, created by concatenating the PET imaging feature vectors extracted by the 3D dense convolutional network and non-imaging feature vectors consisting of clinical indicators using multimodal feature fusion method. An adjacency matrix for the population graph was constructed using cosine similarity or the Euclidean distance between subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and/or non-imaging feature vectors. The usage ratio of these different modal data and edge assignment threshold were tuned by setting them as hyperparameters. In this study, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com were the GCN models that received the adjacency matrix constructed using cosine similarity (CS) and the Euclidean distance (ED) between the subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and non-imaging feature vectors, respectively. In modified nested cross validation, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 98.40%, 94.58%, 94.01%, 82.63% and 99.68%, 93.82%, 93.88%, 90.43% for the four aforementioned classification tasks using DAUH dataset, outperforming the other models. Furthermore, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 76.16% and 90.11% for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification using ADNI dataset, outperforming the other models. These results demonstrate that GCN could be an effective model for AD stage classification using multimodal data.",

In this study, we established a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via intracerebroventricular injection of fibrillar amyloid-β to investigate the effect of D30 on fibrillar amyloid-β-induced neuropathology. Our results showed that D30 alleviated fibrillar amyloid-β-induced cognitive impairment, promoted fibrillar amyloid-β clearance from the hippocampus and cortex, suppressed oxidative stress, and inhibited activation of microglia and astrocytes. D30 also reversed the fibrillar amyloid-β-induced loss of dendritic spines and synaptic protein expression. Notably, we demonstrated that exogenous fibrillar amyloid-β introduced by intracerebroventricular injection greatly increased galectin-3 expression levels in the brain, and this increase was blocked by D30. Considering the role of D30 in clearing amyloid-β, inhibiting neuroinflammation, protecting synapses, and improving cognition, this study highlights the potential of galectin-3 as a promising treatment target for patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "AbstractText": "Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is emerging as a promising therapeutic agent for neuropathic and other pain-related conditions. This naturally occurring fatty acid has drawn interest because of its ability to regulate pain and inflammation. Initially identified in food sources, PEA has been the subject of extensive research to elucidate its properties, efficacy, and clinical applications. PEA primarily exerts its effects through interaction with its primary receptor PPAR α, this interaction influences pain signalling pathways and neuroinflammatory processes by modulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mast cell degranulation, microglial activation, and decrease of oxidative stress. PEA's interaction with endocannabinoid receptors decreases the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and thereby a descending pain sensation. The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics of PEA are examined in this paper, along with its potential for efficiency when used in in combination additional therapies in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's. Experimental evidence shows that PEA not only reduces pain and inflammation but also lowers the need for higher dosages of other drugs hence minimizing the risk of drug toxicity. The bioavailability of PEA has been enhanced by recent technological developments, which emphasize continuous research efforts to maximize PEA's therapeutic potential in pain treatment and associated medical sectors.",

    "AbstractText": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a common histologic lung cancer with high morbidity and mortality, and most patients have distant metastases at diagnosis. RasGEF Domain Family Member 1C (RASGEF1C) could regulated Alzheimer's disease. However, its function in various cancers, including LUAD, is poorly understood. In the present study, we discovered that high expression of RASGEF1C in LUAD was associated with poorer prognosis, unfavorable histological features, and poorer pathological staging. In addition, RASGEF1C expression was an independent predictor of overall survival, disease specific survival, and progress free interval in patients with LUAD. High expression of RASGEF1C was linked to signaling pathways that are involved in the immune response and cell proliferation, according to KEGG enrichment analysis. Additionally, we verified that RASGEF1C was highly expressed in LUAD cell lines and that RASGEF1C knockdown dramatically decreased the capacity of LUAD cell lines to invade, migrate, and proliferate. Our research provides mechanistic insights into the function of RASGEF1C in the progression of LUAD and suggests that RASGEF1C is a prospective target for future therapy.",

However, the association of immune-mediated diseases with the risk of incident dementia has not been well characterised. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the prospective association of 27 immune-mediated diseases and incident dementia risk and to explore the underlying mechanisms driven by brain structures. METHODS: We included 487 459 UK Biobank participants aged 37-73 years without dementia at enrolment. Immune-mediated diseases and dementia cases were ascertained according to the International Classification of Diseases codes. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression and general linear regression models were used to examine the association of immune-mediated disease with incident dementia risk and brain morphometric measures, respectively. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 1654 cases of incident dementia were documented in 86 243 patients with immune-mediated diseases. Overall, immune-mediated diseases were associated with a higher all-cause dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.32). Five out of 27 immune-mediated diseases were associated with an increased risk of dementia individually. Comorbidity of multiple immune-mediated diseases further increased the risk. Moreover, the immune-mediated disease was associated with smaller total surface areas of both left (β, -286.51; SE, 102.58; P = .014) and right hemispheres (β, -298.56; SE, 103.96; P = .016), greater white matter hyperintensities volume (β, 1.02; SE, 0.13; P < .001) and less healthy white matter microstructures. CONCLUSIONS: Immune-mediated diseases were associated with an increased risk of incident dementia, and the association of those diseases with brain structural abnormalities might provide clues to the underlying mechanisms.",

A cortical signature of EOAD was recently proposed and may facilitate EOAD investigation. Here, we aimed to validate this proposed MRI biomarker of EOAD neurodegeneration in an Appalachian clinical cohort. We also compared differences in EOAD signature atrophy in participants with biomarker-positive EOAD, LOAD, early-onset non-AD pathologies, and cognitively normal individuals. Cortical thinning was reliably detected in eight of nine signature areas of persons with EOAD relative to cognitively normal individuals despite very early disease stage. Additionally, individuals with EOAD showed thinner cortex in most signature regions relative to those with early-onset non-AD pathologies. EOAD and LOAD showed similar cortical atrophy within most EOAD signature regions. Whole-brain vertex-wise cortical analyses supported these findings. Furthermore, signature cortical atrophy showed expected relationships with measures of global and specific cognitive and functional status. This investigation further validates and expands upon the recently defined EOAD signature and suggests its robustness within a rural population, even at early disease stage. Larger scale and longitudinal studies employing this marker of EOAD neurodegeneration are needed to further understand clinical effects and appropriate management of persons with EOAD.",

    "AbstractText": "Oxidative stress is an important driver of aging and has been linked to numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. A key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's are filamentous inclusions made of the microtubule associated protein Tau. Based on alternative splicing, Tau protein can feature either three or four microtubule binding repeats. Distinctively, three-repeat Tau contains a single cysteine; four-repeat Tau contains two. Although there is evidence that the cysteines in pathological Tau filaments exist in the reduced form, very little is known about the alternative disulfide-bonded state. It is unclear whether it can exist nontransiently in the reducing environment of the cytosol. Such knowledge, however, is important as different redox states of Tau could modulate aggregation. To address this question, we transfected HEK293 cells expressing the P301S variant of four-repeat Tau with fibril seeds composed of compact, disulfide-bonded Tau monomers. In vitro, these fibrils are observed to recruit only compact Tau, but not Tau in which the cysteines are reduced or replaced by alanines or serines. In line with this characteristic, the fibrils dissociate when treated with a reducing agent. When offered to HEK293 cells, variant Tau protein is recruited to the seeds forming intracellular fibrils with the same seeding properties as the in vitro counterparts. Markedly, the proteins in these fibrils have a compact, disulfide-bonded configuration and dissociate upon reduction. These findings reveal that uptake of exogeneous fibril seeds triggers oxidation of Tau monomers, modulating intracellular aggregation.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (ALZ) is a neurodegenerative disease that damages neuronal cells and causes decline in cognitive abilities. Administration of cholinesterase inhibitor compounds is the primary choice in the treatment of ALZ, one of which is rivastigmine (RVT). Several routes of administration of RVT are available, such as oral and transdermal. However, in the oral route, RVT has low bioavailability, undergoes first-pass metabolism, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) reduces the therapeutic concentration of RVT. The transdermal route is nonselective target in the brain. This study aims to combine thermosensitive mucoadhesive gel (TG) and lipid microspheres (LM) as a drug delivery system to improve the efficacy of RVT. Combining these will prevent systemic side effects of RVT and increase drug concentration in the brain. LM was formulated with varying concentrations of Compritol polymer. The results of LM evaluation showed the values of particle size, PDI, and %EE and %DL were 8.519 μm, 0.018 ± 0.004, 72.54%, and 76.43%, respectively. The TG formulation can provide a liquid form at room temperature (25 °C) and a gel at nasal temperature (35 °C). Hemolytic and HET-CAM tests confirmed TG RVT LM's safety for use. Ex vivo studies showed controlled and sustained release of TG RVT LM, and in vivo studies showed TG RVT LM a higher pharmacokinetic profile in the brain than oral formulations and injections. The Cmax was found to be 7.05 ± 0.55 μg/cm3, Tmax was 24 h, and AUC0-24, which is related to the effectiveness of brain targeting, was 225.73 μg/cm3. In conclusion, this study shows the successful development of TG RVT LM, as evidenced by improved drug delivery to the brain, which is characterized by higher concentrations of RVT in the brain compared with oral and injectable RVT, this delivery system shows potential as a future treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",

There are currently no specific causes or conditions for this disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess AD prevalence across different stages using machine learning (ML) approaches comprehensively. METHODS: The selection of papers was conducted in 3 phases, as per PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) 2020 guidelines: identification, screening, and final inclusion. The final analysis included 24 papers that met the criteria. The selection of ML approaches for AD diagnosis was rigorously based on their relevance to the investigation. The prevalence of patients with AD at 2, 3, 4, and 6 stages was illustrated through the use of forest plots. RESULTS: The prevalence rate for both cognitively normal (CN) and AD across 6 studies was 49.28% (95% CI 46.12%-52.45%; P=.32). The prevalence estimate for the 3 stages of cognitive impairment (CN, mild cognitive impairment, and AD) is 29.75% (95% CI 25.11%-34.84%, P<.001). Among 5 studies with 14,839 participants, the analysis of 4 stages (nondemented, moderately demented, mildly demented, and AD) found an overall prevalence of 13.13% (95% CI 3.75%-36.66%; P<.001). In addition, 4 studies involving 3819 participants estimated the prevalence of 6 stages (CN, significant memory concern, early mild cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and AD), yielding a prevalence of 23.75% (95% CI 12.22%-41.12%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The significant heterogeneity observed across studies reveals that demographic and setting characteristics are responsible for the impact on AD prevalence estimates. This study shows how ML approaches can be used to describe AD prevalence across different stages, which provides valuable insights for future research.",

We aim to investigate whether the genetic modulation of ε4-related AD risk is reflected in brain morphology. METHODS: We tested whether 27 magnetic resonance imaging-derived neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration (volume and thickness in temporo-limbic regions) are associated with APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 polygenic profiles using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set linked to the AD Genetic Consortium data. RESULTS: All brain regions studied using structural phenotypes were smaller in individuals with AD. The ε4 allele was associated with smaller limbic (entorhinal, hippocampus, parahippocampus) brain volume and cortical thickness in AD cases than controls. There were significant differences in the associations for the higher-risk and lower-risk ε4-bearing APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 profiles with temporo-limbic region markers. DISCUSSION: The APOE-AD heterogeneity may be partly attributed to the modulating role of the TOMM40 and APOC1 genes in the APOE cluster. HIGHLIGHTS: The ε4 allele is associated with smaller values of neuroimaging markers in AD cases. Larger values of neuroimaging markers may protect against AD in the ε4 carriers.

Correlations between key risk factors and circulating neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid β protein (Aβ)40, and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio suggest underlying mechanisms contributing to cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: The common and distinct risk factors across cognitive decline stages emphasize the need for tailored interventions. The correlations with blood biomarkers provide insights into potential management targets. HIGHLIGHTS: From a large community-based cohort study on the residents in Chongqing, we have identified that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia share several common risk factors, including age, female gender, rural living, lower education levels, and a medical history of stroke. However, each condition also has its own unique risk factors. Several factors contribute to the progression of MCI into dementia including age, education levels, occupation, and a medical history of hypertension and epilepsy. We discover the correlations between the risk factors for dementia and blood biomarkers that indicate the presence of axonal damage, glial activation, and Aβ pathology.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) manifests prior to the age of 65, and affects 4%-8% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current analyses sought to examine longitudinal cognitive trajectories of participants with early-onset dementia. METHODS: Data from 307 cognitively normal (CN) volunteer participants and those with amyloid-positive EOAD or amyloid-negative cognitive impairment (EOnonAD) were compared. Cognitive trajectories across a comprehensive cognitive battery spanning 42 months were examined using mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: The EOAD group displayed worse cognition at baseline relative to EOnonAD and CN groups, and more aggressive declines in cognition over time. The largest effects were observed on measures of executive functioning domains, while memory declines were blunted in EOAD. DISCUSSION: EOAD declined 2-4× faster than EOnonAD, and EOAD pathology is not restricted to memory networks. Early identification of deficits is critical to ensure that individuals with sporadic EOAD can be considered for treatment using disease-modifying medications. HIGHLIGHTS: Represents the most comprehensive longitudinal characterization of sporadic EOAD to date. The trajectory of cognitive declines was steep for EOAD participants and worse than for other groups. Executive functioning measures exhibited the greatest declines over time in EOAD.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether the cerebellum develops neuropathology that correlates with well-accepted Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological markers and cognitive status. METHODS: We studied cerebellar cytoarchitecture in a cohort (N = 30) of brain donors. In a larger cohort (N = 605), we queried whether the weight of the contents of the posterior fossa (PF), which contains primarily cerebellum, correlated with dementia status. RESULTS: Although there was no granular layer (GL) cell loss, GL area was lower in AD cases, particularly in the lateral cerebellum. Lower numbers of mossy fiber synaptic terminals in the cerebellar GL of AD cases correlated with Braak stages IV-VI. PF content weight correlated with dementia independently of age, neuropathology, and education. In addition, we found that a measure of the relative size of the PF content weight to total brain weight correlated with less dementia. DISCUSSION: These results confirm that the cerebellum is not spared neuropathological damage in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Novel evidence of cerebellar atrophy in the granule cell layer of the lateral cerebellar cortex (or 'cognitive cerebellum'), and loss of a specific cerebellar synapse type in this region, the cerebellar glomerulus. Both correlated with dementia status and Braak stages IV through VI, in a cohort with complete neuropathological characterization. Although there have been recent brain imaging studies suggesting a role for cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease, we believe our study constitutes some of the most concrete neuropathological evidence to date of anatomic and synaptic substrates that are disrupted in AD. These changes in this cerebellar region may even play a role in the etiology of cognitive symptoms. Novel evidence that individuals with lower postmortem cerebellar weights showed more cognitive decline, independent of classical neuropathology markers such as Braak stage, Thal phase, or Corsortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score, suggesting a role for this brain region in dementia, using advanced statistical analysis of a large unbiased population cohort (n = 605), the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. Conversely, a measure of how intact the cerebellum was correlated with less dementia, independent of classical neuropathology markers and cerebral cortical weight, again, in the ACT cohort of 605 brain donors. We believe that this novel finding has relevance and implications for the identification of resilience factors, which may protect against the development of dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies are characterized by intracellular aggregates of microtubule-associated protein tau that are actively released and promote proteopathic spread. Microglia engulf pathological proteins, but how they endocytose tau is unknown. METHODS: We measured endocytosis of different tau species by microglia after pharmacological modulation of macropinocytosis or clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) or antagonism/genetic depletion of known tau receptors heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). RESULTS: Dynamin inhibition decreased microglial endocytosis of all tested tau species. Meanwhile, HSPG antagonism blocked only fibril uptake, and LRP1 antagonism or genetic depletion inconsistently inhibited the endocytosis of fibrils and monomers. Cre recombinase robustly enhanced tau uptake with partial selectivity for fibrils. DISCUSSION: These data show that microglia take up both tau monomers and aggregates via a dynamin-dependent form of endocytosis (eg, CME) but may differ in using HSPGs for entry depending on species. HIGHLIGHTS: Microglial endocytosis of tau monomers and fibrils is dynamin-dependent. HSPG antagonism blocks microglial uptake of tau fibrils but not monomers. LRP1 antagonism or knockdown inconsistently inhibits tau uptake. TAT-Cre stimulates semi-selective uptake of fibrils over monomers.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: We previously demonstrated that regulating mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) affects axonal Aβ generation in a well-characterized three-dimensional (3D) neural Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. MAMs vary in thickness and length, impacting their functions. Here, we examined the effect of MAM thickness on Aβ in our 3D neural model of AD. METHODS: We employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence-based MAM stabilizers, electron microscopy, Aβ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and live-cell imaging with kymography to assess how stabilizing MAMs of different gap widths influence Aβ production and MAM axonal mobility. RESULTS: Stabilizing tight MAMs (∼6 nm gap width) significantly increased Aβ levels, whereas basal (∼25 nm) and loose MAMs (∼40 nm) maintained or reduced Aβ levels, respectively. Tight MAMs reduced mitochondrial axonal velocity compared to basal MAMs, while loose MAMs showed severely reduced axonal distribution. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that stabilizing MAMs of specific gap widths, particularly in axons, without complete destabilization could be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: The stabilization of MAMs exacerbates or ameliorates Aβ generation from AD neurons in a MAM gap width-dependent manner. A specific stabilization threshold within the MAM gap width spectrum shifts the amyloidogenic process to non-amyloidogenic. Tight MAMs slow down mitochondrial axonal transport compared to lose MAMs offering a quantitative method for measuring MAM stabilization.",

    "AbstractText": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, this work designs a mitochondria-targeted micelle CsA-TK-SS-31 (CTS) to block the progression of AD by simultaneously alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia and neurons. The mitochondria-targeted peptide SS-31 drives cyclosporin A (CsA) to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and delivers CsA to mitochondria of microglia and neurons in the brains of 5 × FAD mice. Under the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) environment in damaged mitochondria of microglia and neurons, the linker (thioketal, TK) between CsA and SS-31 is broken and CsA and SS-31 are released while consuming ROS in the microenvironment. The released CsA and SS-31 synergistically restore the mitochondrial membrane potential and the balance between the fission and fusion of mitochondria, which subsequently protect neurons from apoptosis and reduce the activation of microglia in the brains of 5 × FAD mice. Ultimately, the neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment of 5 × FAD mice are ameliorated. This research provides a synergistic treatment strategy for AD through alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction to reduce neuroinflammation and restore the function of neurons simultaneously.",

Herein we report the discovery of 3-thio-1,2,4-triazole series as selective and high affinity SST4 agonists. Thirty-three compounds show <100 nM binding affinity, five of which had sub-nanomolar binding affinity and >300-fold selectivity over other SST subtypes. SST4 cAMP inhibition assay activity data aligned with the ligand binding affinity. Comparative docking results of the ligands under investigation with the cryo-EM and most recent model-built SST4 structures suggest similar trends in binding. Amino acids responsible for high and moderate affinity were identified, whereas poorer ligand conformations and limited interactions were observed with the low-affinity compounds. In summary, this study presents a novel series of high affinity SST4 agonists with corresponding in vitro activity, demonstrating viable therapeutic potential.",

    "AbstractText": "Tau pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) follows a distinct pattern, beginning in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and spreading to interconnected brain regions. Early-stage tau pathology, characterized by soluble phosphorylated tau, is difficult to study in human brains post-mortem due to rapid dephosphorylation. Rhesus macaques, which naturally develop age-related tau pathology resembling human AD, provide an ideal model for investigating early tau etiology. This study examines the molecular processes underlying tau pathology in the macaque ERC, focusing on calcium and inflammatory signaling pathways. Our findings reveal age-related decreases in PDE4 phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze cAMP and increases in calpain-2 and GCPII that occur in parallel with early-stage tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes (pS214-tau, pT181-tau, pT217-tau). These findings suggest that dysregulated calcium signaling in ERC, beginning in middle-age, primes tau for hyperphosphorylation, potentially driving the early stages of AD, advancing our understanding of how ERC vulnerabilities contribute to neurodegeneration in AD.",

Despite multiple studies reporting this connection, the mechanism by which T2D exacerbates AD is poorly understood. It is challenging to design studies that address co-occurring and comorbid diseases, limiting the number of existing evidence bases. To address this challenge, we expanded the applications of a computational framework called Translatable Components Regression (TransComp-R), initially designed for cross-species translation modeling, to perform cross-disease modeling to identify biological programs of T2D that may exacerbate AD pathology. Using TransComp-R, we combined peripheral blood-derived T2D and AD human transcriptomic data to identify T2D principal components predictive of AD status. Our model revealed genes enriched for biological pathways associated with inflammation, metabolism, and signaling pathways from T2D principal components predictive of AD. The same T2D PC predictive of AD outcomes unveiled sex-based differences across the AD datasets. We performed a gene expression correlational analysis to identify therapeutic hypotheses tailored to the T2D-AD axis. We identified six T2D and two dementia medications that induced gene expression profiles associated with a non-T2D or non-AD state. Finally, we assessed our blood-based T2DxAD biomarker signature in post-mortem human AD and control brain gene expression data from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis, we identified a subset of genes from our cross-disease blood-based biomarker panel that significantly separated AD and control brain samples. Our methodological advance in cross-disease modeling identified biological programs in T2D that may predict the future onset of AD in this population. This, paired with our therapeutic gene expression correlational analysis, also revealed alogliptin, a T2D medication that may help prevent the onset of AD in T2D patients.",

In an AD mouse model, this combination therapy significantly improved memory function and reduced AD-related pathologies compared to vehicle and single-drug treatments. Single-nuclei transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the therapy reversed disease-associated gene networks in a cell-type-specific manner.

Here, we employed a cross-validated machine learning approach and investigated whether integrating subject-specific brain connectome information with Aβ burden measures improves predictive validity for subsequent cognitive decline. Baseline regional Aβ pathology measures from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging predicted prospective cognitive decline. Incorporating structural connectome, but not functional connectome, information into the Aβ measures improved predictive performance. We further identified a neuropathological signature pattern linked to future cognitive decline, which was validated in an independent cohort.

    "AbstractText": "Human aging affects the ability to remember new experiences, in part, because of altered neural function during memory formation. One potential contributor to age-related memory decline is diminished neural selectivity -- i.e., a decline in the differential response of cortical regions to preferred vs. non-preferred stimuli during event perception -- yet the factors driving variability in neural selectivity with age remain unclear. We examined the impact of top-down attention and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology on neural selectivity during memory encoding in 156 cognitively unimpaired older participants who underwent fMRI while performing a word-face and word-scene associative memory task. Neural selectivity in face- and place-selective cortical regions was greater during events that were later remembered compared to forgotten. Critically, neural selectivity during learning positively scaled with memory-related variability in top-down attention, whereas selectivity negatively related to early AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma pTau181. Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity at encoding mediated the effects of age, top-down attention, and pTau181 on associative memory. Collectively, these data reveal multiple pathways that contribute to memory differences among older adults -- AD-independent reductions in top-down attention and AD-related pathology alter the precision of cortical representations of events during experience, with consequences for remembering.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Anemia is a risk factor for dementia development. However, few studies have examined the relationship between brain volume and anemia. This study aimed to analyze the association between anemia and brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging data from brain health checkups. METHOD: Participants underwent brain health checkups between January 2015 and March 2022. Blood samples were collected to measure hemoglobin concentrations and mean corpuscular volumes. The modified Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate cognitive function. Magnetic resonance images were analyzed using voxel-based Morphometry to evaluate the overall patterns of brain volume. After extracting the principal components (PCs) from PC analysis, we investigated their association with MMSE scores and anemia. RESULTS: This study included 1,029 participants and identified principal components, representing smaller volume in the frontal lobe (PC1), and smaller volume in the limbic system to the temporal lobe (PC2). A higher PC2 score was significantly associated with a lower MMSE score. Male participants with anemia had smaller bilateral PC1 volumes and left hippocampal volumes, and female participants with anemia had smaller bilateral PC2 volumes and hippocampus volumes. DISCUSSION: PC2 may represent the extent of disease affecting limbic system volume, such as Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest that anemia may be associated with smaller volumes in the limbic system, especially in women. Further studies are required to determine which type of anemia is more strongly correlated with smaller brain volumes.",

Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether there are common aging genes across organs or tissues, and whether these aging genes play a pivotal role in the development of age-related diseases. METHODS: In this study, we screened for aging genes using RNAseq data of 32 human tissues from GTEx. RNAseq datasets from GEO were used to study whether aging genes drives age-related diseases, or whether anti-aging solutions could reverse aging gene expression. RESULTS: Aging transcriptome alterations showed that brain aging differ significantly from the rest of the body, furthermore, brain tissues were divided into four group according to their aging transcriptome alterations. Numerous genes were downregulated during brain aging, with functions enriched in synaptic function, ubiquitination, mitochondrial translation and autophagy. Transcriptome analysis of age-related diseases and retarding aging solutions showed that downregulated aging genes in the hippocampus further downregulation in Alzheimer's disease but were effectively reversed by high physical activity. Furthermore, the neuron loss observed during aging was reversed by high physical activity. CONCLUSION: The downregulation of many genes is a major contributor to brain aging and neurodegeneration. High levels of physical activity have been shown to effectively reactivate these genes, making it a promising strategy to slow brain aging.",

Enzymes that catalyse the complete breakdown of proteins are known as proteases. The peptide bonds in proteins are degraded by these serine proteases, which cause amyloid disaggregation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We have searched for related articles using the search engines Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus for the past 10 years, selected the relevant articles, and written the outcomes and benefits of protease using the medical topic \"serine protease\" and the following text phrases -keratinase, lumbrokinase, serratiopeptidase, nattokinase. KEY RESULTS: Alkaline serine proteases exhibit activity within the neutral to alkaline pH range. They are most capable of degrading host complement proteins, cytokines, and host clotting factors mostly due to their serine centre or metallotype. Because of its potential usage in food, pharmaceutical, and other industrial domains, this category of enzymes has been extensively investigated. Specifically, serine proteases are a group of enzymes that can be consumed orally and are stable in our gastrointestinal tract.

METHODS: Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and included 1185 adults >55 years of age with plasma p-tau181 and neuropsychological test data. Linear regression models related plasma p-tau181 to neuropsychological composite and SCD scores with follow-up models examining plasma p-tau181 interactions with cognitive diagnosis, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status, age, and sex on cognitive outcomes. RESULTS: Higher plasma p-tau181 level was associated with worse memory, executive functioning, and language abilities, and greater informant-reported SCD.

Affected patients show great heterogeneity in their symptomatic progression, which hampers the identification of efficacious treatments in clinical trials. Using artificial intelligence approaches to enable clinical enrichment trials serves a promising avenue to identify treatments. In this work, we used a deep learning method to cluster the multivariate disease trajectories of 283 early dementia patients along cognitive and functional scores. Two distinct subgroups were identified that separated patients into 'slow' and 'fast' progressing individuals. These subgroups were externally validated and independently replicated in a dementia cohort comprising 2779 patients. We trained a machine learning model to predict the progression subgroup of a patient from cross-sectional data at their time of dementia diagnosis. The classifier achieved a prediction performance of 0.70 ± 0.01 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in external validation. By emulating a hypothetical clinical trial conducting patient enrichment using the proposed classifier, we estimate its potential to decrease the required sample size. Furthermore, we balance the achieved enrichment of the trial cohort against the accompanied demand for increased patient screening. Our results show that enrichment trials targeting cognitive outcomes offer improved chances of trial success and are more than 13% cheaper compared with conventional clinical trials.

Here, we aimed to determine the brain-age gap in genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease and its association with surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathology and with rates of cognitive and motor function decline. We studied 1200 cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, asymptomatic and clinical mutation carriers in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), and normal controls using a cohort study design. For comparison, we studied 187 Alzheimer's disease dementia cases and 254 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. We used Bayesian ANOVA to determine associations of the brain-age gap with diagnosis, and baseline measures of motor and cognitive function, dopamine transporter activity and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease type amyloid-β42 and phosphotau pathology. Associations of brain-age gap with rates of cognitive and motor function decline were determined using Bayesian generalized mixed effect models. The brain-age gap in idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients was 0.7 years compared to controls, but 5.9 years in Alzheimer's disease dementia cases. In contrast, asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals had a 1.1. year younger brain age than controls. Across all cases, the brain-age gap was associated with motor impairment and (in the clinically manifest PD cases) reduced dopamine transporter activity, but less with CSF amyloid-β42 and phosphotau. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases, however, the brain-age gap was associated with lower CSF amyloid-β42 levels. In sporadic and genetic Parkinson's disease cases, a higher brain-age gap was associated with faster decline in episodic memory, and executive and motor function, whereas in asymptomatic LRRK2 cases, a smaller brain-age gap was associated with faster cognitive decline. In conclusion, brain age was sensitive to Alzheimer's disease like rather than Parkinson's disease like brain atrophy. Once an individual had idiopathic Parkinson's disease, their brain age was associated with markers of Alzheimer's disease rather than Parkinson's disease. Asymptomatic LRRK2 cases had seemingly younger brains than controls, and in these cases, younger brain age was associated with poorer cognitive outcome. This suggests that the term brain age is misleading when applied to disease stages where reactive brain changes with apparent volume increases rather than atrophy may drive the calculation of the brain age.",

However, the precise neurophysiological alterations occurring in the pre-clinical stage of human Alzheimer's disease remain controversial. This study aims to provide increased insights on quantitative neurophysiological alterations during a true early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Using high spatial resolution source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography, we investigated regional and whole-brain neurophysiological changes in a unique cohort of 11 cognitively unimpaired individuals with pathogenic mutations in the presenilin-1 or amyloid precursor protein gene and a 1:3 matched control group (n = 33) with a median age of 49 years. We examined several quantitative magnetoencephalography measures that have been shown robust in detecting differences in sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients and are sensitive to excitation-inhibition imbalance. This includes spectral power and functional connectivity in different frequency bands. We also investigated hub vulnerability using the hub disruption index. To understand how magnetoencephalography measures change as the disease progresses through its pre-clinical stage, correlations between magnetoencephalography outcomes and various clinical variables like age were analysed. A comparison of spectral power between mutation carriers and controls revealed oscillatory slowing, characterized by widespread higher theta (4-8 Hz) power, a lower posterior peak frequency and lower occipital alpha 2 (10-13 Hz) power. Functional connectivity analyses presented a lower whole-brain (amplitude-based) functional connectivity in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, predominantly located in parieto-temporal hub regions. Furthermore, we found a significant hub disruption index for (phase-based) functional connectivity in the theta band, attributed to both higher functional connectivity in 'non-hub' regions alongside a hub disruption. Neurophysiological changes did not correlate with indicators of pre-clinical disease progression in mutation carriers after multiple comparisons correction. Our findings provide evidence that oscillatory slowing and functional connectivity differences occur before cognitive impairment in individuals with autosomal dominant mutations leading to early onset Alzheimer's disease. The nature and direction of these alterations are comparable to those observed in the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggest an early excitation-inhibition imbalance, and fit with the activity-dependent functional degeneration hypothesis. These insights may prove useful for early diagnosis and intervention in the future.",

Emerging research suggests that long non-coding RNAs play a role in neural development and function. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between lncRNAs and Alzheimer's disease remains uncertain. The authors' recent discoveries have uncovered an unconventional mechanism involving the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the functioning of the hippocampal fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1)-neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) pathway, which is mediated by cancer susceptibility candidate 15 (CASC15). Subsequently, functional rescue experiments were performed to illustrate the efficient delivery of exosomes harboring a significant amount of 2610307p16Rik transcripts, which is the murine equivalent of human CASC15, to the hippocampal region of mice. This resulted in significant improvements in synaptic morphological plasticity and cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice.

    "ArticleTitle": "Role of Neurotrophins in the Development and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review.",
    "AbstractText": "A considerable amount of morbidity and disability are caused by a wide variety of neurological illnesses together referred to as neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most prevalent and have been thoroughly studied. The development of intervention techniques that focus on the unfavorable elements of these diseases, particularly those that could help halt their course, has become increasingly important. This study aims to explain the most current findings about the function of neurotrophins, the signaling pathways they follow in neurodegenerative illnesses, and their possible therapeutic applications. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 criteria served as the foundation for this systematic review. In April 2024, a thorough search was conducted through the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, and ScienceDirect databases. The predetermined criteria used to choose the research were the English language, narrative and systematic reviews, observational studies, and randomized and non-randomized clinical trials published within the last ten years. Subsequently, each study type-specific quality assessment was conducted utilizing the available assessment method. Of the 3,322 studies found during the first search, 15 were ultimately chosen for inclusion in the final selection. One cohort, one non-randomized clinical trial, one randomized clinical trial, three meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and nine narrative reviews were included. This review has explained in detail the current understanding of how neurotrophins play an essential role in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, as well as their complex downstream signaling that leads to the process of neurodegeneration. Our study has also highlighted previous studies showing the efficacy of neurotrophins in clinical trials, but the data is limited; more preclinical and clinical studies are needed in this regard. These have also drawn our attention to future clinical trials that will address the challenges faced in their delivery and associated complications. Altogether, neurotrophins could serve as promising targets for therapeutic intervention that could stop or even reverse the development of neuropathology associated with neurodegenerative illnesses.",

    "AbstractText": "Recent advancements in arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI have significantly improved our understanding of cerebral perfusion in neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, the focus has been on regional perfusion deficits corresponding to specific neural pathologies. However, this localized approach may overlook the influence of global cerebral blood flow alterations. This manuscript proposes a nuanced perspective that considers the interplay between global and regional changes. By integrating a broader view of cerebral perfusion, we can enhance diagnostic accuracy, uncover new patterns in disease progression, and potentially refine treatment strategies. We advocate for a collaborative effort to validate and implement this comprehensive approach in clinical and research settings.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Protein Citrullination in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
    "AbstractText": "Protein citrullination (PC) is a posttranslational modification (PTM) that converts a peptidyl arginine into a peptidyl citrulline. Aberrant PC is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease, and multiple sclerosis. Common among these diseases is a dramatic increase of PC in reactive astrocytes. Some citrullinated proteins have been identified. The most prominent are astrocytic cytoskeletal proteins such as GFAP and vimentin, and myelin protein MBP. Recent investigation in ALS has revealed new changes, including a decreased PC in neurons and an association of PC with myelin protein aggregates. These findings suggest that PC contributes to protein aggregation, neuronal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and axonal degeneration. However, how PC impact neurodegeneration remains to be understood. Further studies are needed to understand a range of questions, from how PC modulates individual protein functions to its impact on diseases. Because of the PC's robust changes in neurodegenerative diseases, there are also prospects that this PTM may be harnessed as biomarkers, and modulation of this PTM may be an avenue for therapy. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of PC in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, the investigative methods for PC, and PC's potential as a biomarker and a therapeutic target.",

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (ad) is a progressive and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that is associated with cognitive and memory impairment. The main factors which have been implicated in neurodegeneration of ad are oxidative stress and cholinergic neurons dysfunction. Here, we examined the effects of auraptene, a novel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in PC12 cells. METHODS: Thereby, we measured cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, AChE inhibitory activity, cell damage and apoptosis with AlmarBlue, 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), Ellman method, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, propidium iodide (PI) staining and western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: H2O2 (150 μM) resulted in the cell death and apoptosis while, pretreatment with auraptene (10, 20 and 50 μM) significantly increased the viability (P < 0.01), and at 5-50 μM decreased ROS amount (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). Pretreatment with auraptene (10, 20 and 50 μM) lessened AChE activity (P < 0.001), and at 20 and 50 μM reduced the release of LDH (P < 0.001), and at (10, 20 and 50 μM) diminished the percentage of apoptotic cells (P < 0.001). Also, pretreatment with auraptene at 10,20 and 50 μM prevented from poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (P < 0.001), and cytochrome c release (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). The amount of caspase 3 activity (P < 0.001) and survivin (P < 0.001) were elevated after pretreatment of cells with auraptene at 10-50 μM and 10 and 50 μM. CONCLUSION: It seems that auraptene has the ability to slow down or stop H2O2-induced nerve cells death by reducing the activity of AChE and suppression of internal pathway of apoptosis.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder that courses with chronic neuroinflammation. Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an endogenous inhibitor of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ which is upregulated in different neuroinflammatory disorders of diverse origin, including AD. To investigate the role of RPTPβ/ζ in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, we used eight-to ten-month-old APP/PS1 AD mouse model. They were administered intragastrically with MY10, an inhibitor of RPTPβ/ζ, at different doses (60 and 90 mg/kg) every day for 14 days. Treatment with 90 mg/kg MY10 significantly reduced the number and size of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the dorsal subiculum of the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, we observed a significant decrease in the number and size of astrocytes in both sexes and in the number of microglial cells in a sex-dependent manner. This suggests that RPTPβ/ζ plays an important role in modulating Aβ plaque formation and influences glial responses, which may contribute to improved Aβ clearance. In addition, MY10 treatment decreased the interaction of glial cells with Aβ plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the analysis of proinflammatory markers in the hippocampus revealed that MY10 treatment decreased the mRNA levels of Tnfa and Hmgb1. Notably, treatment with MY10 increased Bace1 mRNA expression, which could be involved in enhancing Aβ degradation, and it decreased Mmp9 levels, which might reflect changes in the neuroinflammatory environment and impact Aβ plaque dynamics. These results support the therapeutic potential of inhibition of RPTPβ/ζ in modulating Aβ pathology and neuroinflammation in AD.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) is frequently observed in patients with chronic pain (CP). CP progression increases the risk of dementia and accelerates Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, risk diagnostic models and biomarkers for CP-related CI remain insufficient. Previous research has highlighted the relationships between several complete blood count parameters for CP or CI-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, while the specific values of complete blood count parameters in CP-related CI patients remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the correlation between complete blood count parameters and CP-related CI to establish a risk diagnostic model for the early detection of CP-related CI. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at West China Hospital, Sichuan University. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to classify patients into either the CP with CI group or the CP without CI group. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to screen the related factors of CP-related CI for constructing a risk diagnostic model, and the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The study ultimately included 163 eligible patients. Based on analysis, age (OR, 1.037 [95% CI, 1.007-1.070]; P=0.018), duration of pain (OR, 2.546 [95% CI, 1.099-6.129]; P=0.032), VAS score (OR, 1.724 [95% CI, 0.819-3.672]; P=0.153), LMR (OR, 0.091 [95% CI, 0.024-0.275]; P<0.001), absolute neutrophil value (OR, 0.306 [95% CI, 0.115-0.767]; P=0.014), and lymphocyte percentage (OR, 6.551 [95% CI, 2.143-25.039]; P=0.002) were identified as critical factors of CP-related CI. The diagnostic model was evaluated by the ROC curve, demonstrating good diagnostic value with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.803, a sensitivity of 0.603 and a specificity of 0.871. CONCLUSION: The risk diagnostic model developed in this study for CP-related CI has significant value and enables clinicians to customize interventions based on each patient's needs.",

    "AbstractText": "UNLABELLED: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial to prevent their progression. In this study, we proposed the analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on features including; hippocampus (HC) area size, HC grayscale statistics and texture features (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, entropy), lateral ventricle (LV) area size, gray matter area size, white matter area size, cerebrospinal fluid area size, patient age, weight, and cognitive score. Five machine learning classifiers; K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and multi-layer perception (MLP) were used to distinguish between groups: cognitively normal (CN) vs AD, early MCI (EMCI) vs late MCI (LMCI), CN vs EMCI, CN vs LMCI, AD vs EMCI, and AD vs LMCI. Additionally, the correlation and dependence were calculated to examine the strength and direction of association between each extracted feature and each classification of the group. The average classification accuracies in 20 trials were 95% (SVM), 71.50% (RF), 82.58% (RF), 84.91% (SVM), 85.83% (RF), and 85.08% (RF), respectively, with the best accuracies being 100% (SVM, RF, and MLP), 83.33% (RF), 91.66% (RF), 95% (SVM, and MLP), 96.66% (RF), and 93.33% (DT). Cognitive scores, HC and LV area sizes, and HC texture features demonstrated significant potential for diagnosing AD and its subtypes for all groups. RF and SVM showed better performance in distinguishing between groups. These findings highlight the importance of using 2D-MRI to identify key features containing critical information for early diagnosis of AD.

    "ArticleTitle": "Aβ-mediated synaptic glutamate dynamics and calcium dynamics in astrocytes associated with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "AbstractText": "The accumulation of amyloid β peptide A β  is assumed to be one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease AD  . There is increasing evidence that astrocytes are the primary targets of Aβ. Aβ can cause abnormal synaptic glutamate, aberrant extrasynaptic glutamate, and astrocytic calcium dysregulation through astrocyte glutamate transporters facing the synaptic cleft (GLT-syn), astrocyte glutamate transporters facing the extrasynaptic space (GLT-ess), metabotropic glutamate receptors in astrocytes (mGluR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in astrocytes (NMDAR), and glutamatergic gliotransmitter release (Glio-Rel). However, it is difficult to experimentally identify the extent to which each pathway affects synaptic glutamate, extrasynaptic glutamate, and astrocytic calcium signaling. Motivated by these findings, this work established a concise mathematical model of astrocyte  Ca 2 +   dynamics, including the above Aβ-mediated glutamate-related multiple pathways. The model results presented the extent to which five mechanisms acted upon by Aβ affect synaptic glutamate, extrasynaptic glutamate, and astrocytic intracellular  Ca 2 +   signals. We found that GLT-syn is the main pathway through which Aβ affects synaptic glutamate. GLT-ess and Glio-Rel are the main pathways through which A β affects extrasynaptic glutamate. GLT-syn, mGluR, and NMDAR are the main pathways through which Aβ affects astrocytic intracellular  Ca 2 +   signals. Additionally, we discovered a strong, monotonically increasing relationship between the mean glutamate concentration and the mean  Ca 2 +   oscillation amplitude (or frequency). Our results may have therapeutic implications for slowing cell death induced by the combination of glutamate imbalance and  Ca 2 +   dysregulation in AD.",

We explored electroencephalogram (EEG) criticality in amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment patients with clinical improvement in working memory, verbal memory, verbal fluency and overall executive functions after the completion of a 6-month prospective memory training. We compared \"before\" and \"after\" stationary resting-state EEG records of right-handed MCI patients (n = 17; 11 females), using the method of critical fluctuations and Haar wavelet analysis. Improvement of criticality indices was observed in most electrodes, with mean values being higher after prospective memory training. Significant criticality enhancement was found in the subgroup analysis of frontotemporal electrodes [mean dif: 0.10; Z = 7, p = 0.019]. In the isolated electrode signal analysis, significant post-intervention improvement was noted in pooled criticality indices of electrodes T6 [mean dif: 0.204; t(10) = -2.3, p = 0.044] and F4 [mean dif: 0.0194; t(10) = -2.82; p = 0.018]. EEG criticality agreed with clinical improvement, consisting a possible quantifiable and easy-to-obtain biomarker in MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in patients under cognitive training/rehabilitation. We highlight the role of EEG in prognostication, monitoring and potentially early treatment optimization in MCI or AD patients. Further standardization of the methodology in larger patient cohorts could be valuable for AD theragnostics in patients receiving disease-modifying treatments by providing insights regarding synaptic brain plasticity. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: Critical states' scale-free dynamics optimize neuronal complexity, emerging as biomarkers in cognitive neuroscience. Applying the method of critical fluctuations and Haar wavelet analysis in stationary EEG time-series, we demonstrate criticality enhancement in the frontotemporal electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients after a 6-month prospective memory training, suggesting EEG criticality as a possible monitoring biomarker in MCI and Alzheimer's disease.

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two main types of dementia. These diseases have similar symptoms, and they both may be considered as AD. Early detection of dementia and differential diagnosis between AD and FTD can lead to more effective management of the disease and contributes to the advancement of knowledge and potential treatments. In this approach, several features were extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 36 subjects diagnosed with AD, 23 FTD subjects, and 29 healthy controls (HC). Mann-Whitney U-test and t-test methods were employed for the selection of the best discriminative features. The Fp1 channel for FTD patients exhibited the most significant differences compared to AD. In addition, connectivity features in the delta and alpha subbands indicated promising discrimination among these two groups. Moreover, for dementia diagnosis (AD + FTD vs. HC), central brain regions including Cz and Pz channels proved to be determining for the extracted features. Finally, four machine learning (ML) algorithms were utilized for the classification purpose. For differentiating between AD and FTD, and dementia diagnosis, an accuracy of 87.8% and 93.5% were achieved respectively, using the tenfold cross-validation technique and employing support vector machines (SVM) as the classifier.",

Primary care providers (PCPs) are the first point of contact for patients and their families, and they are critical in understanding the factors associated with disparities in accessing services. This project aims to reflect on the barriers that Latino/a/e/x families experience in accessing and using healthcare services from the perspective of PCPs. METHODS: The data was collected through structured interviews with 23 diverse PCPs across the US via videoconference or phone calls. Participants were recruited via snowball sampling. Two reviewers used an inductive coding approach to conduct qualitative thematic analysis. The Rigorous and Accelerated Data Reduction (RADaR) technique was used to extract relevant data and organize it into relevant categories. RESULTS: Some of the themes identified reflect the experiences of individuals in the diagnostic process and subsequent care: 1) Family members are usually the first ones to notice the symptoms, 2) Delays in seeking care might be partially influenced by denial from individuals and their families, 3) Language congruency promotes the disclosure of symptoms, 4) Care that is linguistically and literacy appropriate requires additional support of patients and families, and 5) Caregiving expectations and preferences by Latino/a/e/x families do not shield caregivers from feeling burnout. Overall, PCPs reflected that the experiences of individuals are highly influenced by socioeconomic factors, which also influence their care plans. CONCLUSION: Most Latino/a/e/x older adults with ADRD will be cared for by a PCP at some point during their disease, which means that they require additional support and resources at primary care appointments to address the barriers to accessing care services and enhance health equity in Latino/a/e/x communities.",

However, fewer studies focused on the potential health impacts of PM 2.5 components, especially for dementia and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). METHODS: We constructed a nationwide population-based open cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older during 2000-2018. This dataset was linked with the predicted levels of 15 PM 2.5 components, including 5 major mass contributors (EC, OC, NH 4 + , NO 3 - , SO 4 2- ) and 10 trace elements (Br, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Ni, Pb, Si, V, Zn) across contiguous US territory. Data were aggregated by ZIP code, calendar year and individual level demographics. Two mixture analysis methods, weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) and quantile g-computation (qgcomp), were used with quasi-Poisson models to analyze the health effects of the total mixture of PM 2.5 components on dementia and AD, as well as the relative contribution of individual components. RESULTS: Exposure to PM 2.5 components over the previous 5 years was significantly associated with increased risks of both dementia and AD, with stronger associations observed for AD. SO 4 2- , OC, Cu were identified with large contributions to the combined positive association of the mixture from both WQS and qgcomp models. CONCLUSION: We found positive associations between the 15 PM 2.5 components and the incidence of dementia and AD.

Although bulk tissue studies have elucidated shared mechanisms of regulatory and disease-associated genetics, the cellular specificity of these mechanisms remains largely unexplored. This study presents a comprehensive single-nucleus multi-ancestry atlas of genetic regulation of gene expression in the human prefrontal cortex, comprising 5.6 million nuclei from 1,384 donors of diverse ancestries. Through multi-resolution analyses spanning eight major cell classes and 27 subclasses, we identify genetic regulation for 14,258 genes, with 857 showing cell type-specific regulatory effects at the class level and 981 at the subclass level. Colocalization of genetic variants associated with gene regulation and disease traits uncovers novel cell type-specific genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders, which were not detectable in bulk tissue analyses. Analysis of dynamic genetic regulation at the single nucleus level identifies 2,073 genes with regulatory effects that vary across developmental trajectories, inferred from a broad age range of donors. We also uncover 1,655 genes with trans-regulatory effects, revealing distal regulation of gene expression.

RESULTS: Network modules revealed hub proteins common to all dementias. Lewy body dementias differed from AD by reduced levels of the autophagy protein p62 (SQSTM1), whereas DLB was distinguished from both AD and PDD by altered TRIM33 and cysteine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) across brain regions. An increase in mitochondrial and synaptic proteins was related to better cognition whereas enrichment in the extracellular matrix, complement system, and autophagy proteins was associated with greater cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: Our study offers valuable insights into the network-based biomarker characterization of molecular signatures of AD, DLB, and PDD.

Functional implications of rs7909468 are relatively unexplored, but in silico analyses indicate it may regulate MGMT expression. rs7909468 was not in linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs found to be significant in this region and appears as a distinct novel association.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two proteinopathies, amyloid and tau, which have a cascading effect on the functional and structural organization of the brain. METHODS: In this study, we used a supervised machine learning technique to build a model of functional connections that predicts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau/Aβ42 (the PATH-fc model). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 289 older adults in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were utilized for this model. RESULTS: We successfully derived the PATH-fc model to predict the ratio of p-tau/Aβ42 as well as cognitive functioning in older adults across the spectrum of healthy and pathological aging. However, the in-sample fit magnitude was low, indicating a need for further model development. DISCUSSION: Our pathology-based model of functional connectivity included representation from multiple canonical networks of the brain with intra-network connectivity associated with low pathology and inter-network connectivity associated with higher levels of pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Whole-brain functional connectivity model (PATH-fc) is linked to AD pathophysiology. The PATH-fc model predicts performance in multiple domains of cognitive functioning. The PATH-fc model is a distributed model including representation from all canonical networks.",

METHODS: We included 3224 participants with information on CVH at early midlife (mean age 45.0 ± standard deviation 3.4) an cognitive assessments, and neuroimaging 5, 10, and 15 years later including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), total gray matter (GM), and hippocampal volume. CVH was operationalized according to the American Heart Association's (AHA) \"Life's Essential 8\" (LE8) guidelines. The association between LE8 and cognitive and neuroimaging measures was examined using mixed linear regression adjusting for age, sex, race, and education. RESULTS: Worse LE8 score was associated with steeper decline in cognition, higher accumulation of WMHs, and steeper decline in total GM and hippocampal volume. DISCUSSION: Poor CVH is related to accelerated brain aging across midlife, highlighting the need to screen for and improve CVH earlier to prevent adverse cognitive outcomes. HIGHLIGHTS: Poor cardiovascular health in early midlife is associated with faster decline in cognition across 10 years overall and in specific domains. Poor and intermediate cardiovascular health was associated with higher accumulation of white matter hyperintensities across midlife. Poor cardiovascular health was associated with faster atrophy in total gray matter volume and hippocampal volume.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: The menopausal decline in ovarian estrogen production is thought to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease; however, this link requires further investigation. The chronological development of this connection is not well defined because of the lack of animal models that recapitulate the time course of menopause. This study characterized the cognitive and neuronal effects of the 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) model of ovarian failure in female mice and assessed whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) would attenuate impairments. METHODS: Female mice were injected with VCD for 15 days. Novel object recognition tests (NORT) were conducted during (perimenopause) and after (menopause) ovarian failure (n = 7). HIIT was initiated in menopause and mice underwent NORT testing after 2 and 8 weeks of HIIT (n = 5). RESULTS: VCD mice had a lower discrimination index, and lower SNAP25 and NeuN expression in perimenopause. HIIT did not recover memory in VCD mice. DISCUSSION: Neuronal changes arise early in the perimenopausal transition and HIIT did not improve recognition memory when initiated in menopause. HIGHLIGHTS: The menopausal decline in ovarian estrogen production increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The chronological development of this connection is not well defined because of the lack of animal models that recapitulate the time course of menopause. 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD)-induced ovarian failure provides a model that simulates the average human experience in the transition from perimenopause to menopause. We demonstrate that cognitive and biochemical effects related to AD pathology are present from the earliest available timepoint in perimenopause in VCD mice. This work highlights the importance of examining the time course in the progression to menopause and the use of VCD as a model to investigate changes in the brain.",

    "AbstractText": "Our review summarizes the diagnostic accuracy of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) in detecting amyloid and tau pathology on positron emission tomography (PET). We systematically reviewed studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of plasma and CSF p-tau217, searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science through August 2024. The accuracy of p-tau217 in predicting amyloid and tau pathology on PET was evaluated in 30 studies. Both plasma and CSF p-tau217 effectively detect amyloid and tau PET deposition. Plasma p-tau217 showed 82% sensitivity for detecting amyloid and 83% for tau, with 86% and 83% specificity, respectively. CSF p-tau217 had 79% sensitivity for amyloid and 91% for tau, with 91% and 84% specificity. p-tau217 effectively identifies Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Plasma p-tau217 was comparable to CSF p-tau217 in detecting amyloid deposition on PET. Despite being less sensitive for detecting tau deposition on PET, plasma p-tau217 can be an efficient screening tool for underlying AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) serves as a viable biomarker alternative to cerebrospinal fluid p-tau217 due to the strong concordance between their results. Plasma p-tau217 accurately identifies amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) positivity, exhibiting a low rate of false negatives and positives, thereby establishing it as a reliable diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma p-tau217 demonstrates slightly higher accuracy in predicting amyloid PET positivity compared to tau PET positivity. Plasma p-tau217 demonstrates higher predictive accuracy in detecting AD pathology among cognitively impaired individuals, compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals, suggesting its enhanced utility as a diagnostic biomarker in clinical settings.",

METHODS: Using Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD) data collected between 2017 and 2023, we examined the association of neighborhood disadvantage with psychosocial distress using demographically adjusted linear regression models, stratified by ethnoracial group and cognitive status. RESULTS: We included 630 non-Hispanic Black, 1109 Hispanic, and 1068 non-Hispanic White older adults deemed cognitively normal (CN) or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Residing in areas of greater neighborhood disadvantage was associated with increased chronic stress (CS) among CN White participants, but this relationship was attenuated among White participants with MCI. Regardless of cognitive status, severe levels of disadvantage were associated with increased CS and depression among Black participants. DISCUSSION: Aging in more disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with greater CS and depression for Black and White participants.

Current analyses sought to contrast the cognitive profiles of EOAD and LOAD. METHODS: Z-score cognitive-domain composites for 311 amyloid-positive sporadic EOAD and 314 amyloid-positive LOAD participants were calculated from baseline data from age-appropriate control cohorts. Z-score composites were compared between AD groups for each domain. RESULTS: After controlling for cognitive status, EOAD displayed worse visuospatial, executive functioning, and processing speed/attention skills relative to LOAD, and LOAD displayed worse language, episodic immediate memory, and episodic delayed memory. DISCUSSION: Sporadic EOAD possesses distinct cognitive profiles relative to LOAD. Clinicians should be alert for non-amnestic impairments in younger patients to ensure proper identification and intervention using disease-modifying treatments. HIGHLIGHTS: Both early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) participants displayed widespread cognitive impairments relative to their same-aged peers.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in a large sample of autopsied participants with AD neuropathological change (ADNC) with and without LB and PART with and without LB, with corresponding ante mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. RESULTS: LB co-pathology worsened cognitive impairment in both PART and ADNC. On longitudinal follow-up, LB impacted cognitive decline in multiple domains. Additionally, LB influenced brain atrophy on MRI across groups and LB regional staging was different in PART and ADNC, accompanying tauopathy progression. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that LB co-pathology is associated with divergent patterns of cognitive impairment, brain atrophy, and regional pathological distribution in PART and AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Lewy body (LB) co-pathology is frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with important clinical implications. LB co-pathology is also present in primary age-related tauopathy (PART), but its significance is still understudied.

    "AbstractText": "\"The eyes are a window to the brain,\" prompting the investigation of whether retinal biomarkers can indicate Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. AD is a neurodegenerative condition with a lengthy preclinical phase where pathologic changes in the central nervous system (CNS) occur before clinical symptoms. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often precedes AD. As part of the CNS, the retina exhibits similar pathologic changes related to AD as those seen in the brains of patients with MCI. Noninvasive imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) allow high-resolution visualization of the retina, providing an opportunity to screen and monitor AD noninvasively. In this review, we summarize the relationship between AD and retinal pathology detected by OCT and OCTA. The most common findings in patients with AD include peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, decreased macular thickness, an enlarged foveal avascular zone, and decreased vascular densities in the superficial and deep capillary plexuses. These retinal changes correlate with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of cerebral atrophy, positron emission tomography (PET) findings of increased amyloid load, and neuropsychological testing results suggesting cognitive dysfunction. We conclude that retinal microstructural and microvascular abnormalities may serve as biomarkers for the early detection and clinical monitoring of AD and as tools for evaluating potential treatment effects.

Elevated ferric ion levels can induce oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory responses, resulting in brain tissue damage and further neurological cell damage. Autophagy in Alzheimer's has a dual role. On one hand, it protects neurons by removing β-amyloid and cellular damage products caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. On the other hand, abnormal autophagy is linked to neuronal apoptosis and neurodegeneration. However, the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and autophagy in AD remains insufficiently explored. This study focuses on the roles of ferroptosis and autophagy in AD and their interconnection through bioinformatics analysis, shedding light on the disease. Ferroptosis and autophagy significantly correlate with the development and course of AD. Using PPI network analysis and unsupervised consistency clustering analysis, we uncovered a complex network of interactions between ferroptosis and autophagy during disease progression, demonstrating a significant congruence in their modification patterns.

The level of β-amyloid plaques in each region was compared among different clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease using the analysis of variance. An additional correlation analysis examined the relationship between each region of interest's cognitive performance scores and asymmetry index values. We found that β-amyloid appears to be lateralized in different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

Existing treatments primarily offer symptomatic relief, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapies that address multiple AD pathways. This study evaluates the efficacy of DK02, a hydroxyl chalcone derivative, in a scopolamine-induced dementia model in zebrafish, hypothesizing that it targets several neurodegenerative mechanisms simultaneously. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We employed a blend of experiments, including in silico docking, in vitro enzyme inhibition assays and in vivo zebrafish models, to assess therapeutic effects of DK02. Methods included molecular docking to forecast interaction sites, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition testing, and various behavioural and histopathological analyses to gauge DK02's cognitive and neuroprotective impacts. KEY RESULTS: DK02 emerged as a potent AChE inhibitor via virtual screening, and significantly enhanced cognitive functions in zebrafish, by improving memory retention and reducing anxiety-like behaviours. DK02 also displayed strong antioxidant properties, reducing oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage. Histopathological analysis confirmed its neuroprotective effects by showing decreased amyloid plaque burden and mitigated structural brain damage. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: DK02 shows promise as a multi-target-directed ligand for AD, offering a new therapeutic path by simultaneously addressing cholinergic, oxidative and amyloid pathways. Its potential to enhance cognitive functions and curtail neurodegeneration suggests advantages over current symptomatic treatments. Further research into DK02 mechanisms and long-term impacts is essential for its development in AD therapy.",

In 2021, the DALYs attributable to smoking, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose in the AD population in China were 602 501.1 (42.3/100 000), 466 728.7 (32.8/100 000), and 1 204 039.4 (84.6/100 000), respectively, with death tolls of 24 897.3 (1.7/100 000), 20 856.3 (1.5/100 000), and 58 838.2 (4.1/100 000). The proportion of DALYs attributable to high BMI showed an upward trend during 1990-2021, while the proportion of DALYs attributable to smoking showed a gradual decrease. The difference in the attributable risk factors between the genders was significant. In 2021, the highest risk among men was attributed to smoking, with DALYs rate and mortality rate of 68.3/100 000 and 2.7/100 000, respectively. In contrast, the highest risk among women was attributed to high fasting blood sugar, with DALYs rate and mortality rate of 111.1/100 000 and 5.6/100 000, respectively. In conclusion,the disease burden of AD is still increasing, and targeted interventions should be taken for both males and females to reduce the burden of AD by reducing unhealthy lifestyles.",

    "AbstractText": "Objective: To investigate the levels of β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in serum of patients with Alzheimer 's disease (AD) and the relationship between them. Methods: A case-control study was conducted to select 73 patients with AD who were hospitalized in Beijing Huilongguan Hospital from November 2023 to February 2024 as AD group, and 70 healthy controls (HC) were selected as HC group. The basic information of all subjects and the clinical information of AD patients were collected, and the levels of Aβ1-42 and TBIL were detected and compared between the two groups. The effects of Aβ1-42 and TBIL on AD were analyzed by binary logistic regression. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between TBIL and Aβ1-42 in AD group and HC group. According to the level of Aβ1-42 in AD patients, they were divided into Aβ1-42 elevated group and Aβ1-42 normal group. The differences of clinical data and TBIL levels between the two groups were compared. According to the quartile of TBIL in AD patients, they were divided into Q1 group, Q2 group, Q3 group and Q4 group. The correlation between TBIL and the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation was analyzed by binary logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to analyze the ability of TBIL level to predict the increase of Aβ1-42 in AD patients. Results: There was no significant difference in gender, marital status, education level, smoking and drinking between AD group and HC group (P>0.05), while the levels of Aβ1-42 and TBIL and age in AD group were significantly higher than those in HC group [101.10(71.20, 128.60) pg/ml/22.40(10.00, 39.60) pg/ml, Z=-8.714, P<0.001;(11.00±3.22/8.07±3.00) μmol/L, t=5.621, P<0.001;(77.14±8.20/68.30±10.27) years, t=5.672, P<0.001]. For AD patients, the TBIL level in the Aβ1-42 elevated group was lower than that in the Aβ1-42 normal group [(10.05±2.94/11.66±3.28) μmol/L, t=-2.148, P=0.035], while there was no significant difference in other demographic and clinical data between the two groups (P>0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that higher levels of Aβ1-42 (OR=1.021, 95%CI：1.010-1.032) and TBIL (OR=1.505, 95%CI：1.249-1.814), older age (OR=1.083, 95%CI：1.020-1.150) and female (OR=4.348, 95%CI：1.253-15.094) were risk factors for AD. Correlation analysis showed that TBIL was negatively correlated with Aβ1-42 in AD patients (r=-0.322, P=0.006). After adjusting the relevant covariates, binary logistic regression showed that compared with AD patients in Q1 group, the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation in AD patients in Q4 group was lower (OR=0.052, 95%CI：0.005-0.535, P<0.05), and TBIL was negatively correlated with the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation (P trend<0.05). ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of TBIL in predicting the increase of Aβ1-42 in AD patients was 0.642. Conclusion: The levels of Aβ1-42 and TBIL in AD patients were higher, and the level of TBIL was negatively correlated with the risk of Aβ1-42 elevation.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairments. Despite extensive research, its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, and effective treatments are limited. This study explored the therapeutic potential of agarwood in AD by integrating network pharmacology, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and single-cell expression analysis. The results revealed that agarwood compounds may modulate key inflammatory genes such as NFKB1, STAT1, and TLR4, alleviating neuroinflammation; enhance the expression of HSP90 and regulate KDR signaling to improve blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity; and promote the activity of PTPN11 and CXCR4 to support oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) repair and remyelination. Single-cell expression analysis highlighted cell-type-specific expression patterns, particularly in OPCs and endothelial cells, underscoring their relevance in AD pathology. Agarwood's multi-dimensional therapeutic potential positions it as a promising candidate for the development of novel AD treatments.",

It is the second most common type of cognitive impairment after Alzheimer's disease. The pathogenesis of VCI is complex, and neurovascular unit destruction is one of its important mechanisms. The neurovascular unit (NVU) is responsible for combining blood flow with brain activity and includes endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and many regulatory nerve terminals. The concept of an NVU emphasizes that interactions between different types of cells are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. A stable NVU is the basis of normal brain function. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the neurovascular unit and its role in VCI development is crucial for gaining insights into its pathogenesis. This article reviews the structure and function of the neurovascular unit and its contribution to VCI, providing valuable information for early diagnosis and prevention.",

Utilizing the APP/PS1 mouse model combined with CCH, we assessed cognitive function, Aβ deposition, and the expression levels of relevant proteins through behavioral tests and immunohistochemical analysis. Our findings revealed pronounced cognitive deficits and increased Aβ deposition in the AD + CCH group mice, along with upregulation of mitochondrial fission proteins (Drp1, Fis1) and downregulation of mitochondrial fusion proteins (Opa1, Mfn1), indicating a shift towards mitochondrial fission and promoting cell apoptosis. Additionally, alterations were observed in the expression levels of cellular autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II, P62), which were reversed by treatment with autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Furthermore, the expression of mitochondrial autophagy-related proteins PINK1 and Parkin was affected, with 3-MA alleviating this effect. In summary, our study elucidates the complex interplay among cognitive decline, increased Aβ deposition, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the AD + CCH model, and suggests that modulating autophagy could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating the AD + CCH model.",

Despite evidence of sex-specific differences in aging and cognition, the impact of age on female rodent behaviour is underexplored. This study investigated age-related behavioural changes in female C57BL/6 mice over 8 months, alongside neurochemical markers amyloid, Tau, and T14, a novel peptide from acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that promotes cell growth/renewal. Behavioural assessments showed an age-dependent decline in nest-building ability and familiar odour discrimination from 10 months. Spatial learning declined at 10 and 13 months, while object recognition memory remained intact from 5 to 13 months of age. Neurochemical analyses revealed a decline in T14 and its receptor α7-AChR during postnatal development and adulthood. However, there was a disparity between AChE expression and its enzymatic activity. T14 levels correlated with phosphorylated tau, but not amyloid, and negatively with nest-building scores, suggesting a role of T14 in age-related behavioural changes. This study highlights early behavioural and molecular indicators of cognitive decline in middle-aged female mice.",

However, the precise types of interferons and related cytokines, both from the brain and periphery, responsible for cognitive impairment in patients with AD remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 131 participants (78 [59.5%] female and 53 [40.5%] male; mean [SD] age, 61.5 [7.6] years) with normal cognition and cognitive impairment from the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Initiative cohort were included. CSF and serum IFNα-2a, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1and CXCL-10 were tested. The correlation between these interferons and related cytokines with AD core biomarkers in the CSF and plasma, cognition performance, and brain MRI measures were analysed. RESULTS: We found that only CSF IFN-β levels were significantly elevated in Alzheimer's disease compared to normal cognition. Furthermore, CSF IFN-β levels were significantly associated with AD core biomarkers (CSF P-tau and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio) and cognitive performance (MMSE and CDR score). Additionally, the CSF IFN-β levels were significantly correlated with the typical pattern of brain atrophy in AD (such as hippocampus, amygdala, and precuneus). In contrast, CSF IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in non-AD cognitively impaired patients compared to other groups. Moreover, CSF IL-6 levels were significantly associated with cognitive performance in non-AD individuals and correlated with the vascular cognitive impairment-related MRI markers (such as white matter hyperintensity). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that distinct inflammatory molecules are associated with different cognitive disorders. Notably, CSF IFN-β levels are significantly linked to the pathology and cognitive performance of AD, identifying this interferon as a potential target for AD therapy.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Do Caregivers Value the New Antiamyloid Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease More Than Home-Based Care?",
    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: The new antiamyloid medications Lecanemab (Leqembi) and donanemab (Kisunla) are the first disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to receive full FDA approval. However, some commentators question whether the drugs' benefits outweigh their risks, burdens, and costs to patients. This study assessed the perceived value of these medications by asking caregivers of persons with AD to compare them to a widely used intervention in AD management: home-based care. DESIGN: Online survey (March 27th-April 17th, 2024) of 392 AD caregivers recruited via CloudResearch Prime Panels to match the U.S. public in education, household income, race, and ethnicity. The survey used vignettes describing antiamyloid medication and 25 hours/week of home-based care (estimated to be of similar monetary value). After rating the desirability of medication and home-based care, respondents indicated their preference for which intervention they wanted their loved one's insurance to cover. RESULTS: Respondents expressed a desire for their loved ones to receive both the medication and home-based care. Over half (56.9%) favored home-based care coverage. Those preferring medication coverage were more likely to believe its benefits outweigh its risks and burdens. Preference for medication coverage was also associated with being male, Hispanic, less educated, and correctly answering fewer comprehension questions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show most caregivers perceive modest clinical value in the novel antiamyloid therapies, and the decision to use these drugs will be preference-sensitive, pointing to the need for thorough informed consent discussions.",

    "AbstractText": "Soluble cytotoxic oligomers produced during the fibrillation of both α-synuclein (αS) and amyloid-β protein (Aβ) are key pathogenic factors in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing toxic oligomers by regulating the aggregation process of αS and Aβ is an important strategy for the treatment of PD and AD. Herein, tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) is found to accelerate amyloid fibrillization, decreases cytotoxic oligomers and suppresses their toxicity. Thioflavin T and atomic force microscopy assays results showed that THF was able to accelerate the formation of dense fibrils from αS and Aβ in a dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, this was accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of toxic oligomers, and these results were confirmed by DB. Meanwhile, MTT and FDA/PI assays demonstrated that THF-induced accelerated fibril formation was accompanied by a reduction in αS- and Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, the lifespan of genetically modified αS and Aβ expressing C. elegans was extended by feeding THF, although plaque deposits of αS and Aβ increased. These findings suggest that THF enhances the conversion of αS and Aβ oligomers into less toxic fibrils and is a potential therapeutic agent for PD and AD.",

In CR studies, neuropsychological performances and functional autonomy are considered alternative outcomes. While decreased functional independence gains importance in dementia diagnosis and monitoring, cognitive functioning may play a role in staging its severity. The main aim of the present study was to test a longitudinal model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), in which CR (years of education) and current cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE, score) would predict clinical progression in terms of loss of functional independence at a later time. From the ADNI database, we considered 308 AD participants, and for 180 of them, we could extract CSF Aβ1-42 baseline levels as an index of amyloid burden. Functional decline (one-year delta score at the Functional Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire) was explained by the CR and MMSE score interaction net of age; a trend was found also when controlling for amyloid burden. Functional decline at one year was increased for patients with high CR levels and low MMSE and with low CR and high cognitive state, compared to the opposite. The present investigation demonstrated the mutual role of past acquired CR and current cognitive status in predicting functional progression in AD. The study suggests a way to predictively interpret available demographic and clinical data, defining differential longitudinal trajectories that might be useful for clinical management.",

METHODS: Twenty-five AD patients and 25 matched elderly healthy controls were tested with a validated FPVS-EEG paradigm in which different written words of the same semantic category (cities) appear at a fixed frequency of 4 words per second (4 Hz) for 70 seconds. Words from a different semantic category (animal) appear every 4 stimuli (i.e., 1 Hz). RESULTS: Frequency domain EEG analysis showed a robust response objectively identified at specific 1 Hz harmonics over the left occipito-temporal cortex for healthy controls, indexing automatic semantic categorization. However, only a negligible response, less than 25 % of healthy controls', was found in AD patients, this response being inversely correlated with the amount of Tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. The significant group difference was maximal when including an additional left central region, with only 2.5 min of testing providing a significant group difference.

In comparison of most other fluorescent probes, Cu3I (SR)2 presented exceptional stability against pH, temperature, UV irradiation, redox agents, and metal ions, as well as good recyclability due to its unique chemical structure. We further found the fluorescence emission of Cu3I (SR)2 could be quenched by MnO2 nanosheet (NS) via inner filter effect, and restored by thiocholine (TCh) generated from the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCh) in the catalysis of AChE. On this basis, a fluorescence \"turn-on\" assay was developed for monitoring AChE activity with a detection limit of 0.03 U/L and a detection range of 0.25-50 U/L. This method demonstrates great potential for real-time detection of AChE activity in biological samples and screening of AChE inhibitors obtained from herbal extracts as anti-AD agents.

METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Rhineland Study (N = 5812, 55.2 ± 13.6 years, 58% women) and the UK Biobank Imaging Study (UKB) (N = 45,076, 64.2 ± 7.7 years, 53% women), two large-scale population-based cohort studies. Volumes of hypothalamic structures were obtained from 3T structural magnetic resonance images through an automatic parcellation procedure (FastSurfer-HypVINN). The standardised cognitive domain scores were derived from extensive neuropsychological test batteries. We employed multivariable linear regression to assess associations of hypothalamic volumes with age, sex and cognitive performance. FINDINGS: In older individuals, volumes of total, anterior and posterior hypothalamus, and mammillary bodies were smaller, while those of medial hypothalamus and tuberal region were larger. Larger medial hypothalamus volume was related to higher cortisol levels in older individuals, providing functional validation. Volumes of all hypothalamic structures were larger in men compared to women. In both sexes, larger volumes of total, anterior and posterior hypothalamus, and mammillary bodies were associated with better domain-specific cognitive performance, whereas larger volumes of medial hypothalamus and tuberal region were associated with worse domain-specific cognitive performance. INTERPRETATION: We found strong age and sex effects on hypothalamic structures, as well as robust associations between these structures and domain-specific cognitive functions. Overall, these findings thus implicate specific hypothalamic subregions as potential therapeutic targets against age-associated cognitive decline.

Herein, the current study investigated the possible modulatory effects of memantine/ rosuvastatin therapy on TGF-β1/p-Smad/p21 signaling pathway and their correlation to the blood brain barrier transporters involved in Aβ-clearance and microRNAs as a novel molecular mechanism in AD treatment. AD was induced by a single intracerebroventricular streptozotocin injection (ICV-STZ, 3 mg/kg) in rats and drug therapy was continued for 28 days after AD induction. Efficacy was monitored by applying a battery of behavioral assessments, as well as biochemical, histopathological, molecular and gene expression techniques. The upregulated TGF-β1-signaling in the untreated rats was found to be highly correlated to transporters and microRNAs governing Aβ-efflux; ABCA1/miRNA-26 and LRP1/miRNA-205 expressions, rather than RAGE/miRNA-185 controlling Aβ-influx; an effect that was opposed by the tested drugs and was found to be correlated with the abolished TGF-β1-signaling as well. Combined memantine/rosuvastatin therapy ameliorated the STZ evoked decreases in escape latency and number of crossovers in the Morris water maze test, % spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test, and discrimination and recognition indices in the object recognition test. The evoked behavioral responses were directly related to the β-amyloid accumulation and the alteration in its clearance. Additionally, drug treatment increased brain glutathione and decreased malondialdehyde levels. These findings were histopathologically confirmed by a marked reduction of gliosis and restoration of neuronal integrity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the AD rats. These findings implicated that the memantine/rosuvastatin combination could offer a new therapeutic potential for AD management by abrogating the TGF-β1/p-Smad2/p21 pathway and regulating Aβ-clearance.",

Our study aimed to determine risk profiles for neurocognitive decline and ADRDs in early-stage MetS with evidence of CSVD using the TriNetX electronic health records (EHR) research network. Patients aged 50 to 80 years old meeting MetS criteria were identified utilizing TriNetX data from 76 healthcare organizations. Propensity score matching controlled for demographic and confounding factors. Cohorts included MetS-only, non-MetS, and a MetS subset with evidence of CSVD (MetS-CSVD) created by clustering relevant ICD-codes for diagnoses, imaging, and lab work. Contingency analyses determined odds of developing neurocognitive decline, ADRDs, and CSVD in MetS vs non-MetS and MetS-CSVD vs. MetS-only, using odd ratios with 95% confidence intervals (p-value < 0.05). After propensity score matching, there were 57,347 men and 52,259 women in each of the MetS and non-MetS cohorts and 2,810 men and 2,862 women in each of the MetS-CSVD and MetS-only cohorts.

Compared to MetS-only, the MetS-CSVD showed elevated odds in developing neurocognitive decline (men: RR = 1.81, p = 0.040; women: RR = 1.87, p = 0.018) and ADRDs (men: RR = 2.39, p = 0.009; women: RR = 1.65, p = 0.041). A large, predominantly US, sample of subclinical MetS demonstrated heightened odds for developing neurocognitive decline and ADRDs, with even higher odds when evidence of CSVD was also present. TriNetX facilitated a robust exploration of these associations, and our findings warrant further investigation of interventions that target this subclinical at-risk population.",

    "AbstractText": "Predicting amyloid status is crucial in light of upcoming disease-modifying therapies and the need to identify treatment-eligible patients with Alzheimer's disease. In our study, we aimed to predict CSF-amyloid status and eligibility for anti-amyloid treatment in a memory clinic by (I) comparing the performance of visual/automated rating scales and MRI volumetric analysis and (II) combining MRI volumetric data with neuropsychological tests and APOE4 status. Two hundred ninety patients underwent a comprehensive assessment. The cNeuro cMRI software (Combinostics Oy) provided automated computed rating scales and volumetric analysis. Amyloid status was determined using data-driven CSF biomarker cutoffs (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), and eligibility for anti-Aβ treatment was assessed according to recent recommendations published after the FDA approval of the anti-Aβ drug aducanumab. The automated rating scales and volumetric analysis demonstrated higher performance compared to visual assessment in predicting Aβ status, especially for parietal-GCA (AUC = 0.70), MTA (AUC = 0.66) scores, hippocampal (AUC = 0.68), and angular gyrus (AUC = 0.69) volumes, despite low global accuracy. When we combined hippocampal and angular gyrus volumes with RAVLT immediate recall and APOE4 status, we achieved the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.82), which remained high even in predicting anti-Aβ treatment eligibility (AUC = 0.81). Our study suggests that automated analysis of atrophy rating scales and brain volumetry outperforms operator-dependent visual rating scales. When combined with neuropsychological and genetic information, this computerized approach may play a crucial role not only in a research context but also in a real-world memory clinic. This integration results in a high level of accuracy for predicting amyloid-CSF status and anti-Aβ treatment eligibility.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Opposite Roles of Cholesterol and Lanosterol in Lipid Membrane on Amyloid-Beta 42 Peptide Nucleation and Fibril Formation.",
    "AbstractText": "Molecular self-assembly of amyloid-beta peptides to form fibrillar aggregates is a known cause of Alzheimer's disease. Although homogeneous nucleation of amyloid-beta is unfavorable, heterogeneous nucleation of amyloid-beta in cell membranes plays a key role in fibril formation. We observed these opposite roles in the effects of cholesterol and lanosterol, the precursor of cholesterol in the brain, on nucleation. As previously reported, cholesterol accelerated nucleation, whereas lanosterol decelerated it when mixed with dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine at 20%. The observed opposite effects of cholesterol and lanosterol on nucleation do not correlate with the differences in the mechanical and thermodynamic nature of mixed membranes. However, the affinity of amyloid-beta to the inner membrane seems to be related to the opposite effects on nucleation kinetics. Cholesterol reduced the insertion of amyloid-beta into the lipid membrane, whereas lanosterol promoted the insertion of amyloid-beta into the membrane, which would make amyloid-beta more tightly bound by lipid molecules and reduce its diffusivity in the membrane and consequently inhibit nucleation. Our study provides insights into the effects of sterol compounds other than the well-investigated cholesterol on the self-assembly of amyloid-beta to clarify the molecular basis underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology and to develop targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Accumulation of critically short telomeres (CST) is implicated in decreased tissular regenerative capacity and increased susceptibility to degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Telomere shortening has also been associated with age-related brain changes. However, it remains unclear whether CST accumulation is directly associated with AD markers or instead amplifies age-related effects, potentially increasing susceptibility of developing AD in cognitively healthy older adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data of 129 community-dwelling cognitively healthy older adults from the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819), aged 65 years and older enrolled between 2016 and 2018, in France. Using linear regressions, we analyzed the relationship between an innovative marker of telomere shortening, the percentage of CST (%CST), structural, functional and molecular neuroimaging outcomes, and multiple blood-based biomarkers related to AD pathophysiology. The effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype (APOE4) was assessed on these relationships using interaction analysis. RESULTS: A higher %CST was associated with lower global kurtosis fractional anisotropy (β = -.230; P = .010), particularly in frontal and temporal regions. A higher %CST was also related to higher plasma levels of Neurofilament light chain (β = .195; P = .020) and a lower subiculum volume (β = -.206; P = .020), although these associations did not meet the threshold for multiple comparisons. %CST was not associated with AD-related neuroimaging markers, including the AD-sensitive gray matter pattern (β = -.060; P = .441), glucose metabolism pattern (β = -.099; P = .372), brain perfusion pattern (β = -.106; P = .694) or hippocampus volume (β = -.106; P = .194). In APOE4 carriers, higher %CST was associated with lower subiculum (β = -.423; P = 0.003), DG (β = -.410; P = 0.018) and CA1 volumes (β = -.373; P = 0.024), even though associations with DG and CA1 volumes did not survive multiple comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Although an increase in %CST does not appear to be directly linked to the pathophysiology of AD in cognitively healthy older adults, it could heighten the susceptibility of APOE4 carriers to develop AD plausibly due to greater vulnerability to age-related effects. However, longitudinal studies would be necessary to determine whether %CST influences the development and progression of AD later in life.",

    "ArticleTitle": "pTau pathology in the retina of TAU58 mice: association with ganglion cell degeneration and implications on seeding and propagation of pTau from human brain lysates.",
    "AbstractText": "The accumulation of abnormal phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau) in neurons of the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PTau pathology also occurs in the retina of AD cases. Accordingly, questions arise whether retinal pTau can act as a potential seed for inducing cerebral pTau pathology and whether retinal pTau pathology causes degeneration of retinal neurons. To address these questions, we (1) characterized pTau pathology in the retina of TAU58 mice, (2) determined the impact of pTau pathology on retinal ganglion cell density, and (3) used this mouse model to test whether brain lysates from AD and/or non-AD control cases induce seeding in the retina and/or propagation into the brain. TAU58 mice developed retinal pTau pathology at 6 months of age, increasing in severity and extent with age. TAU58 mice showed reduced retinal ganglion cell density compared to wild-type mice, which declined with age and pTau pathology progression. Brain lysates from non-AD Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage I controls increased retinal pTau pathology after subretinal injection compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) but did not accelerate pTau pathology in the brain. In contrast, subretinally injected AD brain lysates accelerated pTau pathology in the retina and the contralateral superior colliculus. Subretinal injection of AD brain lysates, but not of non-AD brain, induced in this context a neuroinflammatory response in the retina and in the contralateral primary visual cortex. These results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Brain lysates from AD and non-AD sources can accelerate tauopathy within the retina. (2) The anterograde propagation of pTau pathology from the retina to the brain can be triggered by subretinal injections of AD brain lysates. (3) Such subretinal injections also provoke a neuroinflammatory response in both the retina and the visual cortex. (4) The accumulation of retinal pTau is associated with the degeneration of the involved ganglion cells, indicating that retinal tauopathy might contribute to vision impairment in the elderly and underscore the retina's potential role in spreading tau pathology to the brain.",

    "AbstractText": "The combination of amyloid beta and tau pathologies leads to tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. However, the relative contributions of amyloid beta and tau peptide accumulation to the manifestation of the pathological phenotype in the early stages, before the overt deposition of plaques and tangles, are still unclear. We investigated the longitudinal pathological effects of combining human-like amyloidosis and tauopathy in a novel transgenic rat model, coded McGill-R-APPxhTau. We compared the effects of individual and combined amyloidosis and tauopathy in transgenic rats by assessing the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's-like amyloid and tau pathologies using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Extensive behavioral testing for learning and memory was also conducted to evaluate cognitive decline. Additionally, we investigated brain inflammation, neuronal cell loss, as well as synaptic plasticity through acute brain slice electrophysiological recordings and Western blotting. Evaluation of Alzheimer's-like amyloidosis and tauopathy, at the initial stages, unexpectedly revealed that the combination of amyloid pathology with the initial increment in phosphorylated tau exerted a paradoxical corrective effect on amyloid-induced cognitive impairments and led to a compensatory-like restoration of synaptic plasticity as revealed by electrophysiological evidence, compared to monogenic transgenic rats with amyloidosis or tauopathy. We discovered elevated CREB phosphorylation and increased expression of postsynaptic proteins as a tentative explanation for the improved hippocampal synaptic plasticity. However, this tau-induced protective effect on synaptic function was transient. As anticipated, at more advanced stages, the APPxhTau bigenic rats exhibited aggravated tau and amyloid pathologies, cognitive decline, increased neuroinflammation, and tau-driven neuronal loss compared to monogenic rat models of Alzheimer's-like amyloid and tau pathologies. The present findings propose that the early accumulation of phosphorylated tau may have a transient protective impact on the evolving amyloid pathology-derived synaptic impairments.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and Lewy pathology (LP) often coexist in cognitively impaired individuals. These pathologies' relative distribution and severity may modify these individuals' clinical presentation, cognitive profile, and prognosis. Therefore, we examined the contributions of LP and concomitant ADNC to disease survival and profiles of cognitive decline in preclinical and clinical stages in a large neuropathologically diagnosed group. METHODS: We evaluated 597 participants with LP and 491 participants with intermediate/high ADNC in the absence of LP from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) database. At baseline, 237 participants were cognitively normal (CN), 255 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 596 with dementia. Cognition was assessed using three cognitive domain scores (i.e., Memory, Executive, and Language) from the NACC Uniform Dataset (UDS) neuropsychological test battery, MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Multivariate adaptive regression splines were used to evaluate associations between baseline cognitive scores and mean annual rate of change over two years. The likelihood of progression to MCI or dementia was assessed using Cox hazard models. RESULTS: Neocortical LP, independent of the clinical diagnosis, was associated with lower Executive and higher Language and Memory scores at baseline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with lower Memory and Language scores. Similarly, neocortical LP was associated with faster Executive decline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with faster Memory and Language decline. A clinical diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (i.e., a strong LP phenotype) was associated with the LP cognitive profile and shorter disease duration. Progression to incident MCI or dementia was primarily associated with the degree of tau pathology; neocortical LP or a diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia only predicted progression when those with intermediate/high ADNC were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: LP and ADNC differentially affected cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive profiles in a large autopsy sample. Concomitant Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology had a strong impact on clinical progression in those with LP, regardless of the initial stage. Thus, LB and ADNC co-pathology interact to affect cognitive domains that may be used to track Lewy Body disease longitudinally and as outcome measures in therapeutic trials.",

CR1 is an important participant in the erythrocyte immune machinery and plays an major role in inhibiting complement activation, and polymorphisms in its expression have been closely associated with a variety of diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malaria, Plasmodium falciparum malaria, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and leprosy. Antibodies to the Knops system usually do not bind to complement and do not cause a hemolytic reaction. However, anti-Knops antibodies can be detected in the serum of some pregnant women.

    "AbstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Brain atrophy measured by structural imaging has been used to quantify resilience against neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Considering glucose hypometabolism is another marker of neurodegeneration, we quantified metabolic resilience (MR) based on Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and investigated its clinical implications. METHODS: We quantified the MR and other resilience metrics, including brain resilience (BR) and cognitive resilience (CR), using partial least squares path modeling from the ADNI database. A linear mixed-effects model and a Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify the impact of each resilience on longitudinal cognitive function and conversion to dementia, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 848 participants were included in this study. All resilience metrics (CR, BR, and MR) were associated with slower cognitive decline. Results from the ANOVA test, AIC and BIC values showed that the additional inclusion of MR improved the performances of the linear mixed effect models. In survival analysis, all resilience variables were negatively associated with the risk of conversion to dementia. In line with the results of the linear mixed effects models, the additional inclusion of MR into the models with different resilience variables increased the C-index. CONCLUSION: Relative preservation of brain glucose metabolism is a valuable predictor of future cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, adding value to existing resilience metrics. While the utility of FDG PET in clinical settings is limited by cost and accessibility, it might have potential usefulness as a prognostic marker, especially in a context of resilience.",

    "AbstractText": "Missense mutations in the EPHA1 receptor tyrosine kinase have been identified in Alzheimer's patients. To gain insight into their potential role in disease pathogenesis, we investigated the effects of four of these mutations. We show that the P460L mutation in the second fibronectin type III (FN2) domain drastically reduces EPHA1 cell surface localization while increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of the cell surface-localized receptor. The R791H mutation in the kinase domain abolishes EPHA1 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating abrogation of kinase-dependent signaling. Furthermore, both mutations decrease EPHA1 phosphorylation on S906 in the kinase-SAM linker region, suggesting impairment of a noncanonical form of signaling regulated by serine/threonine kinases. The R492Q mutation, also in the FN2 domain, has milder effects than the P460L mutation while the R926C mutation in the SAM domain increases S906 phosphorylation. We also found that EPHA1 undergoes constitutive proteolytic cleavage in the FN2 domain, generating a soluble 55 kDa N-terminal fragment containing the ligand-binding domain and a transmembrane 60 kDa C-terminal fragment. The 60 kDa WT fragment is phosphorylated on both tyrosine residues and S906, suggesting signaling functions. The P460L mutant 60 kDa fragment undergoes proteasomal degradation and the R791H mutant fragment lacks tyrosine phosphorylation and has decreased S906 phosphorylation. These findings advance our understanding of EPHA1 signaling mechanisms and support the notion that alterations in EPHA1 signaling due to missense mutations contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",

However, progress against mortality across counties with different socioeconomic profiles has not been well described. The objective of this study was to examine changes in death rates from leading causes of death by county poverty level in the contiguous US. METHODS: Using county-level death (all causes, 10 leading causes in 2020, excluding COVID-19) and population data derived from the National Center for Health Statistics, we calculated absolute and relative changes in age-standardized death rates by county poverty level from 1990-1994 to 2016-2020. FINDINGS: From 1990-1994 to 2016-2020, death rates from all causes, diseases of the heart, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and pneumonia/influenza declined nationally, but rates increased for unintentional injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, suicide/self-inflicted injury, and kidney disease mortality. Counties with higher poverty levels (≥20%) had smaller declines or larger increases in death rates for each evaluated cause of death, exacerbating the disparities in mortality by county poverty level, except for unintentional injury and suicide/self-inflicted injury. Consequently, in 2016-2020, the death rates for leading causes of death were 12% (for Alzheimer's disease; suicide/self-inflicted injury) to 81% (for diabetes) higher in people residing in counties with the highest poverty level than in those residing in counties with the lowest poverty level. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in mortality from most leading causes of death by county poverty level widened during the past three decades. FUNDING: There was no external funding for this study.",

It is very challenge to develop near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe methods for highly selective and sensitive detection of BChE in vivo. Based on the differences in active sites and spatial pockets between acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and BChE, a new NIR BChE-responsive fluorescence probe Probe-BChE (λex/λem = 600 nm/676 nm) was designed and synthesized by introducing dimethyl carbamate group as recognizing moiety to a NIR fluorophore hemicyanine skeleton. It was found that Probe-BChE specifically binds with BChE, rather than AChE, since BChE has a big cavity and strong intermolecular forces with Probe-BChE, which was supported by the molecular docking scores. The fluorescence method for the determination of BChE was developed with a detection limit of 0.14 U/mL BChE and high selectivity as well as short reaction time (∼3 s). The fluorescence imaging method using Probe-BChE efficiently image the levels of endogenous BChE in brains and main organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. The results reveal that the levels of endogenous BChE in old AD mice is higher than that in young AD mice, and endogenous BChE is enriched in the liver of AD mice. This work demonstrates that Probe-BChE is a promising fluorescence probe for imaging of endogenous BChE in AD mice. The design of NIR fluorescence probes for endogenous BChE in this work will promote to design NIR fluorescence probes for endogenous cholinesterase.",

The current paper examined PE across one week in a sample of patients with PD via traditional methods and regression-based change scores, as well as if these change scores relate to clinical variables in PD. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with PD were administered a brief cognitive battery twice across approximately one week. Using both simple-difference and standardized regression-based change scores, a series of one-sample and independent t-tests were calculated to assess for PE across the test battery. Pearson correlations examined both types of change scores and measures of mood and severity of motor symptoms. RESULTS: Whereas traditional analyses (i.e., simple difference scores and dependent t-tests) did not reveal any changes on test scores over this interval, regression-based change scores did identify that these individuals showed significantly smaller-than-expected PE on three of the seven cognitive scores. Furthermore, when these regression-based change scores were trichotomized (decline/stable/improve), four of the seven tests showed significantly more decline than expected in this sample. Finally, these regression-based change scores significantly correlated with motor measures, with smaller PE being associated with worse motor functioning. CONCLUSION: Although these results are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger and more diverse samples, smaller-than-expected PE are seen in PD and they may signal more advanced disease.",

The complex network of triggering factors involved in the insurgence and progression of AD can be rightly addressed as one of the main reasons behind the difficulty in identifying new pharmacological approaches. For this reason, the discovery and development of drugs endowed with pleiotropic activity remain the most valuable, but at the same time challenging, approaches to tackle down AD. Interestingly, the combination of active pharmacophores through molecular hybridization - or Multi-Target Directed Ligand strategy (MTDL) - has not been explored enough for this disease, despite proving to be a successfully strategy in other field, such as oncology. To contribute to the development of new strategies against AD, we decided to explore the hybridization of the marketed drug rivastigmine - prescribed to ameliorate AD symptomatology - with moieties capable to release hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter with a key role in the neurological physiology of ageing. In particular, we identified compound 1, as a potent small molecule capable of inhibit AChE, preventing inflammation and ROS production in cultured neurons and microglia, triggering autophagy response and blocking Aβ fibrils propagation. Interestingly, the beneficial effects observed in vitro have been confirmed in vivo, since the rivastigmine derivative 1 improved the lifespan in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of AD.",

    "AbstractText": "Neurodegeneration refers to the gradual loss of neurons and extensive changes in glial cells like tau inclusions in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, α-synuclein inclusions in oligodendrocytes and SOD1 aggregates in astrocytes along with deterioration in the motor, cognition, learning, and behavior. Common neurodegenerative disorders are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and supranuclear palsy. There is a lack of effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and scientists are putting their efforts into developing therapies against them. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a hope for neurodegenerative disorders since it is not only the damaged neurons that might be replaced, but other neuromodulators and neuroprotectors are secreted. Stem cell terminal differentiation before implantation ensures the implantation of correct cells and molecular markers like carbonic anhydrase II, CNPase (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase), myelin basic protein (MBP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) elucidate the differentiation. Secretion of various growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor-α (VEGF-α), transforming growth factor (TGF), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) supports cell survival, cell proliferation, blood vessel formation, axon regeneration, and neuroglial functional connection formation at the site of degeneration. Adverse effects of stem cell therapy, like teratogenicity and differentiation in different cells other than the desired one under the influence of microenvironment, are a few key concerns. Post-transplantation improved synaptic plasticity, apoptosis inhibition, and reduction in tau-phosphorylation and amyloid beta (Aβ) production has been observed in Alzheimer's patients. A large number of experimental, preclinical, and clinical studies have been conducted, and encouraging results have been obtained. The present review exhaustively discusses various kinds of stem cells, their usage in treating neurodegenerative disorders, limitations and challenges, and ethical issues related to stem cell therapy.",

Unfortunately, a direct approach for monitoring neurotransmitter chemistry in single vesicles in fresh brain tissue has remained inaccessible so far. Here, we introduce an innovative platform of single-vesicle electrochemistry (SVE) in fresh brain tissue, enabling the quantification of neurotransmitters at the single-vesicle level for both soma and varicosity. Utilizing this methodology, we investigated a PD animal model, which demonstrated a significant reduction in both vesicular dopamine (DA) storage and exocytotic release in DA neurons in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, SVE unveiled the heterogeneous nature of chemical neurotransmission among DA neurons across different brain regions. Importantly, this tissue-based SVE approach can be extended to quantify other monoamine neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, at the single-vesicle level. The introduction of this methodology marks a significant advancement, offering a novel avenue to explore neurological and psychiatric disorders through the lens of neurotransmitter signaling in the mammalian brain.

AD is characterized not only by pathological hallmarks such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also by impairments in synaptic physiology, circuit activity and cognitive function. Synaptic homeostatic plasticity plays a vital role in maintaining the stability of synaptic and neural functions amid genetic and environmental disturbances. A key component of this regulation is presynaptic homeostatic potentiation, where increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release compensates for reduced postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, thereby stabilizing neuronal excitability. The role of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in synapse stabilization in AD, however, remains unclear. Moreover, recent advances in transcriptomics have illuminated the complex roles of glial cells in regulating synaptic function in ageing brains and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the impact of AD-related abnormalities in glial signalling on synaptic homeostatic plasticity has not been fully delineated. This review discusses recent findings on how glial dysregulation in AD affects presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. There is increasing evidence that disrupted glial signalling, particularly through aberrant histone acetylation and transcriptomic changes in glia, compromises this plasticity in AD. Notably, the sphingosine signalling pathway has been identified as being protective in stabilizing synaptic physiology through epigenetic and homeostatic mechanisms, presenting potential therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "ArticleTitle": "WDR49-Positive Astrocytes Mark Severity of Neurodegeneration in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "AbstractText": "A subpopulation of astrocytes expressing WD Repeat Domain 49 (WDR49) was recently identified in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with GRN pathogenic variants. This is the first study to investigate their expression and relation to pathology in other FTLD subtypes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a postmortem cohort of TDP-43 proteinopathies (12 GRN, 11 C9orf72, 9 sporadic TDP-43), tauopathies (13 MAPT, 8 sporadic tau), 10 AD, and four controls, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed for WDR49 and pathological inclusions on frontal, temporal, and occipital cortical sections. WDR49-positive cell counts (adjusted per mm2) were examined and related to digitally quantified percentage areas of TDP-43/tau pathology and semiquantitative scores of neurodegeneration. Quantitative colocalization analysis of WDR49 and pathological inclusions was done. WDR49-positive astrocytes were present across FTLD subtypes and AD in the brain parenchyma and (peri-)vascular space, with distinct morphological patterns, and were particularly enriched in gray matter. In controls, sporadic WDR49-positive cells were found enveloping vessels. WDR49-positive astrocytes were most abundant in the frontal cortex (FC) of GRN cases and temporal cortex in GRN, AD, and sporadic primary tauopathy. In the occipital cortex, only a few cells were found across groups. WDR49-positive astrocyte counts positively correlated with the severity of neurodegeneration and TDP-43 pathology but not tauopathy. Furthermore, in frontotemporal cortices, WDR49 partly colocalized with TDP-43 (14%-21%) and tau (31%-45%). In conclusion, WDR49 is a marker for a subset of astrocytes with different morphologies across FTLD and AD, reflecting the severity of neurodegeneration. These astrocytes may become activated in neurodegeneration in response to pathological damage and migrate from the vessel wall to the parenchyma.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated after amyloid peptide (Aβ42) accumulation. In this study, we isolated a new antioxidant molecule from the sun coral Tubastraea tagusensis and analysed it in cells exposed to oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (oAβ42). The coral was collected and immersed in methanol for the release of compounds, which were submitted to antioxidant DPPH and FRAP activity-guided fractionation using solid-phase extraction and HPLC. An active pure molecule was analysed by mass spectrometry and tested in SH-SY5Y differentiated neurons previously exposed to 5 μM oAβ42. The isolated active molecule was identified as tubastrine, which could significantly inhibit the cell death caused by the amyloid peptide. Moreover, oAβ42 increased the percentage of ROS in neurons-like from 40% to 65%, and the treatment with tubastrine reduced it to 50%. The antioxidant power of neurons-like after oAβ42 decreased significantly, while the compound reversed it, reaching similar values to the untreated cells. Therefore, tubastrine can reverse an important pathophysiological mechanism of AD, oxidative stress, by increasing neuronal antioxidant power and reducing ROS levels, able to prevent neuron-like cell death caused by oAβ42.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The Italian Fund for Alzheimer's and other dementias approved in 2020 enabled the conducting of a survey in the Italian Centers for Cognitive Disorders and Dementias (CCDDs) to analyse the organization, the administrative features and the professionals' characteristics. AIMS: To investigate the current use of neuropsychological (NP) tests in Italian CCDDs and the association between the use of a basic set of tests for neuropsychological assessment (NPA) and organizational/structural characteristics of CCDDs. METHODS: A survey was conducted with an online questionnaire in all CCDDs between July 2022 and February 2023. To verify the use of a comprehensive NPA in the diagnosis of cognitive disorders and dementia, we identified a minimum core test (MCT). RESULTS: The CCDDs using a Minimum Core Test (MCT) significantly increased from 45.7% in 2015 to the current 57.1%. Territorial CCDDs using MCT significantly increased from 24.9% in 2015 to 37% in 2022 (p = 0.004). As multivariable results, the presence of psychologist/neuropsychologist in the staff and the University-based/IRCCS CCDDs increased the probability of using MCT (OR = 9.2; 95% CI 5.6-15.0; p < 0.001 and OR = 5.4; 95% CI 1.9-15.9; p = 0.002, respectively), while CCDDs in Southern Italy-Islands showed a lower probability than those in the North (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.7; p = 0.001). DISCUSSION: Almost half of CCDDs (43%) do not use MCT in their clinical practice. The presence of the psychologist/neuropsychologist on the staff has a key role in the adoption of MCT and regional differences have increased over the past years. NPA is crucial in the diagnostic process and in characterizing risk profiles in order to implement targeted interventions for risk reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results could help to identify good practices aimed at improving dementia diagnosis. An intervention by health policymakers is urgently needed with the aim of improving diagnostic appropriateness and overcoming regional differences.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in elderly. The neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT) induces neurodegenerative changes, as observed in AD. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin (SV) has shown protective and promising therapeutic effects in neurological disorders such as AD and Parkinson's disease. The present study aimed to assess neuroprotective effect of simvastatin (SV) against trimethyltin (TMT) memory decline and hippocampal neurodegeneration. For inducing AD-like phenotype, rats were i.p. injected with TMT at 8 mg/kg and were treated with simvastatin daily for 3 weeks at 10 or 30 mg/kg. Our analysis of data indicated that simvastatin-treated TMT group has lower learning and memory deficits in behavioral tasks comprising Barnes maze, Y maze, and novel object discrimination (NOD). In addition, hippocampal inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotic factors were attenuated besides reduction of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Alzheimer's pathology factors including presenilin-1 and hyperphorphorylated Tau (p-Tau) upon simvastatin. Moreover, simvastatin treatment of TMT group inverted hippocampal changes of Wnt, β-catenin, ERK, and Akt, ameliorated astrocytic and microglial reactivity, and also prevented injury of CA1 neurons. This study unraveled that simvastatin is capable to prevent TMT-induced Alzheimer's-like phenotype in association with Wnt/β-catenin/ERK/Akt as well as restraining hippocampal neurodegeneration.",

Biological networks, such as protein-protein interaction networks and gene regulatory networks, provide insights into the molecular basis of cellular processes and often form functional clusters in different tissue and disease contexts. RESULTS: We present scGraph2Vec, a deep learning framework for generating informative gene embeddings. scGraph2Vec extends the variational graph autoencoder framework and integrates single-cell datasets and gene-gene interaction networks. We demonstrate that the gene embeddings are biologically interpretable and enable the identification of gene clusters representing functional or tissue-specific cellular processes. By comparing similar tools, we showed that scGraph2Vec clearly distinguished different gene clusters and aggregated more biologically functional genes. scGraph2Vec can be widely applied in diverse biological contexts. We illustrated that the embeddings generated by scGraph2Vec can infer disease-associated genes from genome-wide association study data (e.g., COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease), identify additional driver genes in lung adenocarcinoma, and reveal regulatory genes responsible for maintaining or transitioning melanoma cell states. CONCLUSIONS: scGraph2Vec not only reconstructs tissue-specific gene networks but also obtains a latent representation of genes implying their biological functions.",

    "AbstractText": "The disease amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death gradually accumulate throughout Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in cognitive decline and functional disability. The challenges of dataset quality, interpretability, ethical integration, population variety, and picture standardization must be addressed using deep learning for the functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification of AD in order to guarantee a trustworthy and practical therapeutic application. In this manuscript Classifying AD using a finite basis physics neural network (CAD-FBPINN) is proposed. Initially, images are collected from AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The images are fed to Pre-processing segment. During the preprocessing phase the reverse lognormal Kalman filter (RLKF) is used to enhance the input images. Then the preprocessed images are given to the feature extraction process. Feature extraction is done by Newton-time-extracting wavelet transform (NTEWT), which is used to extract the statistical features such as the mean, kurtosis, and skewness. Finally the features extracted are given to FBPINNs for Classifying AD such as early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), normal control (NC), and subjective memory complaints (SMCs). In General, FBPINN does not express adapting optimization strategies to determine optimal factors to ensure correct AD classification. Hence, sea-horse optimization algorithm (SHOA) to optimize FBPINN, which accurately classifies AD. The proposed technique implemented in python and efficacy of the CAD-FBPINN technique is assessed with support of numerous performances like accuracy, precision, Recall, F1-score, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) is analyzed. Proposed CAD-FBPINN method attain 30.53%, 23.34%, and 32.64% higher accuracy; 20.53%, 25.34%, and 29.64% higher precision; 20.53%, 25.34%, and 29.64% higher NP values analyzed with the existing for Classifying AD Stages through Brain Modifications using FBPINNs Optimized with sea-horse optimizer. Then, the effectiveness of the CAD-FBPINN technique is compared to other methods that are currently in use, such as AD diagnosis and classification using a convolution neural network algorithm (DC-AD-AlexNet), Predicting diagnosis 4 years before Alzheimer's disease incident (PDP-ADI-GCNN), and Using the DC-AD-AlexNet convolution neural network algorithm, diagnose and classify AD.",

In addition, psychobehavioral symptoms including severe sleep disorders, depression and anxiety can occur in most patients with AD. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 68-year-old woman with a 2-year history of AD. She initially presented with memory loss, progressively more severe, leading to a depressive and anxious status. The clinical symptoms also included severe sleep disturbances. Considering the age and health state of the patient, a non-pharmacological treatment of bright light therapy was used to improve her sleep quality. The treatment was provided for 30 minutes twice a day, during 8:30 am to 9:00 am and 16:30 pm to 17:00 pm. After 4 weeks of therapy, the sleep quality notably improved, with a marked decrease in daytime sleep, increase in nighttime sleep, and disappearance of nocturnal activity. The depression and anxiety were also suppressed significantly. CONCLUSION: This case report suggested that bright light therapy can have a positive effect on sleep quality in elderly patients with AD and can be used as an effective and safe non-pharmacological treatment.",

    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the associations of brain age gap (BAG)-a biological marker of brain resilience-with life exposures, neuroimaging measures, biological processes, and cognitive function. METHODS: We derived BAG by subtracting predicted brain age from chronological age in 739 septuagenarians without dementia or neurological disorders. Robust linear regression models assessed BAG associations with life exposures, plasma inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration and vascular brain injury, and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Greater BAG (older-looking brains) was associated with physical inactivity, diabetes, and stroke, while prediabetes was related to lower BAG, that is, younger-looking brains. Physical activity mitigated the link between obesity and BAG. Greater BAG was associated with greater small vessel disease burden, white-matter alterations, inflammation, high glucose, poorer vascular-related cognitive domains. Sex-specific associations were identified. DISCUSSION: Vascular-related lifestyles and health shape brain appearance. Inflammation and insulin-related processes may be keys to understanding vascular cognitive disorders. HIGHLIGHTS: BAG, reflecting deviations from CA, can indicate resilience. Diabetes, stroke, and low physical activity link to \"older\" brains (greater BAG). Physical activity yielded to \"younger\" brains in septuagenarians with obesity. High cerebrovascular burden, inflammation, and glucose associate with \"older\" brains. Sex differences were detected in all BAG-associated factors.",

The aim of the present randomized controlled study was to assess the benefits of AOT treatment in the activities of daily living (ADLs) and in the linguistic abilities of the patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) at mild-moderate stage (Hoehn & Yahr's stage scale: 2-3). METHODS: Twenty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to an experimental group (submitted to AOT) or to a control group. The experimental group (AOT-group) underwent the vision of a video containing 6 complex ADLs, while the control group (C-group) was subjected to a video-clip regarding semantic information of a geographical-naturalistic type without motor content. The treatment duration was 4 weeks. All patients underwent assessment before and after the treatment by the following tools: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-Part III), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS) and subtest Verb Naming of Analysis of Aphasic Deficit Battery (BADA). Paired samples t test was performed to compare all the variables of interest in the time, dividing by groups. p-value<0.05 was considered significant in all analyses. RESULTS: AOT-group showed an improvement from baseline to the end of study in ADCS-ADL (p = 0.001), BADA (p = 0.011) and DAFS (p = 0.005), while C-group did not change significantly in the time. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest the potential efficacy of AOT in rehabilitation of ADLs and verb retrieval in people with PD.

These symptoms significantly increase caregiver stress and institutionalization rates, and more importantly they are correlated with faster cognitive decline. However, the neuronal basis of NPS in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we review current understanding of NPS and related pathology in studies of AD patients and AD mouse models. Clinical studies indicate that NPS prevalence and severity vary across different AD stages and types. Neuroimaging and postmortem studies have suggested that pathological changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala are linked to NPS, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Studies of AD mouse models have indicated that amyloid-beta and tau-related neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex are correlated with NPS-like behavioral deficits. A better understanding of the NPS phenotypes and related pathological changes will pave the way for developing a better management strategy for NPS in AD patients.",

Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury. Additionally, neurological complications, including cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation, have been observed in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to acute kidney injury, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), emphasizing its effects on pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance, and the regulation of gluconeogenesis. We also explore how SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological complications, detailing the intricate pathways of neuro-invasion and the potential to trigger conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). By elucidating the metabolic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, this review underscores the imperative for continued research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term and short-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Despite CSF analysis being a safe and cost-effective diagnostic method, the use of CSF biomarkers in the evaluation of potential AD remains limited in Australian clinical practice due to a variety of factors, including regional access challenges, concerns over the perceived invasiveness of LP and a lack of confidence among clinicians in interpreting the results. The advent of disease-modifying therapies as a potential new treatment strategy to reduce the rate of progression in people with AD will drive the demand for early diagnosis of AD.

Beyond these conditions, recent evidence indicates that dysregulated redox balance is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine, sulforaphane, alpha-lipoic acid, L-carnitine, ascorbic acid, selenocompounds, flavones and zinc, in alleviating neuropsychiatric symptoms by mitigating excitotoxicity, enhancing synaptic plasticity, reducing microglial overactivation and promoting synaptogenesis.

It has been well established that parieto-temporal hypometabolism on FDG-PET is closely associated with medial temporal atrophy on MRI in Alzheimer's disease. Substantial biological heterogeneity, expressed as distinct subtypes of hypometabolism or atrophy patterns, has been previously described in Alzheimer's disease using data-driven and hypothesis-driven methods. However, the link between these two imaging modalities has not yet been explored in the context of Alzheimer's disease subtypes. To investigate this link, the current study utilized FDG-PET and MRI scans from 180 amyloid-beta positive Alzheimer's disease dementia patients, 339 amyloid-beta positive mild cognitive impairment and 176 amyloid-beta negative cognitively normal controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Random forest hierarchical clustering, a data-driven model for identifying subtypes, was implemented in the two modalities: one with standard uptake value ratios and the other with grey matter volumes. Five hypometabolism- and atrophy-based subtypes were identified, exhibiting both cortical-predominant and limbic-predominant patterns although with differing percentages and clinical presentations. Three cortical-predominant hypometabolism subtypes found were Cortical Predominant (32%), Cortical Predominant+ (11%) and Cortical Predominant posterior (8%), and two limbic-predominant hypometabolism subtypes found were Limbic Predominant (36%) and Limbic Predominant frontal (13%). In addition, little atrophy (minimal) and widespread (diffuse) neurodegeneration subtypes were observed from the MRI data. The five atrophy subtypes found were Cortical Predominant (19%), Limbic Predominant (27%), Diffuse (29%), Diffuse+ (6%) and Minimal (19%). Inter-modality comparisons showed that all FDG-PET subtypes displayed medial temporal atrophy, whereas the distinct MRI subtypes showed topographically similar hypometabolic patterns. Further, allocations of FDG-PET and MRI subtypes were not consistent when compared at an individual level. Additional analysis comparing the data-driven clustering model with prior hypothesis-driven methods showed only partial agreement between these subtyping methods. FDG-PET subtypes had greater differences between limbic-predominant and cortical-predominant patterns, and MRI subtypes had greater differences in severity of atrophy. In conclusion, this study highlighted that Alzheimer's disease subtypes identified using both FDG-PET and MRI capture distinct pathways showing cortical versus limbic predominance of neurodegeneration. However, the subtypes do not share a bidirectional relationship between modalities and are thus not interchangeable.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly, which is clinically characterized by a gradual and progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. The central and early role of β-amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is supported by a plethora of studies including genetic analyses, biomarker research and genome-wide association studies in both familial (early-onset) and sporadic (late-onset) forms of Alzheimer's. Monoclonal antibodies directed against β-amyloid demonstrate slowing of the clinical deterioration of patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab clinical trials showed slowing of Alzheimer's disease progression on composite scores by 25-40% based on the measure used. Anti-β-amyloid antibodies can cause side effects of bleeding and swelling in the brain, called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities typically occur early in treatment and are often asymptomatic, and though in rare cases, they can lead to serious or life-threatening events.

    "ArticleTitle": "Exploring Tractography: An Analysis of Brain Connectivity Patterns in Men.",
    "AbstractText": "INTRODUCTION: White matter tracts that connect different parts of the brain comprise the structural connectome, which is essential to its operation. Assessing behavioral changes and brain health requires an understanding of these tracts. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in particular, allows for the thorough viewing and characterization of these routes in tractography. In order to assess the impact of aging on white matter integrity, this study examines the 10 main white matter tracts in men, paying particular attention to volume, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 49 men aged 18-50 years was examined using a Philips Multiva 1.5T MRI. DTI scans were performed after obtaining informed consent. Participants with neuronal disorders were excluded. Ten tracts were assessed: inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), cingulum, corticospinal tract (CST), forceps major, forceps minor, uncinate fasciculus, and anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Statistical analysis employed Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare age groups. RESULTS: Significant age-related differences were observed in the IFOF, which exhibited notable changes in both volume and MD. Specifically, the IFOF's volume peaked in the 31-40 age group (14.42 ± 6.05) and declined in the 41-50 age group (8.71 ± 5.07), with a statistically significant p-value of 0.019. In parallel, MD increased significantly with age, moving from 0.86 ± 0.08 in the 18-30 group to 1.09 ± 0.13 in the 31-40 group and stabilizing at 0.96 ± 0.12 in the 41-50 group (p < 0.001). Notably, while the FA values remained relatively stable across age groups (p = 0.063), the increase in MD suggests a decline in neural efficiency or potential myelin degradation. Other tracts, including the SFOF and SLF, displayed stability in volume, FA, and MD across age groups, indicating a degree of resilience in certain neural pathways. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the utility of tractography in understanding age-related changes in white matter, such as in Alzheimer's disease, age- and sex-related abnormalities, and dementia, particularly emphasizing the IFOF's sensitivity. Findings offer insights into brain connectivity and neurological health, indicating a need for further contribution to inform interventions aimed at cognitive preservation.",

    "ArticleTitle": "The Neuroprotective Effect of Rooibos Herbal Tea Against Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.",
    "AbstractText": "The world is experiencing a demographic shift toward an increasing proportion of elderly persons. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurological disorders are far more likely to develop as people age. AD is a gradual, irreversible, and degenerative brain disorder that progressively deteriorates memory and cognitive function, eventually leading to death. Treatment for AD is the most significant unmet clinical need in neurology. There are no effective treatment options to prevent or reverse the degenerative process. The current medical management focuses primarily on temporarily easing symptoms, with little or no overall improvement. Although genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors influence the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, recent research suggests that dietary polyphenols with solid antioxidant capacities play crucial roles in determining brain health and aging. Aspalathus linearis is used to produce Rooibos, a popular South African herbal tea, which may modulate neurodegenerative mechanisms such as oxidative stress, tau protein, amyloid plaques, inflammation, and metals, all of which have been associated with AD. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of Rooibos and its major flavonoids and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Tele-neuropsychological multidomain assessment in Italian people with cognitive disorders: Reliability and user satisfaction.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Tele-neuropsychology has already been employed in neurocognitive disorders, however, in Italy, the evidence of its psychometric quality and satisfaction is still limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to: (1) evaluate the reliability of a standardized battery of neuropsychological screening and domain-specific tests delivered at home via videoconference to a sample of Italian people with cognitive disorders, compared with traditional face-to-face administration; (2) assess the feasibility and satisfaction about remote administration. METHODS: This crossover study enrolled patients with subjective cognitive disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, or dementia. All participants performed a brief neuropsychological screening assessment in face-to-face or remote mode. People with milder cognitive disorders (Mini-Mental State Examination ≥ 20) also performed an extended neuropsychological battery. After 15 days, each participant repeated the same assessment in the opposite mode. Finally, participants completed a satisfaction questionnaire. RESULTS: 114 participants were initially enrolled in the study and 100 individuals performed both face-to-face and remote assessments (14 dropouts). All neuropsychological tests showed agreement between the two modes of administration, except for the Digit Span Forward (p = 0.009) and oral-Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p < 0.001). According to Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCCs), tests also showed good or excellent reliability (LCCCs between 0.609 and 0.964); only the Digit Span Backward and the Stroop test showed moderate reliability (LCCCs =0.514-0.441, respectively). Among 100 participants, 65 patients answered the satisfaction questionnaire, declaring high satisfaction for the remote evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Tele-neuropsychology seems to work with in-home assessments among Italian patients with cognitive disorders and seems to be acceptable to them.

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between subtle cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as measured by biomarkers in settings outside of specialty memory clinics is not well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how subtle longitudinal cognitive decline relates to neuroimaging biomarkers in individuals drawn from a population-based study in an economically depressed, small-town area in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA. METHODS: A subset of participants without dementia (N = 115, age 76.53 years ± 6.25) from the Monongahela Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) study completed neuroimaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-signature region cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) for amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and [18F]AV-1451-PET for tau deposition. Neuropsychological evaluations were completed at multiple timepoints up to 11 years prior to neuroimaging. Aβ positivity was determined using a regional approach. We used linear mixed models to examine neuroimaging biomarker associations with retrospective cognitive slopes in five domains and a global cognitive composite. RESULTS: Among Aβ(+) participants (38%), there were associations between (i) tau Braak III/IV and language decline (p < 0.05), (ii) cortical thickness and both memory decline (p < 0.001) and global cognitive decline (p < 0.01), and (iii) WMH and decline in executive function (p < 0.05) and global cognition (p < 0.05). Among Aβ(-) participants, there was an association between tau Braak III/IV and decline on tests of attention/psychomotor speed (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm an Aβ-dependent early AD biomarker pathway, and suggest a possible Aβ-independent, non-AD process underlying subtle cognitive decline in a population-based sample of older adults without dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "In this study, the use of functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as a fluorescent probe has been investigated for the quantitative determination of galantamine, a choline esterase inhibitor used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The GQDs exhibit a significant quenching in their fluorescence intensity upon interaction with galantamine allowing for sensitive and selective detection of the drug. This quenching process follows a dynamic pattern with a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and the concentration of galantamine. Several factors affecting the quenching process were investigated and optimized, including the concentration of GQDs, the pH of the solution, and the incubation time. The proposed probe exhibited excellent analytical performance with a linear range of 10-500 ng/mL, a limit of detection of 15 ng/mL, accuracy of 100.78 ± 0.698%, and intraday and interday precision of 0.742 and 1.369%, respectively. Furthermore, the GQDs-based sensor exhibited good selectivity towards galantamine in the presence of potentially interfering substances. Another advantage of the GQDs-based sensor is its greenness evaluation, as it offers a more environmentally friendly alternative compared to traditional methods. In addition, the GQDs-based sensor was successfully applied to analyze galantamine in pharmaceutical samples and in vivo samples, demonstrating its potential for pharmacokinetics monitoring.",

    "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. In this study, we explored the critical role of autophagy in AD pathology using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD model in Wistar rats. The experimental groups included sham, STZ-induced AD, and STZ + MCC950-treated animals. Our findings revealed that administering two doses of STZ (3 mg/kg) intracerebroventricular at the interval of 48 h (on days 0 and 2), triggered autophagy, as evidenced by elevated levels of autophagy markers such as LC3II, ULK1, Beclin1, Ambra1, Cathepsin B, and a reduction in p62 levels. Behavioral assessments, including the water maze and novel object recognition tests, confirmed cognitive deficits and memory impairment, while the open-field test indicated increased anxiety in STZ-induced AD rats. In particular, treating the STZ-induced AD group with MCC950 (50 mg/kg) decreased the overexpression of autophagy-related proteins, which was consistent with better behavioral outcomes and lower anxiety. Overall, this study highlights new insights into AD pathophysiology and suggests potential therapeutic avenues.",

Alzheimer's disease, which is by far the most prevalent cause of dementia (around 80% of all dementia cases) was not included as an outcome. Evidence shows CETP inhibition is unlikely to affect Alzheimer's risk and may even potentially modestly increase risk. There is also little evidence to support an effect of CETP inhibition on all-cause or vascular dementia. Thus, CETP inhibition is unlikely to be a viable target to treat the most prevalent causes of dementia.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: The advent of Alzheimer's disease-modifying drugs requires accurate biological diagnosis to identify candidates for these therapies. So far, the most promising single plasma biomarker is phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217). To understand its biological features, it is essential to know its longitudinal trajectory and factors influencing it in cognitively unimpaired subjects with no brain pathology. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal plasma p-tau217 values (mean follow-up time = 768.3 days) in a cohort of 209 healthy volunteers. We have studied factors associated with plasma p-tau217 changes by using different linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In amyloid-negative cognitively healthy subjects (n = 151) carriers of ApoE ε4 allele had significantly higher p-tau217 values than non-carriers (0.85 pg/mL; p-value < 0.001) and also a greater rate of change (0.01 pg/mL/year; p-value < 0.001). In the overall sample, including subjects with amyloid and tau pathology we have seen that amyloid positive subjects had higher predicted baseline plasma p-tau217 values than amyloid negative subjects (0.16 pg/mL; p-value < 0.001) and a greater rate of change (0.00004 pg/mL/day; p-value < 0.001). Subjects considered tau positive also showed a greater rate of change of p-tau217 with respect to tau negative (0.00005 pg/mL/day; p-value < 0.001). A + T + N + participants showed a higher baseline p-tau217 levels than A-T-N- subjects (0.2 pg/mL; p-value < 0.001) and also a greater rate of change (0.00006 pg/mL/day; p-value = 0.002). ApoE ε4 carriers had a greater rate of change than non-carriers (0.00003 pg/mL/day; p-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In amyloid-negative cognitively unimpaired subjects, ApoE4 status influenced both baseline levels and rate of change of plasma p-tau217. Other factors such as age, sex or glomerular filtration rate have not shown significant influence on plasma p-tau217 levels in this group.",

RESULTS: The patient developed mild ARIA-H after his 13th infusion that was proceeded by left temporo-occipital hemorrhage following his 14th infusion. DISCUSSION: Although APOE ε2 is known to be protective against Alzheimer's disease, it has also been shown to increase risk for hemorrhage with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This case serves as an opportunity to examine the complex role that APOE ε2 plays in both protection against Alzheimer's disease and contribution to increased hemorrhagic risk with lecanemab.",

METHODS: This study aims to analyze gender differences in sociodemographic factors associated with the willingness to participate in clinical trials and undergo specific procedures in the context of an Alzheimer's disease prevention research cohort. 2544 cognitively unimpaired participants from the ALFA parent cohort (age 45-75 years) of the Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center were contacted through a structured phone call to determine their willingness to participate in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials and undergo trial-related procedures (magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, positron emission tomography, and cognitive assessment). Sociodemographic data on education, occupational attainment, civil and caregiver status were gathered. Stepwise logistic regression models were performed in order to study the interaction between gender and sociodemographic factors in the willingness to participate in clinical trials and to undergo clinical trial-related procedures. RESULTS: 1,606 out of the 2,544 participants were women (63.1%). Women were significantly younger and had lower educational attainment compared with men. In addition, women were more likely to be caregivers, single and unemployed. Women showed a significantly lower willingness than men to participate in a clinical trial (p = 0.003) and to undergo a lumbar puncture (p < 0.001). Single women were less willing to participate in clinical trials than single men (p = 0.041). Regarding clinical trial-related procedures, women with higher years of education were significantly less willing to undergo a lumbar puncture (p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: We found gender differences regarding the sociodemographic factors that predict the willingness to participate in clinical trials and to undergo clinical trial-related procedures. Our results highlight the urgent need to design recruitment strategies accounting for gender-related factors, particularly those related to marital status and education.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Structural and functional alterations of neurons derived from sporadic Alzheimer's disease hiPSCs are associated with downregulation of the LIMK1-cofilin axis.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of pathological proteins and synaptic dysfunction. This study aims to investigate the molecular and functional differences between human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with sporadic AD (sAD) and age-matched controls (healthy subjects, HS), focusing on their neuronal differentiation and synaptic properties in order to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology. METHODS: Skin fibroblasts from sAD patients (n = 5) and HS subjects (n = 5) were reprogrammed into hiPSCs using non-integrating Sendai virus vectors. Through karyotyping, we assessed pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, TRA-1-60) and genomic integrity. Neuronal differentiation was evaluated by immunostaining for MAP2 and NEUN. Electrophysiological properties were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp, while protein expression of Aβ, phosphorylated tau, Synapsin-1, Synaptophysin, PSD95, and GluA1 was quantified by western blot. We then focused on PAK1-LIMK1-Cofilin signaling, which plays a key role in regulating synaptic structure and function, both of which are disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. RESULTS: sAD and HS hiPSCs displayed similar stemness features and genomic stability. However, they differed in neuronal differentiation and function. sAD-derived neurons (sAD-hNs) displayed increased levels of AD-related proteins, including Aβ and phosphorylated tau. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that while both sAD- and HS-hNs generated action potentials, sAD-hNs exhibited decreased spontaneous synaptic activity. Significant reductions in the expression of synaptic proteins such as Synapsin-1, Synaptophysin, PSD95, and GluA1 were found in sAD-hNs, which are also characterized by reduced neurite length, indicating impaired differentiation. Notably, sAD-hNs demonstrated a marked reduction in LIMK1 phosphorylation, which could be the underlying cause for the changes in cytoskeletal dynamics that we found, leading to the morphological and functional modifications observed in sAD-hNs. To further investigate the involvement of the LIMK1 pathway in the morphological and functional changes observed in sAD neurons, we conducted perturbation experiments using the specific LIMK1 inhibitor, BMS-5. Neurons obtained from healthy subjects treated with the inhibitor showed similar morphological changes to those observed in sAD neurons, confirming that LIMK1 activity is crucial for maintaining normal neuronal structure. Furthermore, administration of the inhibitor to sAD neurons did not exacerbate the morphological alterations, suggesting that LIMK1 activity is already compromised in these cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that although sAD- and HS-hiPSCs are similar in their stemness and genomic stability, sAD-hNs exhibit distinct functional and structural anomalies mirroring AD pathology. These anomalies include synaptic dysfunction, altered cytoskeletal organization, and accumulation of AD-related proteins. Our study underscores the usefulness of hiPSCs in modeling AD and provides insights into the disease's molecular underpinnings, thus highlighting potential therapeutic targets.",

Here, we performed a comprehensive method comparison study, followed by evaluation of the diagnostic performance of eight recent plasma p-tau immunoassays targeting different tau phosphorylation sites, different tau fragments, and that are measured by two distinct platforms. METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of 40 patients with AD at the stage of dementia (AD-dem) characterized by positive CSF A + T + profile, and a control group of 40 cognitively healthy participants (Control), to conduct a comprehensive method comparison for three plasma p-tau181 and five plasma p-tau217 assays run on the Simoa® HD-X™ or Lumipulse® G600II/G1200 platforms. Design of the compared assays differed in regard to: (1) tau phosphorylation site targeted by the capture antibody (T181 or T217), and (2) epitope of the pan-tau detector antibody (N-terminal or mid-region). For each of the assays we determined precision and analytical sensitivity parameters and used Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman plots for pairwise comparison of p-tau181 or p-tau217 assays. Subsequently, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of all the assays for discrimination between AD-dem and Control groups. RESULTS: We found a strong, positive correlation between all the measurements. Fixed and/or proportional bias was observed for each of compared p-tau181 assay pairs or p-tau217 assay pairs. While both plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels were significantly increased in AD-dem vs. Control groups as measured by all assays, higher median concentration AD-dem/Control fold change and AUC values were observed for p-tau217 (assays range: fold change 3.72-6.74, AUC 0.916-0.956) compared with p-tau181 (assays range 1.81-2.94, AUC 0.829-0.909), independently of the platform used. No significant differences were observed between diagnostic performance of p-tau181 assays or p-tau217 assays targeting tau N-terminus or mid-region. CONCLUSIONS: Although all plasma p-tau measurements enabled discrimination between clinical groups, p-tau217 assays showed the highest robustness, independently of the pan-tau detector antibody targeting N-terminal or mid-region, and independently of the platform used. Considering the observed method disagreement in measured absolute concentrations, we stress the need for development of certified reference material, harmonizing measurements across different platforms.",

    "ArticleTitle": "Effects of Probucol on plasma amyloid-β transport in patients with hyperlipidemia: a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",
    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: Although dyslipidemia has been acknowledged as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on AD have not been determined. The primary pathophysiological hallmark of AD is the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain. Plasma Aβ levels are influenced by the transport of Aβ from the central nervous system to the peripheral blood. This study investigates the effects of Probucol, a lipid-lowering and antioxidant drug, on plasma Aβ transport. METHODS: A total of 120 hyperlipidemic patients with normal cognition were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either Probucol (1000 mg daily for 12 weeks) or a placebo. Plasma Aβ, soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), and fasting lipid profiles were measured at baseline and every 6 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 108 participants completed the study, with 55 in the Probucol group. The cohort consisted of 58 (53.7%) women, with a mean age of 58.4 ± 8.0 (range, 45-80) years. After 12 weeks of treatment, the changes in plasma Aβ42 and sRAGE levels significantly differed between the Probucol and placebo groups (ΔAβ42: β = 6.827, P = 0.030; ΔsRAGE: β = 98.668, P = 0.004). Furthermore, ΔsRAGE was positively correlated with the change in Aβ42 (β = 0.018, P = 0.048). When adjusted for ΔsRAGE, the effect of Probucol on plasma Aβ42 levels was attenuated (β = 5.065, P = 0.116). In the Probucol group only, ΔsRAGE was significantly correlated with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (β = 4.27, P = 0.011), total cholesterol (β = 67.50, P = 0.046), and low-density lipoproteins (β = - 91.01, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral administration of Probucol (1000 mg) for 12 weeks significantly increased plasma Aβ42 levels, likely through modulation of sRAGE. This effect may be attributed to the antioxidant and lipid-lowering properties of Probucol. These findings suggest that Probucol could potentially serve as a protective agent against the pathological processes of AD.

    "AbstractText": "Feather pecking (FP) is a repetitive behaviour in chickens, influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, similar to behaviours seen in human developmental disorders (e.g., hyperactivity, autism). This study examines genetic and neuro-epigenetic factors in the thalamus of chickens from lines selected for seven generations for high or low FP behaviour (HFP or LFP). We integrate data on Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and Copy Number Variations (CNVs) in this controlled artificial selection process. Significant differences in behaviour, immunology, and neurology have been reported in these lines. We identified 710 SNPs in these lines that indicate new potentially important genes for FP such as TMPRSS6 (implicated in autism), and SST and ARNT2 (somatostatin function). CNV were the omic level most affected during selection. The largest CNVs found were in RIC3 (gain in HFP) and SH3RF2 (gain in LFP) genes, linked to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor regulation and human oncogenesis, respectively. Our study also suggests that promoters and introns are hotspots for CpG depletion. The overlapping of the omic levels investigated here with data from a public FP Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) database revealed novel candidate genes for understanding repetitive behaviours, such as RTKN2, associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans. This study suggests CNVs as a crucial initial step for genomic diversification, potentially more impactful than SNPs.",

    "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND: An enriched understanding is necessary concerning the association between hypertension and cognitive impairment in older adults, particularly regarding the potential underlying mechanisms at a biological level. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the hypertension-cognition link in the older population. METHODS: A total of 2762 adults (age > = 60 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014 participated. Cognitive function was assessed using a combination of the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List Learning Test. Self-reported hypertension diagnosis, antihypertensive medications use, and blood pressure examinations were used to identify hypertension. Serum MMA (sMMA) levels were collected. Weighted multiple linear regressions and mediation analysis were applied. A subgroup analysis by sex and age was performed. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we observed a significant mediating effect of the sMMA level in the hypertension-cognition link, accounting for 11.14% (95% CI 4.09%-14.00%, p < 0.001) of the relationship in older adults. The proportion mediated by the sMMA level in the relationship between hypertension and cognitive function was higher in males (15.23%, 95%CI 1.32%-27.00%, p < 0.001) than in females (6.61%, 95%CI 2.12%-10.00%, p < 0.001). This mediating effect of sMMA was observed only in individuals aged 68 years and older (11.31%, 95%CI 3.80%-16.00%, p < 0.001), with no significant mediation detected in those younger than 68 years. CONCLUSION: Hypertension may lead to cognitive dysfunction in older adults through MMA. Apart from its role as a biomarker reflecting vitamin B12, MMA may act as an independent neurotoxin capable of inducing brain injury and cognitive impairment. Addressing MMA accumulation, such as through Vitamin B12 supplementation, may have a potential to mitigate hypertension-induced cognitive decline in older adults. Special attention could be paid to hypertensive males with an advanced age (> = 68) to address MMA-related cognitive decline.",
